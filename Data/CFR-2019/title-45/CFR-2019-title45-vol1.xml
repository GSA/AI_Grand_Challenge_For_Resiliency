      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="viii"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 2.1</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Scope, purpose, and applicability.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This part sets forth rules to be followed when an employee or former employee of the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS” or “Department”), other than an employee of the Food and Drug Administration, is requested or subpoenaed to provide testimony in a deposition, trial, or other similar proceeding concerning information acquired in the course of performing official duties or because of such person's official capacity with DHHS. This part also sets forth procedures for the handling of subpoenas duces tecum and other requests for any document in the possession of DHHS, other than the Food and Drug Administration, and for the processing of requests for certification of copies of documents. Separate regulations, 21 CFR part 20, govern the Food and Drug Administration, and those regulations are not affected by this part.</P>

            <P>(b) It is the policy of the DHHS to provide information, data, and records to non-federal litigants to the same extent and in the same manner that they are <E T="03">made</E> available to the general public <E T="03">and,</E> when subject to the jurisdiction of a court or other tribunal presiding over non-federal party litigation, to follow all applicable procedural and substantive rules relating to the production of information, data, and records by a non-party. The availability of Department employees to testify in litigation not involving federal parties is governed by the Department's policy to maintain strict impartiality with respect to private litigants and to minimize the disruption of official duties.</P>
            <P>(c) This part applies to state, local and tribal judicial, administrative, and legislative proceedings, and to federal judicial and administrative proceedings.</P>
            <P>(d) This part does not apply to:</P>
            <P>(1) Any civil or criminal proceedings where the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services, and any agency thereof, or any other Federal agency is a party.</P>
            <P>(2) Congressional requests or subpoenas for testimony or documents.</P>
            <P>(3) Consultative services and technical assistance provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, or any agency thereof, in carrying out its normal program activities.</P>
            <P>(4) Employees serving as expert witnesses in connection with professional and consultative services as approved outside activities in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.805 and 5 CFR 5501.106. (In cases where employees are providing such outside services, they must state for the record that the testimony represents their own views and does not necessarily represent the official position of the DHHS.)</P>
            <P>(5) Employees making appearances in their private capacity in legal or administrative proceedings that do not relate to the Department of Health and Human Services (such as cases arising out of traffic accidents, crimes, domestic relations, etc.) and not involving professional and consultative services.</P>
            <P>(6) Any matters covered in 21 CFR part 20-,involving the Food and Drug Administration.</P>

            <P>(7) Any civil or criminal proceedings in State court brought on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services.

              <P>While on duty, an employee of the Department witnesses an incident in which a fellow employee trips on a loose piece of carpeting and sustains an injury. The injured employee brings a private tort action against the contractor installing the carpeting and the private landlord maintaining the building. The employee/witness is served with a subpoena to appear at a deposition to testify about the incident. The person seeking the testimony would not be required to obtain Agency head approval prior to requesting the testimony, because the subject of the testimony does not “relate to” the Department, within the meaning of § 2.1(d)(5).</P>

              <P>While on duty, an employee of the Department witnesses a mugging while looking out the window to check the weather, and then notifies the local police of what she observed. She is subsequently subpoenaed to testify in a criminal proceeding. The local prosecutor would not be required to obtain Agency head approval prior to requiring the employee to testify, because the subject of the testimony does not “relate to” the Department, within the meaning of § 2.1(d)(5).</P>

The nurse is subsequently served with a subpoena to testify in a criminal proceeding against one of the child's parents concerning the injuries to the child which he observed. The local prosecutor would be required to obtain Agency head approval prior to requiring the nurse to testify, because the subject of the testimony involves “information acquired in the course of performing official duties or because of the person's official capacity,” within the meaning of § 2.1(a).</P>

The party requesting the personnel specialist to appear would be required to obtain Agency head approval prior to compelling the personnel specialist to testify, because the testimony sought involves “information acquired in the course of performing official duties or because of the person's official capacity,” within the meaning of § 2.1(a).</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 5.1</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This part implements the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, for Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) records that are subject to the FOIA. This part should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget. This part contains the rules that we follow to process FOIA requests, such as the amount of time we have to make a determination regarding the release of records, who can decide to release records and who can decide not to release them, the fees we may charge, if applicable, the reasons why some records are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA, and the administrative and legal remedies available should a requester disagree with our initial disclosure determination.</P>
              <P>(a) The FOIA provides a right of access to agency records, except to the extent that any portions of the records are protected from public disclosure by an exemption or exclusion in the statute. The FOIA does not require us to perform research for you or to answer your questions. The FOIA does not require agencies to create new records or to perform analysis of existing records; for example, by extrapolating information from existing agency records, reformatting publicly available information, preparing new electronic programs or databases, or creating data through calculations of ratios, proportions, percentages, trends, frequency distributions, correlations, or comparisons. However, at our discretion and if it would conserve government resources, we may decide to supply requested information by consolidating information from various records.</P>
              <P>(b) This part does not apply to data generated by an agency grant recipient under the provisions of 45 CFR part 75 to the extent the requirements of 45 CFR 75.322(e) do not apply to the data. We will not process your request under the FOIA or these regulations if that data is already available to the public through an archive or other source. In that situation, we will refer you to that other source. The procedures for requesting research data made available under the provisions of 45 CFR 75.322(e) are referenced in § 5.23(a).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Presumption of openness and proactive disclosures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) We will administer the FOIA with a presumption of openness. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(8) we will disclose records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption and disclosure is not prohibited by law. We also will consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever we determine that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible. This includes taking reasonable steps to segregate and release nonexempt information.</P>

              <P>(b) Records that the FOIA requires agencies to make available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through each OpDiv's and Staff Div's Web site. Each OpDiv and StaffDiv is responsible for determining which of its records must be made publicly available (including frequently requested records), for identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. Each OpDiv and StaffDiv must ensure that its Web site of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. Each OpDiv and StaffDiv has a FOIA Requester Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison who can assist individuals in locating records. A list of agency FOIA Public Liaisons is available at <E T="03">http://www.foia.gov/report-makerequest.html.</E>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Agency</E> is defined at 5 U.S.C. 551(1). HHS is an agency. Private entities performing work under a contractual agreement with the government are not agencies for the purpose of this definition. However, information maintained on behalf of an agency under Government contract, for the purposes of records management, is considered an agency record.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Chief FOIA Officer</E> means a senior official of HHS, at the Assistant Secretary or equivalent level, who has agency-wide responsibility for ensuring efficient and appropriate compliance with the FOIA, monitoring implementation of the FOIA throughout the agency, and making recommendations to the head of the agency to improve the agency's implementation of the FOIA. The Secretary of HHS has designated the Assistant Secretary, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA), as the Agency Chief FOIA Officer (ACFO); that official may be contacted at HHS.ACFO@hhs.gov.</P>
              <P>

                <E T="03">Direct costs</E> mean those expenses that an agency incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process of making a copy of a record and sending it to the requester, to the extent necessary to respond to the request. Such copies include both paper copies and electronic records. Fees for duplication are further explained within § 5.52.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution.

              <P>
                <E T="03">Fee category</E> means one of the four categories established by the FOIA to determine whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review, and duplication. The categories are: commercial use requests; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions requests; news media requests; and all other requests. Fee categories are further explained within § 5.53.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Fee waiver</E> means the waiver or reduction of fees if a requester is able to demonstrate that certain standards set forth in the FOIA and this part are satisfied, including that disclosure of the <PRTPAGE P="20"/>records is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">First-party request</E> means a request by an individual for records pertaining to that individual, or an authorized representative acting on such an individual's behalf.</P>

Apart from records subject to proactive disclosure pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of the FOIA, only FOIA Officers have the authority to release or withhold records or to waive fees in response to a FOIA request. Our FOIA operations are decentralized, and each FOIA Requester Service Center has a designated official with this authority; the contact information for each FOIA Requester Service Center is available at <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/foia/contacts/index.html</E>.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Other requester</E> means any individual or organization whose request does not qualify as a commercial-use request, representative of the news media request (including a request made by a freelance journalist), or an educational or non-commercial scientific institution request.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Record</E> means any information that would be an agency record when maintained by an agency in any format, including an electronic format; and any information that is maintained for an agency by an entity under Government contract, for the purposes of records management.</P>

The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large and publishers of periodicals, including print and online publications that disseminate news and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public. We do not consider requests for records that support the news-dissemination function of the requester to be a commercial use. We consider “freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity as working for that entity. A publishing contract provides the clearest evidence that a journalist expects publication; however, we also <PRTPAGE P="22"/>consider a requester's past publication record.</P>

              <P>The FOIA allows any person (whether an individual or entity) to request access to records. The Privacy Act, at 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), provides an additional right of access, allowing individuals to request records about themselves, if the records are maintained in a system of records (defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(5)).</P>

This includes requirements to verify your identity. We will process the request under the Privacy Act and, if it is not fully granted under the Privacy Act, we will process it under the FOIA. You may obtain, under the FOIA, information that is exempt from access under the Privacy Act, if the information is not excluded or exempt under the FOIA. If you request records about yourself that are not maintained within a system of records, we will process your request under the FOIA only.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requesting records about another individual.</E> If you request records about another individual, we will process your request under the FOIA. You may receive greater access by following the procedures described in § 5.22(g).</P>

              <P>(b) Include your name, full mailing address, and phone number and if available, your email address. This information allows us to reach you faster if we have any questions about your request. It is your responsibility to keep your current mailing address up to date with the office where you have filed the FOIA request.</P>
              <P>(c) State your willingness to pay all fees, or the maximum amount of fees you are willing to pay, and/or include a request for a fee waiver/reduction.</P>
              <P>(d) Mark both your letter and envelope, or the subject line of your email, with the words “FOIA Request.”</P>
              <P>(e) If you are unable to submit a written request to us due to circumstances such as disability or literacy, you may make a request orally to a FOIA Officer. FOIA Officers will put in writing an oral request made directly to them.</P>
              <P>(f) If you are making a first-party request, you must comply with the verification of identity procedures set forth in 45 CFR part 5b.</P>

              <P>(g) Where your request for records pertains to another individual, you may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). At our discretion, we may require you to supply additional information if necessary to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure of records about them.</P>

              <P>(h) If you are requesting the medical records of an individual other than yourself from a government program that pays or provides for health care (<E T="03">e.g.</E> Medicare, Indian Health Service) and you are not that individual's legally authorized representative, you should submit a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant release authorization form signed by the subject of records or the individual's legally authorized representative. The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that an authorization form contain certain core elements and statements which are described in the Privacy Rule's requirements at 45 CFR 164.508. If you are submitting a request for Medicare records to CMS, CMS has a release authorization form at the following link: <E T="03">ttps://www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/Downloads/CMS10106.pdf.</E>

              <SUBJECT>Where do I send my FOIA request?</SUBJECT>

              <P>We have several FOIA Requester Service Centers (FOIA offices) that process FOIA requests. You should send your FOIA request to the appropriate FOIA Requester Service Center that you believe would have the records you seek. An up-to-date listing is maintained online at <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/foia/contacts/index.html.</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="24"/>You also may submit your request electronically by emailing it to the appropriate FOIA Requester Service Center or by submitting it to the Department's web portal located at <E T="03">https://requests.publiclink.hhs.gov/palMain.aspx.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(a) If you are requesting research data made available under the provisions of 45 CFR 75.322(e), requests for such data should be addressed to the OpDiv that made the award under which the data were first produced. That OpDiv will process your request in accordance with established procedures consistent with the FOIA and 45 CFR 75.322(e).</P>
              <P>(b) We officially receive your request when it reaches the FOIA Requester Service Center with responsibility for the OpDiv or StaffDiv where requested records are likely to be located, but no later than 10 working days after the request first arrives at any of our FOIA Requester Service Centers.</P>

              <P>(c) If you have questions concerning the processing of your FOIA request, you may contact the FOIA Requester Service Center processing your request. If that initial contact does not resolve your concerns, you may wish to contact the designated FOIA Public Liaison for the OpDiv or StaffDiv processing your request. You can find a list of our FOIA Requester Service Centers and Public Liaisons at <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/foia/contacts/index.html.</E>

              <SUBJECT>How does HHS process my FOIA request?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgement.</E> We acknowledge all FOIA requests in writing within 10 working days after receipt by the appropriate office. The acknowledgement letter or email informs you of your request tracking number, provides contact information, and informs you of any complexity we are aware of in processing that may lengthen the time required to reach a final decision on the release of the records. In addition, the acknowledgement letter or email or a subsequent communication may also seek additional information to clarify your request.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Perfected requests.</E> (1) A request is considered to be perfected (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the 20 working day statutory response time begins to run) when—</P>
              <P>(i) The request either has been received by the responsible FOIA office, or, in any event, not later than 10 working days after the request has been received by any HHS FOIA office;</P>
              <P>(ii) The requested records are reasonably described; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The request contains sufficient information to enable the FOIA office to contact you and transmit records to you.</P>
              <P>(2) We provide at least 20 working days for you to respond to a request to perfect your request, after notification. Requests must reasonably describe the records sought and contain sufficient information to enable the FOIA office to contact you and transmit records to you. If we determine that a request does not meet these requirements, we will attempt to contact you if possible. Should you not answer any correspondence, or should the correspondence be returned as undeliverable, we reserve the right to administratively close the FOIA request.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Stops in processing time (tolling).</E> We may stop the processing of your request one time if we require additional information regarding the specifics of the request. The processing time resumes upon our receipt of your response. We also may stop the processing of your request if we require clarification regarding fee assessments. If additional information or clarification is required, we will attempt to contact you using the contact information you have provided. The processing time will resume upon our receipt of your response. We will provide at least 20 working days after notification for you to respond to a request for additional information or clarification regarding the specifics of your request or fee assessment. Should you not answer any correspondence, or should the correspondence be returned as undeliverable, we may administratively close the FOIA request.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Search cut-off date.</E> As the end or cut-off date for a records search, we use the date on which we first begin our search for documents responsive to your request, unless you specify an earlier cut-off date, or a specific date range for the records search. We will use the date of the first search in those cases when you request records <PRTPAGE P="25"/>“through the present,” “through today,” or similar language. The FOIA allows you to request existing agency records. The FOIA cannot be used to request records which the agency may create in the future in the course of carrying out its mission.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Processing queues.</E> We place FOIA requests in simple or complex processing queues to be processed in the order received, on a first-in, first-out basis, absent approval for expedited processing based upon a compelling need, as further explained and defined in § 5.27. We will place your request in the simple or complex processing queue based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors we may consider are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request, and the need for consultations or referrals. We will advise requesters of potential complicating factors in our acknowledgement letter or email, or in subsequent communications regarding your request and, when appropriate, we will offer requesters an opportunity to narrow or modify their request so that it can be placed in the simple processing track.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Unusual Circumstances.</E> Whenever we cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and we extend the time limit on that basis, we will notify you, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond and in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which we estimate processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, we will provide you, as described by the FOIA, with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. We will make available a designated FOIA contact in the appropriate FOIA Requester Service Center or the appropriate FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. In addition, we will inform you of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances, we may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request, involving clearly related matters, that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. In the event that requests are aggregated, they will be treated as one request for the purposes of calculating both response time and fees.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does HHS handle requests that involve more than one OpDiv, StaffDiv, or Federal agency?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Re-routing of misdirected requests.</E> When a FOIA Requester Service Center determines that a request was misdirected within HHS, the receiving FOIA Requester Service Center must route the request to the FOIA Requester Service Center of the proper OpDiv or StaffDiv within HHS.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Consultation, referral, and coordination.</E> When reviewing records located by an OpDiv or StaffDiv in response to a request, the OpDiv or StaffDiv will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the OpDiv or StaffDiv must proceed in one of the following ways:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Consultation.</E> When records originated with an OpDiv or StaffDiv processing the request, but contain within them information of interest to another OpDiv, StaffDiv, agency or other Federal Government office, the OpDiv or StaffDiv processing the request should typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Referral.</E> (i) When the OpDiv or StaffDiv processing the request believes that a different OpDiv, StaffDiv, or agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the OpDiv or StaffDiv typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that other entity. Ordinarily, the entity that originated the record is presumed to be the best entity to make the disclosure determination. However, if the OpDiv or StaffDiv processing the request and the originating entity <PRTPAGE P="26"/>jointly agree that the OpDiv or StaffDiv processing the request is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Whenever an OpDiv or StaffDiv refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another OpDiv, StaffDiv, or federal agency, it must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral; informing the requester of the name(s) of the entity to which the record was referred, including that entity's FOIA contact information.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Coordination.</E> The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the OpDiv, StaffDiv, or federal agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the OpDiv or StaffDiv that received the request should coordinate with the originating entity to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the OpDiv or StaffDiv that originally received the request.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Classified information.</E> On receipt of any request involving classified information, the OpDiv or StaffDiv must determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the OpDiv or StaffDiv must refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or which should consider the information for classification. Whenever an OpDiv's or StaffDiv's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), the OpDiv or StaffDiv must refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Timing of responses to consultations and referrals.</E> All consultations and referrals received by the Department will be handled according to the date that the FOIA request initially was received by the first OpDiv, StaffDiv, or federal agency.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.</E> OpDivs or StaffDivs may establish agreements with other OpDivs, StaffDivs, or federal agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.</P>

              <P>(a) When we provide an estimated completion date, in accordance with § 5.24(f) and upon request, for the processing of records that do not require consultation with another agency, we estimate the completion date on the basis of our reasonable judgment as to how long it will take to complete the request. Given the uncertainty inherent in establishing any estimate, the estimated completion date is subject to change at any time.</P>
              <P>(b) When we provide an estimated completion date, in accordance with § 5.24(f) and upon request, for records that must be reviewed by another agency, our estimate may also be based on information from the other agency.</P>

              <P>(a) To request expedited processing, you must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining the basis for your need for expedited processing. You must send the request to the appropriate FOIA Officer at the address listed at <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/foia/contacts/index.html.</E> You may request expedited processing when you first request records or at any time during our processing of your request or appeal.</P>

              <P>(b) We process requests on an expedited basis whenever we determine that one or more of the following criteria exist:<PRTPAGE P="27"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
              <P>(2) There is an urgent need to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity (this criterion applies only to those requests made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public).</P>
              <P>(c) We will respond to your request for expedited processing within 10 calendar days of our receipt of your request to expedite. If we grant your request, the OpDiv or StaffDiv responsible for the review of the requested records will process your request as a priority, and it will be processed as soon as practicable. We will inform you if we deny your request for expedited processing and provide you with appeal rights. If you decide to appeal that denial, we will expedite our review of your appeal.</P>
              <P>(d) If we must refer records to another agency, we will inform you and suggest that you seek expedited review from that agency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does HHS respond to my request?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The appropriate FOIA Officer will send you a response informing you of our release determination, including whether any responsive records were located, how much responsive material was located, whether the records are being released in full or withheld in full or in part, any fees you must pay for processing of the request, and your right to seek assistance from the appropriate FOIA Public Liaison.</P>
              <P>(b) If we deny any part of your request, our response will explain the reasons for the denial, which FOIA exemptions apply to the withheld records, your right to appeal that determination, and your right to seek dispute resolution services from the appropriate FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS). We will advise you of the number of pages withheld or the estimated volume of withheld records, unless providing such information would harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA exemption.</P>
              <P>(c) Records may be withheld in full or in part if any of the nine FOIA exemptions apply. If we determine to withhold part of a record pursuant to an exemption, we will provide access to reasonably segregable non-exempt information contained in the record. On the released portion of the record, we indicate where the information has been redacted and the exemption(s) we applied, unless including that indication would harm an interest the exemption protects. In Subpart C of this part, we list the exemptions to disclosure that may apply to agency records.</P>
              <P>(d) We also may deny your request for other reasons, including that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested records do not exist, cannot be located, or have been destroyed; or that the requested records are not readily reproducible in the form or format requested.</P>
              <P>(e) If a request involves a voluminous amount of material or searches in multiple locations, we may provide you with interim responses if feasible and reasonably possible, releasing the records on a rolling basis.</P>
              <P>(f) Copies of records in the format you request will be provided if the records already exist in that format or if they are reasonably and readily reproducible in the format you request.</P>

              <P>While we are committed to providing public access to as many of our records as possible, there are instances in which information falls within one or more of the FOIA's nine exemptions and disclosure would either foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption or disclosure is prohibited by law. We review all records and weigh and assess all legal and policy requirements prior to making a final disclosure determination. A description of the nine FOIA exemptions is provided in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Exemption 1.</E> Exemption 1 protects from disclosure information specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemption 4.</E> Exemption 4 authorizes our agency to withhold trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Exemption 5.</E> Exemption 5 authorizes our agency to withhold inter-agency or intra agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency, provided that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Exemption 6.</E> Exemption 6 authorizes our agency to protect information in personnel and medical files and similar files when the disclosure of such information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Exemption 7.</E> Exemption 7 authorizes our agency to withhold records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information would cause the following harm(s):</P>
              <P>(1) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>
              <P>(2) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</P>
              <P>(3) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>

              <P>(4) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a state, local, or foreign agency or authority, or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information <PRTPAGE P="29"/>compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</P>
              <P>(5) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</P>

The person may make this designation either at the time the records are submitted to the government or within a reasonable time thereafter. The designation must be in writing. Any such designation will expire 10 years after the records were submitted to the government.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does HHS process FOIA requests for confidential commercial information?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Predisclosure notification.</E> The procedures in this section apply to records on which the submitter has designated information as provided in § 5.41. They also apply to records that were submitted to the government where we have substantial reason to believe that information in the records could reasonably be considered exempt under Exemption 4. Certain exceptions to these procedures are stated in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) When we receive a request for such records, and we determine that we may be required to disclose them, we will make reasonable efforts to notify the submitter about these facts. The notice will include a copy of the request, and it will inform the submitter about the procedures and time limits for submission and consideration of objections to disclosure. If we must notify a large number of submitters, we may do this by posting or publishing a notice in a place where the submitters are reasonably likely to become aware of it.</P>

              <P>(2) The submitter has 10 working days from the date of the notice to object to disclosure of any part of the records and to state all bases for its objections. FOIA Offices in HHS and its organizational components may extend <PRTPAGE P="30"/>this period as appropriate and necessary.</P>
              <P>(3) We review and consider all objections to release that we receive within the time limit. If a submitter fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice, we will consider the submitter to have no objection to disclosure of the information. If we decide to release the records, we inform the submitter in writing, along with our reasons for the decision to release. We include with the notice a description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as we intend to release them. We also provide the submitter with a specific date that we intend to disclose the records, which must be at least 5 working days after the date of the notice. We do not consider any information we receive after the date of a disclosure decision.</P>
              <P>(4) If the requester files a lawsuit under the FOIA for access to records submitted to HHS, we promptly notify the submitter.</P>
              <P>(5) We will notify the requester in these circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) When we notify a submitter that we may be required to disclose information under the FOIA, we will also notify the requester that notice and opportunity to comment are being provided to the submitter;</P>
              <P>(ii) When the agency notifies a submitter of a final disclosure decision under the FOIA,</P>
              <P>and;</P>
              <P>(iii) When a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exceptions to predisclosure notification.</E> The notice requirements in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply in the following situations:</P>
              <P>(1) We determine that we should withhold the information under a FOIA exemption;</P>
              <P>(2) The information has been lawfully published or made available to the public</P>
              <P>(3) We are required by a statute (other than the FOIA), or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600, to disclose the information; or</P>
              <P>(4) The designation made by the submitter appears obviously frivolous. However, in such a case, the agency must provide the submitter with written notice of any final disclosure determination and intent to release, at least 5 working days prior to the specified disclosure date. We will notify the submitter as referenced in § 5.42(a)(3).</P>

              <SUBJECT>General information on fees for all FOIA requests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) We generally assume that when you request records you are willing to pay the fees we charge for services associated with your request. You may specify a limit on the amount you are willing to spend. We will notify you if it appears that the fees will exceed $25.00 or your specified limit and ask whether you nevertheless want us to proceed with the search.</P>
              <P>(b) If you have failed to pay FOIA fees in the past, we will require you to pay your past due bill and we may also require you to pay the anticipated fee before we begin processing your current request. If we estimate that your fees may be greater than $250.00, we also may require advance payment or a deposit before we begin processing your request. If you fail to make an advance payment within 20 working days after the date of our fee letter, we will close the request.</P>
              <P>(c) We may charge interest on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st calendar day following the day the FOIA fee invoice was sent. We may assess interest, administrative costs, and penalties for overdue FOIA fee costs.</P>
              <P>(d) If we determine that you (either acting alone or with a group of requesters) are breaking down a single request into a series of requests in order to avoid or reduce fees, we may aggregate all of these requests when calculating the fees. In aggregating requests, we may consider the subject matter of the requests and whether the requests were filed close in time to one another.</P>
              <P>(e) If, in the course of negotiating fees, you do not respond to the agency within 20 working days of our last communication, your request will be closed.</P>

              <P>(f) We may stop the processing of your request, if necessary, to clarify fee issues with you, and to confirm your willingness to pay applicable fees. <PRTPAGE P="31"/>Fee related issues may arise sequentially over the course of processing a request, and the FOIA allows agencies to stop the processing time as many times as necessary in order to clarify issues regarding fee assessment and willingness to pay fees.</P>
              <P>(g) We may charge search fees even if the records are exempt from disclosure, or if we do not find any responsive records during our search.</P>
              <P>(h) We do not send an invoice to requesters if assessable processing fees are less than $25.00.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 5.52</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What is the FOIA fee schedule for obtaining records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>In responding to FOIA requests for records, we charge the following fees, where applicable, unless we have given you a reduction or waiver of fees. The fees we charge for search and review are three-tiered, and the hourly charge is determined by the classification and grade level of the employee performing the search or review. When the search or review is performed by employees at grade GS-1 through GS-8 (or equivalent), an hourly rate will be charged based on the salary of a GS-5, step 7, employee; when done by a GS-9 through GS-14 (or equivalent), an hourly rate will be charged based on the salary of a GS-12, step 4,employee; and when done by a GS-15 or above (or equivalent), an hourly rate will be charged based on the salary of a GS-15, step 7, employee. In each case, the hourly rate will be computed by taking the current hourly rate listed for the specified grade and step in the General Schedule Locality Pay Table for the Locality of Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA, adding 16% of that rate to cover benefits, and rounding to the nearest whole dollar.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Search fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">Manual searches.</E> Fees will be assessed to search agency files and records in both hardcopy and electronic format. Such fees will be at the rate or rates for the classification of the employee(s) performing the search, as established in this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Computer searches.</E> We base the fees for computer searches on the actual cost to our agency of operating the computer and the salary of the operator.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Review fees.</E> (1) We charge review fees for time we spend examining documents that are responsive to a request to determine whether we must apply any FOIA exemptions to withhold information. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure), including redacting the record and marking the appropriate FOIA exemptions. We charge review fees even if we ultimately are unable to disclose a record.</P>
              <P>(2) We do not charge review fees for time we spend resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. However, we do charge review fees for time we spend obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Duplication fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">Photocopying standard-sized pages.</E> The current charge for photocopying records is $0.10 per page.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Reproduction of electronic records.</E> We will attempt to provide records in the format you sought, if the records are reasonably and readily reproducible in the requested format. We charge you for our direct costs for staff time and to organize, convert, and format data for release, per requester instructions, and for printouts or electronic media necessary to reproduce electronic records requested under the FOIA.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Copying other media.</E> We will charge you the direct cost of copying other media.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Mailing and special delivery fees.</E> We release records by United States Postal Service or, when appropriate, by electronic means, such as electronic mail or web portal. If a requester seeks special delivery, such as overnight shipping, we reserve the right to pass on the actual costs of special delivery to the requester. Requesters may provide their mailing account and billing information to the agency, so that they may pay directly for special delivery options.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Certification of records.</E> The FOIA does not require agencies to certify records as true copies. We may elect, as a matter of administrative discretion, <PRTPAGE P="32"/>to certify records upon request; however, such a request must be submitted in writing. Further, we will only certify as true copies records that have not left the agency's chain of custody. The charge for certification is $25.00 per record certified.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Other statutes specifically providing for fees.</E> The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an OpDiv or StaffDiv to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the OpDiv or StaffDiv must inform the requester of the contact information for that program.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 5.53</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How does HHS calculate FOIA fees for different categories of requesters?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If you are a commercial use requester, we charge you fees for searching, reviewing, and duplicating responsive records.</P>
              <P>(b) If you are an educational or noncommercial scientific institution requester, or a member of the news media, you are entitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media) without charge. We charge duplication fees after the first 100 pages (or its cost equivalent).</P>

              <P>(c) If you do not fall into either of the categories in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section (<E T="03">i.e.</E> you are an “other requester”), you are entitled to two hours of free search time, up to 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent of other media) without charge, and you will not be charged for review time. We may charge for search time beyond the first two hours and for duplication beyond the first 100 pages (or its cost equivalent).</P>
              <P>(d)(1) If we fail to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, we may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of the requester categories referenced in paragraph (b) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in (d)(2)-(4).</P>
              <P>(2) If we have determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and we provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.</P>
              <P>(3) If we have determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, we may charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (b) of this section, may charge duplication fees if the following steps are taken: we must have provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5. U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, we may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.</P>
              <P>(4) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 5.54</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How may I request a fee waiver?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
              <P>(b) We must furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when we determine, based on all available information, that the following three factors are satisfied:</P>
              <P>(1) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</P>

              <P>(2) Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute <PRTPAGE P="33"/>significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(i) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.</P>
              <P>(ii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. We will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.</P>
              <P>(3) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, we will consider the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) We will identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</P>
              <P>(ii) If there is an identified commercial interest, we will determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. We ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied factors (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.</P>
              <P>(c) You should ask for waiver or reduction of fees when you first submit your request to HHS, and should address the criteria referenced in this section.</P>

              <P>(a) We respond to your appeal within 20 working days after the appeal official designated in your appeal letter receives it. If, however, your appeal is based on a denial of a request for expedited processing, we will act on your appeal of that decision expeditiously. Before making a decision on an appeal of an adverse determination, the designated review official will consult with the Office of the General Counsel. Also, the concurrence of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs is required in all appeal decisions, including those on fees. When the review official responds to an appeal, that constitutes the Department's final action on the request.</P>
              <P>(b) If we reverse or modify the initial decision, we will inform you in writing and, if applicable, reprocess your request. If we do not change our initial decision, we will respond in writing to you, explain the reasons for the decision, set out any FOIA exemptions that apply, and inform you of the provisions for judicial review. If a requester files a FOIA lawsuit in reference to an appeal, we will cease processing the appeal.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Notification of or access to records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Times, places, and manner of requesting notification of or access to a record.</E> (1) Subject to the provisions governing medical records in § 5b.6 of this part, any individual may request notification of a record. He may at the same time request access to any record pertaining to him. An individual may be accompanied by another individual of his choice when he requests access to a record in person; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That he affirmatively authorizes the presence of such other individual during any discussion of a record to which access is requested.</P>
            <P>(2) An individual making a request for notification of or access to a record shall address his request to the responsible Department official and shall verify his identity when required in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. At the time the request is made, the individual shall specify which systems of records he wishes to have searched and the records to which he wishes to have access. He may also request that copies be made of all or any such records. An individual shall also provide the responsible Department official with sufficient particulars to enable such official to distinguish between records on subject individuals with the same name. The necessary particulars are set forth in the notices of systems of records.</P>

            <P>(3) An individual who makes a request in person may leave with any responsible Department official a request for notification of or access to a record under the control of another responsible Department official; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the request is addressed in writing to the appropriate responsible Department official.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Verification of identity</E>—(1) <E T="03">When required.</E> Unless an individual, who is making a request for notification of or access to a record in person, is personally known to the responsible Department official, he shall be required to verify his identity in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section if:</P>
            <P>(i) He makes a request for notification of a record and the responsible Department official determines that the mere disclosure of the existence of the record would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy if disclosed to someone other than the subject individual; or,</P>
            <P>(ii) He makes a request for access to a record which is not required to be disclosed to the general public under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and part 5 of this title.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Manner of verifying identity.</E> (i) An individual who makes a request in person shall provide to the responsible Department official at least one piece of tangible identification such as a driver's license, passport, alien or voter registration card, or union card to verify his identity. If an individual does not have identification papers to verify his identity, he shall certify in writing that he is the individual who he claims to be and that he understands that the knowing and willful request for or acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Act subject to a $5,000 fine.</P>

            <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, an individual <PRTPAGE P="38"/>who does not make a request in person shall submit a notarized request to the responsible Department official to verify his identity or shall certify in his request that he is the individual who he claims to be and that he understands that the knowing and willful request for or acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Act subject to a $5,000 fine.</P>

            <P>(iii) An individual who makes a request on behalf of a minor or legal incompetent as authorized under § 5b.10 of this part shall verify his relationship to the minor or legal incompetent, in addition to verifying his own identity, by providing a copy of the minor's birth certificate, a court order, or other competent evidence of guardianship to the responsible Department official; <E T="03">except that,</E> an individual is not required to verify his relationship to the minor or legal incompetent when he is not required to verify his own identity or when evidence of his relationship to the minor or legal incompetent has been previously given to the responsible Department official.</P>
            <P>(iv) An individual shall further verify his identity if he is requesting notification of or access to sensitive records such as medical records. Any further verification shall parallel the record to which notification or access is being sought. Such further verification may include such particulars as the individual's years of attendance at a particular educational institution, rank attained in the uniformed services, date or place of birth, names of parents, an occupation or the specific times the individual received medical treatment.</P>
            <P>(v) An individual who makes a request by telephone shall verify his identity by providing to the responsible Department official identifying particulars which parallel the record to which notification or access is being sought. If the responsible Department official determines that the particulars provided by telephone are insufficient, the requester will be required to submit the request in writing or in person. Telephone requests will not be accepted where an individual is requesting notification of or access to sensitive records such as medical records.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Granting notification of or access to a record.</E> (1) Subject to the provisions governing medical records in § 5b.6 of this part and the provisions governing exempt systems in § 5b.11 of this part, a responsible Department official, who receives a request for notification of or access to a record and, if required, verification of an individual's identity, will review the request and grant notification or access to a record, if the individual requesting access to the record is the subject individual.</P>
            <P>(2) If the responsible Department official determines that there will be a delay in responding to a request because of the number of requests being processed, a breakdown of equipment, shortage of personnel, storage of records in other locations, etc., he will so inform the individual and indicate when notification or access will be granted.</P>
            <P>(3) Prior to granting notification of or access to a record, the responsible Department official may at his discretion require an individual making a request in person to reduce his request to writing if the individual has not already done so at the time the request is made.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Special procedures for notification of or access to medical records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> An individual in general has a right to notification of or access to his medical records, including psychological records, as well as to other records pertaining to him maintained by the Department. This section sets forth special procedures as permitted by the Act for notification of or access to medical records, including a special procedure for notification of or access to medical records of minors. The special procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section may not be suitable for use by every component of the Department. Therefore, components may follow the paragraph (b) procedure for notification of or access to medical records, or may issue regulations establishing special procedures for such purposes. The special procedure set forth in paragraph (c) of this section relating to medical records of minors is mandatory.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Medical records procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notification of or access to medical records.</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="39"/>(i) Any individual may request notification of or access to a medical record pertaining to him. Unless the individual is a parent or guardian requesting notification of or access to a minor's medical record, an individual shall make a request for a medical record in accordance with this section and the procedures in § 5b.5 of this part.</P>
            <P>(ii) An individual who requests notification of or access to a medical record shall, at the time the request is made, designate a representative in writing. The representative may be a physician, other health professional, or other responsible individual, who would be willing to review the record and inform the subject individual of its contents at the representative's discretion.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Utilization of the designated representative.</E> A subject individual will be granted direct access to a medical record if the responsible official determines that direct access is not likely to have an adverse effect on the subject individual. If the responsible Department official believes that he is not qualified to determine, or if he does determine, that direct access to the subject individual is likely to have an adverse effect on the subject individual, the record will be sent to the designated representative. The subject individual will be informed in writing that the record has been sent.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Medical records of minors</E>—(1) <E T="03">Requests by minors; notification of or access to medical records to minors.</E> A minor may request notification of or access to a medical record pertaining to him in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Requests on a minor's behalf; notification of or access to medical records to an individual on a minor's behalf.</E> (i) In order to protect the privacy of a minor, a parent or guardian, authorized to act on a minor's behalf as provided in § 5b.10 of this part, who makes a request for notification of or access to a minor's medical record will not be given direct notification of or access to such record.</P>
            <P>(ii) A parent or guardian shall make all requests for notification of or access to a minor's medical record in accordance with this paragraph and the procedures in § 5b.5 of this part. A parent or guardian shall at the time he makes a request designate a family physician or other health professional (other than a family member) to whom the record, if any, will be sent.</P>

            <P>(iii) Where a medical record on the minor exists, it will be sent to the physician or health professional designated by the parent or guardian in all cases. If disclosure of the record would constitute an invasion of the minor's privacy, that fact will be brought to the attention of the physician or health professional to whom the record is sent. The physician or health professional will be asked to consider the effect that disclosure of the record to the parent or guardian would have on the minor in determining whether the minor's medical record should be made available to the parent or guardian. Response to the parent or guardian making the request will be made in substantially the following form:

            <P>In addition, employees shall disclose records which are listed in the Department's Freedom of Information Regulation as being available to the public.

This does not preclude employees from discussing matters which are known to them personally, and without resort to a record, to official investigators of Federal agencies for official purposes such as suitability checks, Equal Employment Opportunity investigations, adverse action proceedings, grievance proceedings, etc.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Rules governing employees whose duties require use or reference to systems of records.</E> Employees whose official duties require that they refer to, maintain, service, or otherwise deal with systems of records (hereinafter referred to as “Systems Employees”) are governed by the general provisions.

If a determination is made that the operation of the system is to accomplish a Department function, the contracting officer shall be responsible for including in the contract appropriate provisions to apply the <PRTPAGE P="47"/>provisions of the Act and regulation to the system, including prohibitions against improper release by the contractor, his employees, agents, or subcontractors.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Other service contracts.</E> Contracting officers entering into general service contracts shall be responsible for determining the appropriateness of including provisions in the contract to prevent potential misuse (inadvertent or otherwise) by employees, agents, or subcontractors of the contractor.</P>

A person shall not be considered to be a part-time employee or part-time consultant for this purpose unless the terms of his employment contemplate that he shall work for less than the minimum number of hours per day, or less than a minimum number of days per week, or less than the minimum number of weeks per year, regularly required of full-time employees of his class.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Determination as to domestic rights.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The determination of the ownership of the domestic right, title, and interest in and to an invention which is or may be patentable, made by a Government employee while under the administrative jurisdiction of the Department, shall be made in writing by the Assistant Secretary (Health and Scientific Affairs), in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 10096 and Government-wide regulations issued thereunder by the Commissioner of Patents as follows:</P>
            <P>(a) The Government as represented by the Assistant Secretary (Health and Scientific Affairs) shall obtain the entire domestic right, title and interest in and to all inventions made by any Government employee (1) during working hours, or (2) with a contribution by the Government of facilities, equipment, materials, funds, or information, or of time or services of other Government employees on official duty, or (3) which bear a direct relation to or are made in consequence of the official duties of the inventor.</P>

            <P>(b) In any case where the contribution of the Government, as measured by any one or more of the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, <PRTPAGE P="49"/>to the invention is insufficient equitably to justify a requirement of assignment to the Government of the entire domestic right, title and interest in and to such invention, or in any case where the Government has insufficient interest in an invention to obtain the entire domestic right, title, and interest therein (although the Government could obtain same under paragraph (a) of this section), the Department, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, shall leave title to such invention in the employee, subject, however, to the reservation to the Government of a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention with power to grant licenses for all governmental purposes, such reservation to appear, where practicable, in any patent, domestic or foreign, which may issue on such invention.</P>
            <P>(c) In applying the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, to the facts and circumstances relating to the making of any particular invention, it shall be presumed that an invention made by an employee who is employed or assigned (1) to invent or improve or perfect any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, (2) to conduct or perform research, development work, or both, (3) to supervise, direct, coordinate, or review Government financed or conducted research, development work, or both, or (4) to act in a liaison capacity among governmental or nongovernmental agencies or individuals engaged in such work, falls within the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, and it shall be presumed that any invention made by any other employee falls within the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. Either presumption may be rebutted by a showing of the facts and circumstances and shall not preclude a determination that these facts and circumstances justify leaving the entire right, title and interest in and to the invention in the Government employee, subject to law.</P>
            <P>(d) In any case wherein the Government neither (1) obtains the entire domestic right, title and interest in and to an invention pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, nor (2) reserves a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention, with power to grant licenses for all governmental purposes, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the Government shall leave the entire right, title and interest in and to the invention in the Government employee, subject to law.</P>

In case where the inventor is not required to assign the patent rights in any foreign country or countries to the Government or the Government fails to exercise its option within such period of time as may be provided by regulations issued by the Commissioner of Patents, any application for a patent which may be filed in such country or countries by the inventor or his assignee shall nevertheless be subject to a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to the Government for all governmental purposes, including the power to issue sublicenses for use in behalf of the Government and/or in furtherance of the foreign policies of the Government.</P>

            <P>It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services in accordance with the policy of the President announced on February 21, 1969, to make research and study facilities of the Department readily available to the scientific community, especially qualified academic scientists and engineers. Unique, unusual, and expensive-to-duplicate facilities at laboratories and other study and research facilities of the Department will be made available to the national scientific community, to the maximum extent practical without serious detriment to the missions of those facilities. It is also the policy of the Department to permit qualified students and graduates of institutions of learning in the several States, and territories, as well as the District of Columbia, to use study and research facilities of the Department. When such facilities are used by academic scientists, engineers, and students, the costs incurred for the operation of the unique or unusual research facilities, as well as of the other facilities, should be funded by the operating agency responsible for the operation of that facility, except for any significant incremental costs incurred in support of research not directly related to an HHS mission.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Criteria.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The official permitting use of Department facilities must determine that it would be consistent with the programs of his activity to participate. Facilities may be made available provided the use of such facilities will be of direct benefit to the objectives of the academic scientist, or engineer, or student, with the prospect of fruitful interchange of ideas and information between Department personnel and the academic scientist, or engineer, or student, and such use will not interfere with the Department program.</P>
            <P>(b) The official permitting use of Department facilities will furnish the non-Government user with safety requirements or operating procedures to be followed. Such requirements or procedures are to include the requirement to report to the permitting official any accident involving the non-Government user.</P>

            <P>(c) The official delegated authority for approving the use of Department facilities will not permit the use of laboratory facilities unless he determines:<PRTPAGE P="51"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) That facilities are available for the period desired; and</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 9.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Restrictions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Each individual authorized to use Department facilities will be expected to use the facilities and equipment with customary care and otherwise conduct himself in such manner as to complete his research or study within any time limits prescribed.</P>
            <P>(b) Each individual authorized to use HHS facilities may not be authorized to sign requisitions for supplies and equipment.</P>
            <P>(c) Any official approving the use of HHS facilities should seek an agreement, executed by non-Government users, absolving the Federal agency of liability in case of personal injury, death, and failure or damage to the non-Government user's experiments or equipment. The agreement must also contain a statement that the non-Government user will comply with all safety regulations and procedures while using such facilities.</P>

            <P>This part is applicable to surplus real property located within any State which is appropriate for assignment to, or which has been assigned to, the Department for transfer for public health purposes, as provided for in section 203(k) of the Act.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General policies.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) It is the policy of the Department to foster and assure maximum utilization of surplus real property for public health purposes, including research.</P>
            <P>(b) Transfers may be made only to States, their political subdivisions and instrumentalities, tax-supported public health institutions, and nonprofit public health institutions which (except for institutions which lease property to assist the homeless under Title V of Pub. L. 100-77) have been held tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</P>
            <P>(c) Real property will be requested for assignment only when the Department has determined that the property is suitable and needed for public health purposes. The amount of real and related personal property to be transferred shall not exceed normal operating requirements of the applicant. Such property will not be requested for assignment unless it is needed at the time of application for public health purposes or will be so needed within the immediate or foreseeable future. Where construction or major renovation is not required or proposed, the property must be placed into use within twelve (12) months from the date of transfer. When construction or major renovation is contemplated at the time of transfer, the property must be placed in use within 36 months from the date of transfer. If the applicable time limitation is not met, the transferee shall either commence payments in cash to the Department for each month thereafter during which the proposed use has not been implemented or take such other action as set forth in § 12.12 as is deemed appropriate by the Department. Such monthly payments shall be computed on the basis of the current fair market value of the property at the time of the first payment by subtracting therefrom any portion of the purchase price paid in cash at the time of transfer, and by dividing the balance by the total number of months in the period of restriction. If the facility has not been placed into use within eight (8) years of the date of the deed, title to the property will be revested in the United States, or, at the discretion of the Department, the restrictions and conditions may be abrogated in accordance with § 12.9.</P>

            <P>(d) Transfers will be made only after the applicant has certified that the proposed program is not in conflict <PRTPAGE P="53"/>with State or local zoning restrictions, building codes, or similar limitations.</P>
            <P>(e) Organizations which may be eligible include those which provide care and training for the physically and mentally ill, including medical care of the aged and infirm; clinical services; services (including shelter) to homeless individuals; other public health services (including water and sewer); or similar services devoted primarily to the promotion and protection of public health. In addition, organizations which provide assistance to homeless individuals may be eligible for leases under title V of Public Law 100-77. Except for the provision of services (including shelter) to homeless individuals, organizations which have as their principal purpose the providing of custodial or domiciliary care are not eligible. The eligible organization must be authorized to carry out the activity for which it requests the property.</P>
            <P>(f) An applicant's plan of operation will not be approved unless it provides that the applicant will not discriminate because of race, color, sex, handicap, or national origin in the use of the property.</P>

            <P>(a) Surplus real property transfers under this part will be limited to public health purposes. Transferees shall <PRTPAGE P="54"/>be entitled to a public benefit allowance in terms of a percentage which will be applied against the value of the property to be conveyed. Such an allowance will be computed on the basis of benefits to the United States from the use of such property for public health purposes. The computation of such public benefit allowances will be in accordance with Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof.</P>
            <P>(b) A transfer of surplus real property for public health purposes is subject to the disapproval of the Administrator within 30 days after notice is given to him of the proposed transfer.</P>
            <P>(c) Transfers will be on the following terms and conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) The transferee will be obligated to utilize the property continuously in accordance with an approved plan of operation.</P>
            <P>(2) The transferee will not be permitted to sell, lease or sublease, rent, mortgage, encumber, or otherwise dispose of the property, or any part thereof, without the prior written authorization of the Department.</P>
            <P>(3) The transferee will file with the Department such reports covering the utilization of the property as may be required.</P>
            <P>(4) In the event the property is sold, leased or subleased, encumbered, disposed of, or is used for purposes other than those set forth in the approved plan without the consent of the Department, all revenues or the reasonable value of other benefits received by the transferee directly or indirectly from such use, as determined by the Department, will be considered to have been received and held in trust by the transferee for the account of the United States and will be subject to the direction and control of the Department. The provisions of this paragraph shall not impair or affect the rights reserved to the United States in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, or the right of the Department to impose conditions to its consent.</P>
            <P>(5) Lessees will be required to carry all perils and liability insurance to protect the Government and the Government's residual interest in the property. Transferees will be required to carry such flood insurance as may be required by the Department pursuant to Pub. L. 93-234. Where the transferee elects to carry insurance against damages to or loss of on-site property due to fire or other hazards, and where loss or damage to transferred Federal surplus real property occurs, all proceeds from insurance shall be promptly used by the transferee for the purpose of repairing and restoring the property to its former condition, or replacing it with equivalent or more suitable facilities. If not so used, there shall be paid to the United States that part of the insurance proceeds that is attributable to the Government's residual interest in the property lost, damaged, or destroyed in the case of leases, attributable to the fair market value of the leased facilities.</P>
            <P>(6) With respect to on-site property, in the event of noncompliance with any of the conditions of the transfer as determined by the Department, title to the property transferred and the right to immediate possession shall, at the option of the Department, revert to the Government. In the event title is reverted to the United States for noncompliance or voluntarily reconveyed, the transferee shall, at the option of the Department, be required to reimburse the Government for the decrease in value of the property not due to reasonable wear and tear or acts of God or attributable to alterations completed by the transferee to adapt the property to the public health use for which the property was transferred. With respect to leased property, in the event of noncompliance with any of the conditions of the lease, as determined by the Department, the right of occupancy and possession shall, at the option of the Department, be terminated. In the event a leasehold is terminated by the United States for noncompliance or is voluntarily surrendered, the lessee shall be required at the option of the Department to reimburse the Government for the decrease in value of the property not due to reasonable wear and tear or acts of God or attributable to alterations completed by the lessee to adapt the property to the public health use for which the property was leased.</P>

            <FP>With respect to any reverter of title or termination of leasehold resulting from noncompliance, the Government <PRTPAGE P="55"/>shall, in addition thereto, be reimbursed for such costs as may be incurred in recovering title to or possession of the property.</FP>
            
            <FP>Any payments of cash made by the transferee against the purchase price of property transferred shall, upon a forfeiture of title to the property for breach of condition, be forfeited.</FP>
            <P>(7) With respect to off-site property, in the event of noncompliance with any of the terms and conditions of the transfer, the unearned public benefit allowance shall, at the option of the Department, become immediately due and payable or, if the property or any portion thereof is sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of without authorization from the Department, such sale, lease or sublease, or other disposal shall be for the benefit and account of the United States and the United States shall be entitled to the proceeds. In the event the transferee fails to remove the property or any portion thereof within the time specified, then in addition to the rights reserved above, at the option of the Department, all right, title, and interest in and to such unremoved property shall be retransferred to other eligible applicants or shall be forfeited to the United States.</P>
            <P>(8) With respect only to on-site property which has been declared excess by the Department of Defense, such declaration having included a statement indicating the property has a known potential for use during a national emergency, the Department shall reserve the right during any period of emergency declared by the President of the United States or by the Congress of the United States to the full and unrestricted use by the Government of the surplus real property, or of any portion thereof, disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this part. Such use may be either exclusive or nonexclusive. Prior to the expiration or termination of the period of restricted use by the transferee, the Government will not be obligated to pay rent or any other fees or charges during the period of emergency, except that the Government will:</P>
            <P>(i) Bear the entire cost of maintenance of such portion of the property used by it exclusively or over which it may have exclusive possession or control;</P>
            <P>(ii) Pay the fair share, commensurate with the use of the cost of maintenance of such surplus real property as it may use nonexclusively or over which it may have nonexclusive possession or control;</P>
            <P>(iii) Pay a fair rental for the use of improvements or additions to the surplus real property made by the purchaser or lessee without Government aid; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Be responsible for any damage to the surplus real property caused by its use, reasonable wear and tear, the common enemy and acts of God excepted. Subsequent to the expiration or termination of the period of restricted use, the obligations of the Government will be as set forth in the preceding sentence and, in addition, the Government shall be obligated to pay a fair rental for all or any portion of the conveyed premises which it uses.</P>
            <P>(9) The restrictions set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) through (7) of this section will extend for thirty (30) years for land with or without improvements; and for facilities being acquired separately from land whether they are for use on-site or off-site, the period of limitations on the use of the structures will be equal to their estimated economic life. The restrictions set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) through (7) of this section will extend for the entire initial lease period and for any renewal periods for property leased from the Department.</P>

            <P>(d) Transferees, by obtaining the consent of the Department, may abrogate the restrictions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section for all or any portion of the property upon payment in cash to the Department of an amount equal to the then current fair market value of the property to be released, multiplied by the public benefit allowance granted at the time of conveyance, divided by the total number of months of the period of restriction set forth in the conveyance document and multiplied by the number of months that remain in the period of restriction as determined by the Department. For purposes of abrogation payment computation, the current fair market value <PRTPAGE P="56"/>shall not include the value of any improvements placed on the property by the transferee.</P>
            <P>(e) Related personal property will be transferred or leased as a part of the realty and in accordance with real property procedures. It will be subject to the same public benefit allowance granted for the real property. Where related personal property is involved in an on-site transfer, the related personal property may be transferred by a bill of sale imposing restrictions for a period not to exceed five years from the date of transfer, other terms and conditions to be the same as, and made a part of, the real property transaction.</P>

            <P>(a) The Department will, prior to making a final decision to convey or lease, or to amend, reform, or grant an approval or release with respect to a previous conveyance or lease of, surplus real property for public health purposes, complete an environmental assessment of the proposed transaction in keeping with applicable provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the National Archeological Data Preservation Act, and other related acts. No permit to use surplus real property shall allow the permittee to make, or cause to be made, any irreversible change in the condition of said property, and no use permit shall be employed for the purpose of delaying or avoiding compliance with the requirements of these Acts.</P>
            <P>(b) Applicants shall be required to provide such information as the Department deems necessary to make an assessment of the impact of the proposed Federal action on the human environment. Materials contained in the applicant's official request, responses to a standard questionnaire prescribed by the Public Health Service, as well as other relevant information, will be used by the Department in making said assessment.</P>
            <P>(c) If the assessment reveals (1) That the proposed Federal action involves properties of historical significance which are listed, or eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic Places, or (2) that a more than insignificant impact on the human environment is reasonably foreseeable as a result of the proposed action, or (3) that the proposed Federal action could result in irreparable loss or destruction of archeologically significant items or data, the Department will, except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section, prepare and distribute, or cause to be prepared or distributed, such notices and statements and obtain such approvals as are required by the above cited Acts.</P>
            <P>(d) If a proposed action involves other Federal agencies in a sequence of actions, or a group of actions, directly related to each other because of their functional interdependence, the Department may enter into and support a lead agency agreement to designate a single lead agency which will assume primary responsibility for coordinating the assessment of environmental effects of proposed Federal actions, preparing and distributing such notices and statements, or obtaining such approvals, as are required by the above cited Acts. The procedures of the designated lead agency will be utilized in conducting the environmental assessment. In the event of disagreement between the Department and another Federal agency, the Department will reserve the right to abrogate its lead agency agreement with the other Federal Agency.</P>

The applicant will be required to assume, or obtain release of, the Government's obligations respecting the land including but not limited to obligations relating to restoration, waste, and rent.

            <SUBJECT>Collecting the information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Canvass of landholding agencies.</E> On a quarterly basis, HUD will canvass landholding agencies to collect information about property described as unutilized, underutilized, excess, or surplus, in surveys conducted by the agencies under section 202 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (40 U.S.C. 483), Executive Order 12512, and 41 CFR part 101-47.800. Each canvass will collect information on properties not previously reported and about property reported previously the status or classification of which has changed or for which any of the information reported on the property checklist has changed.</P>
            <P>(1) HUD will request descriptive information on properties sufficient to make a reasonable determination, under the criteria described below, of the suitability of a property for use as a facility to assist the homeless.</P>
            <P>(2) HUD will direct landholding agencies to respond to requests for information within 25 days of receipt of such requests.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency Annual Report.</E> By December 31 of each year, each landholding agency must notify HUD regarding the current availability status and classification of each property controlled by the agency that:</P>
            <P>(1) Was included in a list of suitable properties published that year by HUD, and</P>
            <P>(2) Remains available for application for use to assist the homeless, or has become available for application during that year.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">GSA Inventory.</E> HUD will collect information, in the same manner as described in paragraph (a) of this section, from GSA regarding property that is in GSA's current inventory of excess or surplus property.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Suitability determination.</E> Within 30 days after the receipt of information from landholding agencies regarding properties which were reported pursuant to the canvass described in § 12a.3(a), HUD will determine, under criteria set forth in § 12a.6, which properties are suitable for use as facilities to assist the homeless and report its determination to the landholding agency. Properties that are under lease, contract, license, or agreement by which a Federal agency retains a real property interest or which are scheduled to become unutilized or underutilized will be reviewed for suitability no earlier than six months prior to the expected date when the property will become unutilized or underutilized, except that properties subject to the Base Closure and Realignment Act may be reviewed up to eighteen months prior to the expected date when the property will become unutilized or underutilized.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope of suitability.</E> HUD will determine the suitability of a property for use as a facility to assist the homeless without regard to any particular use.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Environmental information.</E> HUD will evaluate the environmental information contained in property checklists forwarded to HUD by the landholding agencies solely for the purpose of determining suitability of properties under the criteria in § 12a.6.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Written record of suitability determination.</E> HUD will assign an identification number to each property reviewed for suitability. HUD will maintain a written public record of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The suitability determination for a particular piece of property, and the reasons for that determination; and</P>
            <P>(2) The landholding agency's response to the determination pursuant to the requirements of § 12a.7(a).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Property determined unsuitable.</E> Property that is reviewed by HUD under this section and that is determined unsuitable for use to assist the homeless may not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of a Notice of unsuitability to allow for review of the determination at the request of a representative of the homeless.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Procedures for appealing unsuitability determinations.</E> (1) To request review of a determination of unsuitability, a representative of the homeless must contact HUD within 20 days of publication of notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that a property is unsuitable. Requests may be submitted to HUD in writing or by calling 1-800-927-7588 (Toll Free). Written requests must be received no later than 20 days after notice of unsuitability is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Requests for review of a determination of unsuitability may be made only by representatives of the homeless, as defined in § 12a.1.</P>
            <P>(3) The request for review must specify the grounds on which it is based, i.e., that HUD has improperly applied the criteria or that HUD has relied on incorrect or incomplete information in making the determination (e.g., that property is in a floodplain but not in a floodway).</P>
            <P>(4) Upon receipt of a request to review a determination of unsuitability, HUD will notify the landholding agency that such a request has been made, request that the agency respond with any information pertinent to the review, and advise the agency that it should refrain from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has completed its reconsideration regarding unsuitability.</P>
            <P>(i) HUD will act on all requests for review within 30 days of receipt of the landholding agency's response and will notify the representative of the homeless and the landholding agency in writing of its decision.</P>

            <P>(ii) If a property is determined suitable as a result of the review, HUD will <PRTPAGE P="62"/>request the landholding agency's determination of availability pursuant to § 12a.7(a), upon receipt of which HUD will promptly publish the determination in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> If the determination of unsuitability stands, HUD will inform the representative of the homeless of its decision.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Real property reported excess to GSA.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Each landholding agency must submit a report to GSA of properties it determines excess. Each landholding agency must also provide a copy of HUD's suitability determination, if any, including HUD's identification number for the property.</P>
            <P>(b) If a landholding agency reports a property to GSA which has been reviewed by HUD for homeless assistance suitability and HUD determined the property suitable, GSA will screen the property pursuant to § 12a.5(g) and will advise HUD of the availability of the property for use by the homeless as provided in § 12a.5(e). In lieu of the above, GSA may submit a new checklist to HUD and follow the procedures in § 12a.5(c) through § 12a.5(g).</P>
            <P>(c) If a landholding agency reports a property to GSA which has not been reviewed by HUD for homeless assistance suitability, GSA will complete a property checklist, based on information provided by the landholding agency, and will forward this checklist to HUD for a suitability determination. This checklist will reflect any change in classification, i.e., from unutilized or underutilized to excess.</P>
            <P>(d) Within 30 days after GSA's submission, HUD will advise GSA of the suitability determination.</P>
            <P>(e) When GSA receives a letter from HUD listing suitable excess properties in GSA's inventory, GSA will transmit to HUD within 45 days a response which includes the following for each identified property:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement that there is no other compelling Federal need for the property, and therefore, the property will be determined surplus; or</P>
            <P>(2) A statement that there is further and compelling Federal need for the property (including a full explanation of such need) and that, therefore, the property is not presently available for use to assist the homeless.</P>

            <P>(f) When an excess property is determined suitable and available and notice is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> GSA will concurrently notify HHS, HUD, State and local government units, known homeless assistance providers that have expressed interest in the particular property, and other organizations, as appropriate, concerning suitable properties.</P>
            <P>(g) Upon submission of a Report of Excess to GSA, GSA may screen the property for Federal use. In addition, GSA may screen State and local governmental units and eligible nonprofit organizations to determine interest in the property in accordance with current regulations. (See 41 CFR 101-47.203-5, 101-47.204-1 and 101-47.303-2.)</P>
            <P>(h) The landholding agency will retain custody and accountability and will protect and maintain any property which is reported excess to GSA as provided in 41 CFR 101-47.402.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Suitability criteria.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) All properties, buildings and land will be determined suitable unless a property's characteristics include one or more of the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">National security concerns.</E> A property located in an area to which the general public is denied access in the interest of national security (e.g., where a special pass or security clearance is a condition of entry to the property) will be determined unsuitable. Where alternative access can be provided for the public without compromising national security, the property will not be determined unsuitable on this basis.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Property containing flammable or explosive materials.</E> A property located within 2000 feet of an industrial, commercial or Federal facility handling flammable or explosive material (excluding underground storage) will be determined unsuitable. Above ground containers with a capacity of 100 gallons or less, or larger containers which provide the heating or power source for the property, and which meet local safety, operation, and permitting standards, will not affect whether a <PRTPAGE P="63"/>particular property is determined suitable or unsuitable. Underground storage, gasoline stations and tank trucks are not included in this category and their presence will not be the basis of an unsuitability determination unless there is evidence of a threat to personal safety as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Runway clear zone and military airfield clear zone.</E> A property located within an airport runway clear zone or military airfield clear zone will be determined unsuitable.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Floodway.</E> A property located in the floodway of a 100 year floodplain will be determined unsuitable. If the floodway has been contained or corrected, or if only an incidental portion of the property not affecting the use of the remainder of the property is in the floodway, the property will not be determined unsuitable.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Documented deficiencies.</E> A property with a documented and extensive condition(s) that represents a clear threat to personal physical safety will be determined unsuitable. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, contamination, structural damage or extensive deterioration, friable asbestos, PCB's, or natural hazardous substances such as radon, periodic flooding, sinkholes or earth slides.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Inaccessible.</E> A property that is inaccessible will be determined unsuitable. An inaccessible property is one that is not accessible by road (including property on small off-shore islands) or is land locked (e.g., can be reached only by crossing private property and there is no established right or means of entry).</P>

            <P>(2) In the case of excess property which had previously been reported to GSA:</P>
            <P>(i) A statement that there is no compelling Federal need for the property, and that, therefore, the property will be determined surplus; or</P>

Any representative of the homeless interested in any underutilized, unutilized, excess or surplus Federal property for use as a facility to assist the homeless must send to HHS a written expression of interest in that property within 60 days after the property has been published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) If a written expression of interest to apply for suitable property for use to assist the homeless is received by HHS within the 60 day holding period, such property may not be made available for any other purpose until the date HHS or the appropriate landholding agency has completed action on the application submitted pursuant to that expression of interest.</P>

            <P>(3) The expression of interest should identify the specific property, briefly describe the proposed use, include the name of the organization, and indicate whether it is a public body or a private non-profit organization. The expression of interest must be sent to the Division of Health Facilities Planning (DHFP) of the Department of Health and Human Services at the following address:

            </EXTRACT>
            
            <FP>HHS will notify the landholding agency (for unutilized and underutilized properties) or GSA (for excess and surplus properties) when an expression of interest has been received for a particular property.</FP>
            <P>(4) An expression of interest may be sent to HHS any time after the 60 day holding period has expired. In such a case, an application submitted pursuant to this expression of interest may be approved for use by the homeless if:</P>
            <P>(i) No application or written expression of interest has been made under any law for use of the property for any purpose; and</P>
            <P>(ii) In the case of excess or surplus property, GSA has not received a bona fide offer to purchase that property or advertised for the sale of the property by public auction.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Application Requirements.</E> Upon receipt of an expression of interest, DHFP will send an application packet to the interested entity. The application packet requires the applicant to provide certain information, including the following—</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Description of the applicant organization.</E> The applicant must document that it satisfies the definition of a “representative of the homeless,” as specified in § 12a.1 of this subpart. The applicant must document its authority to hold real property. Private non-profit organizations applying for deeds must document that they are section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Description of the property desired.</E> The applicant must describe the property desired and indicate that any modifications made to the property will conform to local use restrictions except for local zoning regulations.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Description of the proposed program.</E> The applicant must fully describe the proposed program and demonstrate how the program will address the needs of the homeless population to be assisted. The applicant must fully describe what modifications will be made to the property before the program becomes operational.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Ability to finance and operate the proposed program.</E> The applicant must specifically describe all anticipated costs and sources of funding for the proposed program. The applicant must indicate that it can assume care, custody, and maintenance of the property and that it has the necessary funds or the ability to obtain such funds to carry out the approved program of use for the property.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Compliance with non-discrimination requirements.</E> Each applicant and lessee under this part must certify in writing that it will comply with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act (42 <PRTPAGE P="65"/>U.S.C. 3601-3619) and implementing regulations; and as applicable, Executive Order 11063 (Equal Opportunity in Housing) and implementing regulations; title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d to d-4) (Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs) and implementing regulations; the prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of age under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107) and implementing regulations; and the prohibitions against otherwise qualified individuals with handicaps under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations. The applicant must state that it will not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, familial status, or handicap in the use of the property, and will maintain the required records to demonstrate compliance with Federal laws.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Insurance.</E> The applicant must certify that it will insure the property against loss, damage, or destruction in accordance with the requirements of 45 CFR 12.9.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Historic preservation.</E> Where applicable, the applicant must provide information that will enable HHS to comply with Federal historic preservation requirements.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Environmental information.</E> The applicant must provide sufficient information to allow HHS to analyze the potential impact of the applicant's proposal on the environment, in accordance with the instructions provided with the application packet.

            <P>(9) <E T="03">Local government notification.</E> The applicant must indicate that it has informed the applicable unit of general local government responsible for providing sewer, water, police, and fire services, in writing of its proposed program.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Zoning and Local Use Restrictions.</E> The applicant must indicate that it will comply with all local use restrictions, including local building code requirements. Any applicant which applies for a lease or permit for a particular property is not required to comply with local zoning requirements.

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope of evaluations.</E> Due to the short time frame imposed for evaluating applications, HHS' evaluation will, generally, be limited to the information contained in the application.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Deadline.</E> Completed applications must be received by DHFP, at the above address, within 90 days after an expression of interest is received from a particular applicant for that property. Upon written request from the applicant, HHS may grant extensions, provided that the appropriate landholding agency concurs with the extension. Because each applicant will have a different deadline based on the date the applicant submitted an expression of interest, applicants should contact the individual landholding agency to confirm that a particular property remains available prior to submitting an application.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Evaluations.</E> (1) Upon receipt of an application, HHS will review it for completeness, and, if incomplete, may return it or ask the applicant to furnish any missing or additional required information prior to final evaluation of the application.</P>
            <P>(2) HHS will evaluate each completed application within 25 days of receipt and will promptly advise the applicant of its decision. Applications are evaluated on a first-come, first-serve basis. HHS will notify all organizations which have submitted expressions of interest for a particular property regarding whether the first application received for that property has been approved or disapproved. All applications will be reviewed on the basis of the following elements, which are listed in descending order of priority, except that paragraphs (e)(2)(iv) and (e)(2)(v) of this section are of equal importance.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Services offered.</E> The extent and range of proposed services, such as meals, shelter, job training, and counseling.</P>

            <P>(3) Additional evaluation factors may be added as deemed necessary by HHS. If additional factors are added, the application packet will be revised to include a description of these additional factors.</P>
            <P>(4) If HHS receives one or more competing applications for a property within 5 days of the first application HHS will evaluate all completed applications simultaneously. HHS will rank approved applications based on the elements listed in § 12a.8(e)(2), and notify the landholding agency, or GSA, as appropriate, of the relative ranks.</P>

The landholding agency will execute the lease, or permit document, as appropriate, in consultation with the applicant.</P>
            <P>(2) The landholding agency maintains the discretion to decide the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The length of time the property will be available. (Leases and permits will be for a period of at least one year unless the applicant requests a shorter term.)</P>
            <P>(ii) Whether to grant use of the property via a lease or permit;</P>
            <P>(iii) The terms and conditions of the lease or permit document.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Excess and surplus properties.</E> (1) When HHS approves an application, it will so notify the applicant and request that GSA assign the property to HHS for leasing. Upon receipt of the assignment, HHS will execute a lease in accordance with the procedures and requirements set out in 45 CFR part 12. In accordance with 41 CFR 101-47.402, custody and accountability of the property will remain throughout the lease term with the agency which initially reported the property as excess.</P>
            <P>(2) Prior to assignment to HHS, GSA may consider other Federal uses and other important national needs; however, in deciding the disposition of surplus real property, GSA will generally give priority of consideration to uses to assist the homeless. GSA may consider any competing request for the property made under section 203(k) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(k)) that is so meritorious and compelling that it outweighs the needs of the homeless, and HHS may likewise consider any competing request made under subsection 203(k)(1) of that law.</P>
            <P>(3) Whenever GSA or HHS decides in favor of a competing request over a request for property for homeless assistance use as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the agency making the decision will transmit to the appropriate committees of the Congress an explanatory statement which details the need satisfied by conveyance of the surplus property, and the reasons for determining that such need was so meritorious and compelling as to outweigh the needs of the homeless.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Deeds.</E> Surplus property may be conveyed to representatives of the homeless pursuant to section 203(k) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(k)(1), and section 501(f) of the McKinney Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. 11411. Representatives of the homeless must complete the application packet pursuant to the requirements of § 12a.9 of this part and in accordance with the requirements of 45 CFR part 12.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Completion of Lease Term and Reversion of Title.</E> Lessees and grantees will be responsible for the protection and maintenance of the property during the time that they possess the property. Upon termination of the lease term or reversion of title to the Federal government, the lessee or grantee will be responsible for removing any improvements made to the property and will be responsible for restoration of the property. If such improvements are not removed, they will <PRTPAGE P="67"/>become the property of the Federal government. GSA or the landholding agency, as appropriate, will assume responsibility for protection and maintenance of a property when the lease terminates or title reverts.</P>

HUD will inform landholding agencies or GSA if appeal of an unsuitability determination is filed by a representative of the homeless pursuant to § 12a.4(f)(4). HUD will advise the agency that it should refrain from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has completed its reconsideration process regarding unsuitability. Thereafter, or if no appeal has been filed after 20 days, GSA or the appropriate landholding agency may proceed with disposal action in accordance with applicable law.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose of these rules.</SUBJECT>

              <P>These rules implement section 203 of the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 and 504 note, for the Department of Health and Human Services. They describe the circumstances under which the Department may award attorney fees and certain other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who prevail over the Department in certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”). The Department may reimburse parties for expenses incurred in adversary adjudications if the party prevails in the proceeding and if the Department's position in the proceeding was not substantially justified or if the action is one to enforce compliance with a statutory or regulatory requirement and the Department's demand is substantially in excess of the ultimate decision and is unreasonable when compared with that decision. They also describe what proceedings constitute adversary adjudications covered by the Act, what types of persons and entities may be eligible for an award, and what procedures and standards the Department <PRTPAGE P="68"/>will use to make a determination as to whether a party may receive an award.</P>

              <P>These rules apply to adversary adjudications before the Department.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Proceedings covered.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) These rules apply only to adversary adjudications. For the purpose of these rules, only an adjudication required to be under 5 U.S.C. 554, in which the position of the Department or one of its components is represented by an attorney or other representative (“the agency's litigating party”) who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding, constitutes an adversary adjudication. These rules do not apply to proceedings for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate or for the purpose of granting, denying, or renewing a license.</P>
              <P>(b) If the agency's litigating party enters an appearance, Department proceedings listed in appendix A to this part are covered by these rules. Also covered are any other proceedings under statutes that incorporate by reference the procedures of sections 1128(f), 1128A(c)(2), or 1842(j)(2) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(f), 1320a-7a(c)(2), or 1395u(j)(2). If a proceeding is not covered under either of the two previous sentences, a party may file a fee application as otherwise required by this part and may argue that the Act covers the proceeding. Any coverage issue shall be determined by the adjudicative officer and, if necessary, by the appellate authority on review.</P>
              <P>(c) If a proceeding is covered by these rules, but also involves issues excluded under paragraph (a) of this section from the coverage of these rules, reimbursement is available only for fees and expenses resulting from covered issues.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility of applicants.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under these regulations, the applicant must be a party, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3), to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. An applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in Subpart B.</P>
              <P>(b) The categories of eligible applicants are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Charitable or other tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;</P>
              <P>(2) Cooperative associations as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees;</P>
              <P>(3) Individuals with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</P>
              <P>(4) Sole owners of unincorporated businesses if the owner has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and if the business has not more than 500 employees;</P>
              <P>(5) All other partnerships, corporations, associations, local governmental units, and public and private organizations with a net worth of not more than $7 million and with not more than 500 employees; and</P>
              <P>(6) Where an award is sought on the basis stated in § 13.5(c) of this part, small entities as defined in 5 U.S.C. 601.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purpose of determining eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant is calculated as of the date the proceeding was initiated. The net worth of an applicant is determined by generally accepted accounting principles.</P>
              <P>(d) Whether an applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” or a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” will be determined by whether the applicant's participation in the proceeding is related primarily to individual interests or to business interests.</P>

              <P>(e) The employees of an applicant include all those persons regularly providing services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.<PRTPAGE P="69"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</P>
              <P>(g) An applicant is not eligible if it appears from the facts and circumstances that it has participated in the proceedings only or primarily on behalf of other persons or entities that are ineligible.</P>
              <CITA>[48 FR 45252, Oct. 4, 1983, as amended at 69 FR 2846, Jan. 21, 2004]</CITA>

              <SECTNO>§ 13.5</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Standards for awards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An award of fees and expenses may be made either on the basis that the Department's position in the proceeding was not substantially justified or on the basis that, in a proceeding to enforce compliance with a statutory or regulatory requirement, the Department's demand substantially exceeded the ultimate decision and was unreasonable when compared with that decision. These two bases are explained in greater detail in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Awards where the Department's position was not substantially justified.</E> (1) Awards will be made on this basis only where the Department's position in the proceeding was not substantially justified. The Department's position includes, in addition to the position taken by the agency in the proceeding, the agency action or failure to act that was the basis for the proceeding. Whether the Department's position was substantially justified is to be determined on the basis of the administrative record as a whole. The fact that a party has prevailed in a proceeding does not create a presumption that the Department's position was not substantially justified. The burden of proof as to substantial justification is on the agency's litigating party, which may avoid an award by showing that its position was reasonable in law and fact.</P>
              <P>(2) When two or more matters are joined together for one hearing, each of which could have been heard separately (without regard to laws or rules fixing a jurisdictional minimum amount for claims), and an applicant has prevailed with respect to one or several of the matters, an eligible applicant may receive an award for expenses associated only with the matters on which it prevailed if the Department's position on those matters was not substantially justified.</P>
              <P>(3) Awards for fees and expenses incurred before the date on which a proceeding was initiated will be made only if the applicant can demonstrate that they were reasonably incurred in preparation for the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(4) Awards will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if other special circumstances make an award unjust.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Awards where the Department's demand was substantially excessive and unreasonable.</E> (1) Awards will be made on this basis only where the adversary adjudication arises from the Department's action to enforce a party's compliance with a statutory or regulatory requirement. An award may be made on this basis only if the Department's demand that led to the proceeding was substantially in excess of the ultimate decision in the proceeding, and that demand is unreasonable when compared with that decision, given all the facts and circumstances of the case.</P>

              <P>(2) Any award made on this basis shall be limited to the fees and expenses that are primarily related to defending against the excessive nature of the demand. An award shall not include fees and expenses that are primarily related to defending against the merits of charges, or fees and expenses that are primarily related to defending <PRTPAGE P="70"/>against the portion of the demand that was not excessive, to the extent that these fees and expenses are distinguishable from the fees and expenses primarily related to defending against the excessive nature of the demand.</P>
              <P>(3) Awards will be denied if the party has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, or if special circumstances make an award unjust.</P>
              <CITA>[48 FR 45252, Oct. 4, 1983, as amended at 69 FR 2846, Jan. 21, 2004]</CITA>

              <SUBJECT>Allowable fees and expenses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Awards will be limited to the rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses. If a party has already received, or is eligible to receive, reimbursement for any expenses under another statutory provision or another program allowing reimbursement, its award under these rules must be reduced by the amount the prevailing party has already received, or is eligible to receive, from the Federal government.</P>
              <P>(b) An award for the fees of an attorney or agent may not exceed $125.00 per hour, regardless of the actual rate charged by the attorney or agent. An award for the fees of an expert witness may not exceed the highest rate at which the Department pays expert witnesses, which is $24.09 per hour, regardless of the actual rates charged by the witness. These limits apply only to fees; an award may include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges separately for such expenses.</P>
              <P>(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fees sought for attorneys, agents or expert witnesses, the adjudicative officer must consider factors bearing on the request, which include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for like services; if the attorney, agent or witness is an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of service;</P>
              <P>(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;</P>
              <P>(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;</P>
              <P>(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and</P>
              <P>(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.</P>

              <P>The reasonable cost (or the reasonable portion of the cost) for any study, exhibit, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded to the extent that:</P>
              <P>(a) The charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate payable for similar services,</P>
              <P>(b) The study or other matter was necessary to the preparation for the administrative proceeding, and</P>
              <P>(c) The study or other matter was prepared for use in connection with the administrative proceeding. No award will be made for a study or other matter which was necessary to satisfy statutory or regulatory requirements, or which would ordinarily be conducted as part of the party's business irrespective of the administrative proceeding.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 13.11</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Net worth exhibits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each applicant must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 13.4(f) of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. This requirement does not apply to a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association. Nor does it apply to a party that states that it is applying for an award solely on the basis stated in § 13.5(c) of this part. If any individual, corporation, or other entity directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or if the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest of any corporation or other entity, the exhibit must include a showing of the net worth of all such affiliates or of the applicant including the affiliates. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</P>

              <P>(b) The net worth exhibit shall describe any transfers of assets from, or obligations incurred by, the applicant or any affiliate, occurring in the one year period prior to the date on which the proceeding was initiated, that reduced the net worth of the applicant and its affiliates below the applicable net worth ceiling. If there were no such <PRTPAGE P="72"/>transactions, the applicant shall so state.</P>
              <P>(c) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, the officer will omit the material from the public record. In that case, any decision regarding disclosure of the material (whether in response to a request from an agency or person outside the Department or on the Department's own initiative) will be made in accordance with applicable statutes and Department rules and procedures for commercial and financial records which the submitter claims are confidential or privileged. In particular, this regulation is not a basis for a promise or obligation of confidentiality.</P>

              <P>(a) All applicants must be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, exhibit, analysis, report, test or other similar item, for which the applicant seeks reimbursement.</P>
              <P>(b) The documentation shall include an affidavit from each attorney, agent, or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the party, stating the actual time expended, the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed, a description of the specific services performed, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. Where the adversary adjudication includes covered proceedings (as described in § 13.3) as well as excluded proceedings, or two or more matters, each of which could have been heard separately, the fees and expenses shall be shown separately for each proceeding or matter, and the basis for allocating expenses among the proceedings or matters shall be indicated.</P>
              <P>(1) The affidavit shall itemize in detail the services performed by the date, number of hours per date and the services performed during those hours. In order to establish the hourly rate, the affidavit shall state the hourly rate which is billed and paid by the majority of clients during the relevant time periods.</P>
              <P>(2) If no hourly rate is paid by the majority of clients because, for instance, the attorney or agent represents most clients on a contingency basis, the attorney or agent shall provide affidavits from two attorneys or agents with similar experience, who perform similar work, stating the hourly rate which they bill and are paid by the majority of their clients during a comparable time period.</P>
              <P>(c) If the applicant seeks reimbursement of any expenses not covered by the affidavit described in paragraph (b), the documentation must also include an affidavit describing all such expenses and stating the amounts paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided.</P>

              <P>(d) The adjudicative officer may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation <PRTPAGE P="73"/>for any fees or expenses claimed, pursuant to § 13.25 of this part.</P>

              <P>(d) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken, whether within the agency or to the courts, of a decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings on the application shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy.</P>

              <P>(a) Ordinarily, a decision on an application will be made on the basis of the hearing record and pleadings related to the application. However, at the request of either the applicant or the agency's litigating party, or on his or her own initiative, the adjudicative officer may order further proceedings, including an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions, or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be conducted as <PRTPAGE P="74"/>promptly as possible. In no such further proceeding shall evidence be introduced from outside the administrative record in order to prove that the Department's position was, or was not, substantially justified.</P>
              <P>(b) A request that the adjudicative officer order additional written submissions or oral testimony shall identify the information sought and shall explain why the information is necessary to decide the issues.</P>
              <P>(c) The adjudicative officer may impose sanctions on any party for failure to comply with his or her order to file pleadings, produce documents, or present witnesses for oral examination. These sanctions may include but are not limited to granting the application partly or completely, dismissing the application, and diminishing the award granted.</P>

The decision must include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, including a finding on the net worth of the applicant. Where the adjudicative officer has determined under § 13.11(b) that the applicant's net worth information is exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the finding on net worth shall be kept confidential. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on whether the agency's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, an explanation of any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded, and whether any special circumstances make the award unjust.</P>

Within another 30 days after receipt of such exceptions, the opposing party, if it has not done so previously, may file its own exceptions to the adjudicative officer's decision. The appellate authority shall issue a final decision on the application as soon as possible or remand the application to the adjudicative officer for further proceedings. Any party that does not file and serve exceptions within the stated time limit loses the opportunity to do so.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When these procedures become available.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Before the Board will take an appeal, three circumstances must be present:</P>
            <P>(a) The dispute must arise under a program which uses the Board for dispute resolution, and must meet any special conditions established for that program. An explanation is contained in appendix A.</P>
            <P>(b) The appellant must have received a final written decision, and must appeal that decision within 30 days after receiving it. Details of how final decisions are developed and issued, and what must be in them, are contained in 45 CFR 75.374.</P>

            <P>(c) The appellant must have exhausted any preliminary appeal process required by regulation. For example, see 42 CFR part 50 (subpart D) for Public Health Service programs. In such cases, the <E T="03">final written decision</E> required for the Board's review is the decision resulting from the preliminary review or appeal process. appendix A contains further details.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 16.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Summary of procedures below.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Board's basic process is review of a written record (which both parties are given ample opportunity to develop), consisting of relevant documents and statements submitted by both parties (see § 16.8). In addition, the Board may hold an informal conference (see § 16.10). The informal conference primarily involves questioning of the participants by a presiding Board member. Conferences may be conducted by telephone conference call. The written record review also may be supplemented by a hearing involving an opportunity for examining evidence and witnesses, cross-examination, and oral argument (see § 16.11). A hearing is more expensive and time-consuming than a determination on the written record alone or with an informal conference. Generally, therefore, the Board will schedule a hearing only if the Board determines that there are complex issues or material facts in dispute, or that the Board's review would otherwise be significantly enhanced by a hearing. Where the amount in dispute is $25,000 or less, there are special expedited procedures (see § 16.12 of this part). In all cases, the Board has the flexibility to modify procedures to ensure fairness, to avoid delay, and to accommodate the peculiar needs of a given case. The Board makes maximum feasible use of preliminary informal steps to refine issues and to encourage resolution by the parties. The Board also has the capability to provide mediation services (see § 16.18).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 16.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How the Board operates.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Board's professional staff consists of a Chair (who is also a Board member) and full- and part-time Board members, all appointed by the Secretary; and a staff of employees and consultants who are attorneys or persons from other relevant disciplines, such as accounting.</P>

            <P>(b) The Chair will assign a Board member to have lead responsibility for each case (the “presiding Board member”). The presiding Board member will conduct the conference or hearing, if one is held. Each decision of the Board is issued by the presiding Board member and two other Board members.<PRTPAGE P="78"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) The Board staff assists the presiding Board member, and may request information from the parties; conduct telephone conference calls to request information, to clarify issues, or to schedule events; and assist in developing decisions and other documents in a case.</P>
            <P>(d) The Chair will assure that no Board or staff member will participate in a case where his or her impartiality could reasonably be questioned.</P>
            <P>(e) The Board's powers and responsibilities are set forth in § 16.13.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 16.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Who represents the parties.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The appellant's notice of appeal, or the first subsequent submission to the Board, should specify the name, address and telephone number of the appellant's representative. In its first submission to the Board and the appellant, the respondent (i.e., the federal party to the appeal) should specify the name, address and telephone number of the respondent's representative.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 16.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>The first steps in the appeal process: The notice of appeal and the Board's response.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As explained in 45 CFR 75.374, a prospective appellant must submit a notice of appeal to the Board within 30 days after receiving the final decision. The notice of appeal must include a copy of the final decision, a statement of the amount in dispute in the appeal, and a brief statement of why the decision is wrong.</P>
            <P>(b) Within ten days after receiving the notice of appeal, the Board will send an acknowledgment, enclose a copy of these procedures, and advise the appellant of the next steps. The Board will also send a copy of the notice of appeal, its attachments, and the Board's acknowledgment to the respondent. If the Board Chair has determined that the appeal does not meet the conditions of § 16.3 or if further information is needed to make this determination, the Board will notify the parties at this point.</P>

            <P>Except in expedited cases (generally those of $25,000 or less; see § 16.12 for details), the appellant and the respondent each participate in developing an appeal file for the Board to review. Each also submits written argument in support of its position. The responsibilities of each are as follows:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">The appellant's responsibility.</E> Within 30 days after receiving the acknowledgment of the appeal, the appellant shall submit the following to the Board (with a copy to the respondent):</P>
            <P>(1) An appeal file containing the documents supporting the claim, tabbed and organized chronologically and accompanied by an indexed list identifying each document. The appellant should include only those documents which are important to the Board's decision on the issues in the case.</P>
            <P>(2) A written statement of the appellant's argument concerning why the respondent's final decision is wrong (appellant's brief).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">The respondent's responsibility.</E> Within 30 days after receiving the appellant's submission under paragraph (a) of this section, the respondent shall submit the following to the Board (with a copy to the appellant):</P>
            <P>(1) A supplement to the appeal file containing any additional documents supporting the respondent's position, organized and indexed as indicated under paragraph (a) of this section. The respondent should avoid submitting duplicates of documents submitted by the appellant.</P>
            <P>(2) A written statement (respondent's brief) responding to the appellant's brief.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">The appellant's reply.</E> Within 15 days after receiving the respondent's submission, the appellant may submit a short reply. The appellant should avoid repeating arguments already made.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Cooperative efforts.</E> Whenever possible, the parties should try to develop a joint appeal file, agree to preparation of the file by one of them, agree to facts to eliminate the need for some documents, or agree that one party will submit documents identified by the other.<PRTPAGE P="79"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Voluminous documentation.</E> Where submission of all relevant documents would lead to a voluminous appeal file (for example where review of a disputed audit finding of inadequate documentation might involve thousands of receipts), the Board will consult with the parties about how to reduce the size of the file.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 16.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How the Board will promote development of the record.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Board may, at the time it acknowledges an appeal or at any appropriate later point, request additional documents or information; request briefing on issues in the case; issue orders to show cause why a proposed finding or decision of the Board should not become final; hold preliminary conferences (generally by telephone) to establish schedules and refine issues; and take such other steps as the Board determines appropriate to develop a prompt, sound decision.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 16.10</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Using a conference.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Once the Board has reviewed the appeal file, the Board may, on its own or in response to a party's request, schedule an informal conference. The conference will be conducted by the presiding Board member. The purposes of the conference are to give the parties an opportunity to make an oral presentation and the Board an opportunity to clarify issues and question both parties about matters which the Board may not yet fully understand from the record.</P>
            <P>(b) If the Board has decided to hold a conference, the Board will consult or correspond with the parties to schedule the conference, identify issues, and discuss procedures. The Board will identify the persons who will be allowed to participate, along with the parties' representatives, in the conference. The parties can submit with their briefs under § 16.8 a list of persons who might participate with them, indicating how each person is involved in the matter. If the parties wish, they may also suggest questions or areas of inquiry which the Board may wish to pursue with each participant.</P>
            <P>(c) Unless the parties and the Board otherwise agree, the following procedures apply:</P>
            <P>(1) Conferences will be recorded at Department expense. On request, a party will be sent one copy of the transcript. The presiding Board member will insure an orderly transcript by controlling the sequence and identification of speakers.</P>
            <P>(2) Only in exceptional circumstances will documents be received at a conference. Inquiry will focus on material in the appeal file. If a party finds that further documents should be in the record for the conference, the party should supplement the appeal file, submitting a supplementary index and copies of the documents to the Board and the other party not less than ten days prior to the conference.</P>
            <P>(3) Each party's representative may make an oral presentation. Generally, the only oral communications of other participants will consist of statements requested by the Board or responses to the Board's questions. The Board will allow reply comment, and may allow short closing statements. On request, the Board may allow the participants to question each other.</P>
            <P>(4) There will be no post-conference submissions, unless the Board determines they would be helpful to resolve the case. The Board may require or allow the parties to submit proposed findings and conclusions.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 16.11</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Hearing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Electing a hearing.</E> If the appellant believes a hearing is appropriate, the appellant should specifically request one at the earliest possible time (in the notice of appeal or with the appeal file). The Board will approve a request (and may schedule a hearing on its own or in response to a later request) if it finds there are complex issues or material facts in dispute the resolution of which would be significantly aided by a hearing, or if the Board determines that its decisionmaking otherwise would be enhanced by oral presentations and arguments in an adversary, evidentiary hearing. The Board will also provide a hearing if otherwise required by law or regulation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Preliminary conference before the hearing.</E> The Board generally will hold a prehearing conference (which may be conducted by telephone conference call) to consider any of the following: <PRTPAGE P="80"/>the possibility of settlement; simplifying and clarifying issues; stipulations and admissions; limitations on evidence and witnesses that will be presented at the hearing; scheduling the hearing; and any other matter that may aid in resolving the appeal. Normally, this conference will be conducted informally and off the record; however, the Board, after consulting with the parties, may reduce results of the conference to writing in a document which will be made part of the record, or may transcribe proceedings and make the transcript part of the record.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Where hearings are held.</E> Hearings generally are held in Washington, DC. In exceptional circumstances, the Board may hold the hearing at an HHS Regional Office or other convenient facility near the appellant.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Conduct of the hearing.</E> (1) The presiding Board member will conduct the hearing. Hearings will be as informal as reasonably possible, keeping in mind the need to establish an orderly record. The presiding Board member generally will admit evidence unless it is determined to be clearly irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious, so the parties should avoid frequent objections to questions and documents. Both sides may make opening and closing statements, may present witnesses as agreed upon in the prehearing conference, and may cross-examine. Since the parties have ample opportunity to develop a complete appeal file, a party may introduce an exhibit at the hearing only after explaining to the satisfaction of the presiding Board member why the exhibit was not submitted earlier (for example, because the information was not available).</P>
            <P>(2) The Board may request the parties to submit written statements of witnesses to the Board and each other prior to the hearing so that the hearing will primarily be concerned with cross-examination and rebuttal.</P>
            <P>(3) False statements of a witness may be the basis for criminal prosecution under sections 287 and 1001 of Title 18 of the United States Code.</P>
            <P>(4) The hearing will be recorded at Department expense.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedures after the hearing.</E> The Board will send one copy of the transcript to each party as soon as it is received by the Board. At the discretion of the Board, the parties may be required or allowed to submit post-hearing briefs or proposed findings and conclusions (the parties will be informed at the hearing). A party should note any major prejudicial transcript errors in an addendum to its post-hearing brief (or if no brief will be submitted, in a letter submitted within a time limit set by the Board).</P>

If the Board and the parties agree, the Board may use these procedures in cases of more than $25,000.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> If there are unique or unusually complex issues involved, or other exceptional circumstances, the Board may use additional procedures.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Regular expedited procedures.</E> (1) Within 30 days after receiving the Board's acknowledgment of the appeal (see § 16.7), each party shall submit to the Board and the other party any relevant background documents (organized as required under § 16.8), with a cover letter (generally not to exceed ten pages) containing any arguments the party wishes to make.</P>
            <P>(2) Promptly after receiving the parties' submissions, the presiding Board member will arrange a telephone conference call to receive the parties' oral comments in response to each other's submissions. After notice to the parties, the Board will record the call. The Board member will advise the parties whether any opportunities for further briefing, submissions or oral presentations will be established. Cooperative efforts will be encouraged (see § 16.8(d)).</P>
            <P>(3) The Board may require the parties to submit proposed findings and conclusions.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Special expedited procedures where there has already been review.</E> Some HHS components (for example, the Public Health Service) use a board or other relatively independent reviewing authority to conduct a formal preliminary review process which results in a <PRTPAGE P="81"/>written decision based on a record including documents or statements presented after reasonable notice and opportunity to present such material. In such cases, the following rules apply to appeals of $25,000 or less instead of those under paragraph (c) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) Generally, the Board's review will be restricted to whether the decision of the preliminary review authority was clearly erroneous. But if the Board determines that the record is inadequate, or that the procedures under which the record was developed in a given instance were unfair, the Board will not be restricted this way.</P>
            <P>(2) Within 30 days after receiving the Board's acknowledgment of appeal (see § 16.7), the parties shall submit the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The appellant shall submit to the Board and the respondent a statement why the decision was clearly erroneous. Unless allowed by the Board after consultation with the respondent, the appellant shall not submit further documents.</P>
            <P>(ii) The respondent shall submit to the Board the record in the case. If the respondent has reason to believe that all materials in the record already are in the possession of the appellant, the respondent need only send the appellant a list of the materials submitted to the Board.</P>
            <P>(iii) The respondent may, if it wishes, submit a statement why the decision was not clearly erroneous.</P>
            <P>(3) The Board, in its discretion, may allow or require the parties to present further arguments or information.</P>

            <P>In addition to powers specified elsewhere in these procedures, Board members have the power to issue orders (including “show cause” orders); to examine witnesses; to take all steps necessary for the conduct of an orderly hearing; to rule on requests and motions, including motions to dismiss; to grant extensions of time for good reasons; to dismiss for failure to meet deadlines and other requirements; to close or suspend cases which are not ready for review; to order or assist the parties to submit relevant information; to remand a case for further action by the respondent; to waive or modify these procedures in a specific case with notice to the parties; to reconsider a Board decision where a party promptly alleges a clear error of fact or law; and to take any other action necessary to resolve disputes in accordance with the objectives of these procedures.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Failure to meet deadlines and other requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Since one of the objectives of administrative dispute resolution is to provide a decision as fast as possible consistent with fairness, the Board will not allow parties to delay the process unduly. The Board may grant extensions of time, but only if the party gives a good reason for the delay.</P>
            <P>(b) If the appellant fails to meet any filing or procedural deadlines, appeal file or brief submission requirements, or other requirements established by the Board, the Board may dismiss the appeal, may issue an order requiring the party to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed, or may take other action the Board considers appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) If the respondent fails to meet any such requirements, the Board may issue a decision based on the record submitted to that point or take such other measures as the Board considers appropriate.</P>

            <P>(a) The only parties to the appeal are the appellant and the respondent. If the Board determines that a third person is a real party in interest (for example, where the major impact of an audit disallowance would be on the grantee's contractor, not on the grantee), the Board may allow the third person to present the case on appeal for the appellant or to appear with a party in the case, after consultation with the parties and if the appellant does not object.</P>

            <P>(b) The Board may also allow other participation, in the manner and by the deadlines established by the Board, where the Board decides that the intervenor has a clearly identifiable and <PRTPAGE P="82"/>substantial interest in the outcome of the dispute, that participation would sharpen issues or otherwise be helpful in resolution of the dispute, and that participation would not result in substantial delay.</P>

            <P>(a) A party shall not communicate with a Board or staff member about matters involved in an appeal without notice to the other party. If such communication occurs, the Board will disclose it to the other party and make it part of the record after the other party has an opportunity to comment. Board members and staff shall not consider any information outside the record (see § 16.21 for what the record consists of) about matters involved in an appeal.</P>
            <P>(b) The above does not apply to the following: Communications among Board members and staff; communications concerning the Board's administrative functions or procedures; requests from the Board to a party for a document (although the material submitted in response also must be given to the other party); and material which the Board includes in the record after notice and an opportunity to comment.</P>

The mediator may take any steps agreed upon by the parties to resolve the dispute or clarify issues. The results of mediation are not binding on the parties unless the parties so agree in writing. The Board will internally insulate the mediator from any Board or staff members assigned to handle the appeal.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">In other cases.</E> In any other grants dispute, the Board may, within the limitations of its resources, offer persons trained in mediation skills to aid in resolving the dispute. Mediation services will only be offered at the request, or with the concurrence, of a responsible federal program official in the program under which the dispute arises. The Board will insulate the mediator if any appeal subsequently arises from the dispute.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How long an appeal takes.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The Board has established general goals for its consideration of cases, as follows (measured from the point when the Board receives the first submission after the notice of appeal):
            </P>
            <EXTRACT>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—For regular review based on a written record under § 16.8, 6 months. When a conference under § 16.10 is held, the goal remains at 6 months, unless a requirement for post-conference briefing in a particular case renders the goal unrealistic.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—For cases involving a hearing under § 16.11, 9 months.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—For the expedited process under § 16.12, 3 months.</FP>
            </EXTRACT>
            
            <P>These are goals, not rigid requirements. The paramount concern of the Board is to take the time needed to review a record fairly and adequately in order to produce a sound decision. Furthermore, many factors are beyond the Board's direct control, such as unforeseen delays due to the parties' negotiations or requests for extensions, how many cases are filed, and Board resources. On the other hand, the parties may agree to steps which may shorten review by the Board; for example, by waiving the right to submit a brief, by agreeing to shorten submission schedules, or by electing the expedited process.</P>

            <EAR>Pt. 16, App. A</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 16—What Disputes the Board Reviews</HD>
            <FP>
              <E T="03">A. What this appendix covers.</E>
            </FP>

            <P>This appendix describes programs which use the Board for dispute resolution, the types of disputes covered, and any conditions for Board review of final written decisions resulting from those disputes. Disputes under programs not specified in this appendix may be covered in a program regulation or in a memorandum of understanding between the Board and the head of the appropriate HHS operating component or other agency responsible for administering the program. If in doubt, call the Board. Even though a dispute may be covered here, the Board still may not be able to review it if the limits in paragraph F apply.
            </P>
            <FP>
              <E T="03">B. Mandatory grant programs.</E>
            </FP>
            <P>(a) The Board reviews the following types of final written decisions in disputes arising in HHS programs authorizing the award of mandatory grants:</P>
            <P>(1) Disallowances under Titles I, IV, VI, X, XIV, XVI(AABD), XIX, and XX of the Social Security Act, including penalty disallowances such as those under sections 403(g) and 1903(g) of the Act and fiscal disallowances based on quality control samples.</P>
            <P>(2) Disallowances in mandatory grant programs administered by the Public Health Service, including Title V of the Social Security Act.</P>
            <P>(3) Disallowances in the programs under sections 113 and 132 of the Developmental Disabilities Act.</P>
            <P>(4) Disallowances under Title III of the Older American Act.</P>
            <P>(5) Decisions relating to repayment and withholding under block grant programs as provided in 45 CFR 96.52.</P>
            <P>(6) Decisions relating to repayment and withholding under State Legalization Impact Assistance Grants as provided in 45 CFR 402.24 and 402.25.</P>

            <P>(b) In some of these disputes, there is an option for review by the head of the granting agency prior to appeal to the Board. Where <PRTPAGE P="84"/>an appellant has requested review by the agency head first, the “final written decision” required by § 16.3 for purposes of Board review will generally be the agency head's decision affirming the disallowance. If the agency head declines to review the disallowance or if the appellant withdraws its request for review by the agency head, the original disallowance decision is the “final written decision.” In the latter cases, the 30-day period for submitting a notice of appeal begins with the date of receipt of the notice declining review or with the date of the withdrawal letter.
            </P>
            <FP>
              <E T="03">C. Direct, discretionary project programs.</E>
            </FP>
            <P>(a) The Board reviews the following types of final written decisions in disputes arising in any HHS program authorizing the award of direct, discretionary project grants or cooperative agreements:</P>
            <P>(1) A disallowance or other determination denying payment of an amount claimed under an award, or requiring return or set-off of funds already received. This does not apply to determinations of award amount or disposition of unobligated balances, or selection in the award document of an option for disposition of program-related income.</P>
            <P>(2) A termination for failure to comply with the terms of an award.</P>
            <P>(3) A denial of a noncompeting continuation award under the project period system of funding where the denial is for failure to comply with the terms of a previous award.</P>
            <P>(4) A voiding (a decision that an award is invalid because it was not authorized by statute or regulation or because it was fraudulently obtained).</P>

            <P>(b) Where an HHS component uses a preliminary appeal process (for example, the Public Health Service), the “final written decision” for purposes of Board review is the decision issued as a result of that process.
            </P>
            <FP>
              <E T="03">D. Cost allocation and rate disputes.</E>
            </FP>

            <P>The Board reviews final written decisions in disputes which may affect a number of HHS programs because they involve cost allocation plans or rate determinations. These include decisions related to cost allocation plans negotiated with State or local governments and negotiated rates such as indirect cost rates, fringe benefit rates, computer rates, research patient care rates, and other special rates.
            </P>
            <FP>
              <E T="03">E. SSI agreement disputes.</E>
            </FP>

            <P>The Board reviews disputes in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program arising under agreements for Federal administration of State supplementary payments under section 1616 of the Social Security Act or mandatory minimum supplements under section 212 of Pub. L. 93-66. In these cases, the Board provides an opportunity to be heard and offer evidence at the Secretarial level of review as set out in the applicable agreements. Thus, the “final written decision” for purposes of Board review is that determination appealable to the Secretary under the agreement.
            </P>
            <FP>
              <E T="03">F. Where Board review is not available.</E>
            </FP>

            <P>The Board will not review a decision if a hearing under 5 U.S.C. 554 is required by statute, if the basis of the decision is a violation of applicable civil rights or nondiscrimination laws or regulations (for example, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act), or if some other hearing process is established pursuant to statute.
            </P>
            <FP>
              <E T="03">G. How the Board determines whether it will review a case.</E>
            </FP>
            <P>Under § 16.7, the Board Chair determines whether an appeal meets the requirements of this appendix. If the Chair finds that there is some question about this, the Board will request the written opinion of the HHS component which issued the decision. Unless the Chair determines that the opinion is clearly erroneous, the Board will be bound by the opinion. If the HHS component does not respond within a time set by the Chair, or cannot determine whether the Board clearly does or does not have jurisdiction, the Board will take the appeal.</P>

However, where the Department or principal operating component determines that public harm can be avoided by immediate discontinuance of an offending practice, a respondent shall be allowed an opportunity, where feasible, to cease the practice (pending a legal test) in lieu of release of adverse information by the agency.</P>
            <P>(b) Where it is required in order to bring notice of pending agency adjudication to persons likely to desire to participate therein or likely to be affected by that or a related adjudication, the Department or principal operating component shall rely on the news media to the extent necessary to provide such notice even though it may be adverse to a respondent.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Description of the Symbol, Logo, and Seal.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Departmental Symbol (Symbol) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the key element in Department identification. It represents the American People sheltered in the wing of the American <PRTPAGE P="86"/>Eagle, suggesting the Department's concern and responsibility for the welfare of the people. This Symbol is the visual link which connects the graphic communications of all components and programs of the Department. It is the major design component for the Department Identifiers — the Department Logo, Seal, and Signatures.</P>
            <P>(b) The Symbol is described as follows: The outline of an American Eagle, facing left, with one of its wings stretched upward and the other wing pointed downward, is flanked on its right side by two outlines of the profile of a human head, both of which are located in between the eagle's wings. One of the profile outlines is smaller than the other and is nestled in the larger outline.</P>

            <P>(d) The HHS Departmental Seal (Seal) incorporates the Symbol and is described as follows: Starting from the tip of the downward-facing wing of the American Eagle in the HHS symbol and forming a complete circle clockwise around the HHS symbol, the words, “DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH &amp; HUMAN SERVICES • USA •” are printed, surrounded by a border composed of a solid inner ring at the base of the text and a triangular, scalloped edge at the top of the text. The official colors of the Seal are Reflex Blue and Gold [Reflex Blue RGB Numbers: 0/0/153 (R0, G0, B153); Reflex Gold RGB Numbers: 254/252/1 (R254, G252, B1)].

              <P>(v) Will be collected under internal offset procedures within three years after the debt first became delinquent; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Is exempt from this requirement based on a determination by the Secretary of the Treasury that exemption for a certain class of debt is in the best interest of the United States.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Demand for payment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Written demand for payment.</E> (1) Written demand, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, shall be made promptly upon a debtor in terms that inform the debtor of the consequences of failing to cooperate with the Department to resolve the debt.</P>
              <P>(2) Normally, the demand letter will be sent no later than 30 days after the appropriate official determines that the debt exists. The demand letter shall be sent by first class mail to the debtor's last known address.</P>
              <P>(3) When necessary to protect the Government's interest, for example to prevent the running of a statute of limitations, the written demand for payment may be preceded by other appropriate action under this part, including immediate referral to Justice for litigation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Demand letters.</E> The specific content, timing, and number of demand letters shall depend upon the type and amount of the debt and the debtor's response, if any, to the Department's letters or telephone calls. Generally, one demand letter should suffice; however, more may be used.</P>
              <P>(1) The written demand for payment shall include the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) The nature and amount of the debt, including the basis for the indebtedness;</P>
              <P>(ii) The date by which payment should be made to avoid late charges and enforced collection, which generally shall be no later than 30 days from the date the demand letter is mailed;</P>
              <P>(iii) The applicable standards for imposing any interest, penalties, or administrative costs (see § 30.18);</P>
              <P>(iv) The rights, if any, the debtor may have to:</P>
              <P>(A) Seek review of the Department's determination of the debt, and for purposes of administrative wage garnishment or salary offset, to request a hearing (see 45 CFR parts 32 and 33); and</P>
              <P>(B) Enter into a reasonable repayment agreement.</P>
              <P>(v) An explanation of how the debtor may exercise any of the rights described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section;</P>
              <P>(vi) The name, address, and phone number of a contact person or office within the Department to address any debt-related matters; and</P>
              <P>(vii) The Department's remedies to enforce payment of the debt, which may include:</P>
              <P>(A) Garnishing the debtor's wages through administrative wage garnishment;</P>

              <P>(B) Offsetting any Federal payments due the debtor, including income tax refunds, salary, certain benefit payments such as Social Security, retirement, and travel reimbursements and advances;<PRTPAGE P="93"/>
              </P>
              <P>(C) Referring the debt to a private collection contractor;</P>
              <P>(D) Reporting the debt to a credit bureau or other automated database;</P>
              <P>(E) Referring the debt to Justice for litigation; and</P>
              <P>(F) Referring the debt to Treasury for any of the collection actions described in paragraphs (b)(1)(vii)(A) through (E) of this section, advising the debtor that such referral is mandatory if the debt is 180 or more days delinquent.</P>
              <P>(2) The written demand for payment should also include the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) The debtor's right to inspect and copy all records of the Department pertaining to the debt, or if the debtor or the debtor's representative cannot personally inspect the records, to request and receive copies of such records;</P>
              <P>(ii) The Department's willingness to discuss with the debtor alternative methods of payment;</P>
              <P>(iii) A debtor delinquent on a debt is ineligible for Government loans, loan guarantees, or loan insurance until the debtor resolves the debt;</P>
              <P>(iv) When seeking to collect statutory penalties, forfeiture or other similar types of claim, the debtor's licenses, permits, or other privileges may be suspended or revoked if failure to pay the debt is inexcusable or willful. Such suspension or revocation shall extend to programs or activities administered by the States on behalf of the Federal Government, to the extent that they affect the Federal Government's ability to collect money or funds owed by debtors;</P>
              <P>(v) Knowingly making false statements or bringing frivolous actions may subject the debtor to civil or criminal penalties under 31 U.S.C. 3729-3731, 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002, or any other applicable statutory authority, and, if the debtor is a Federal employee, to disciplinary action under 5 CFR part 752 or other applicable authority;</P>
              <P>(vi) Any amounts collected and ultimately found not to have been owed by the debtor will be refunded;</P>
              <P>(vii) For salary offset, up to 15% of the debtor's current disposable pay may be deducted every pay period until the debt is paid in full; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Dependent upon applicable statutory authority, the debtor may be entitled to consideration for a waiver.</P>
              <P>(c) The Secretary will retain evidence of service indicating the date of mailing of the demand letter. The evidence of service, which may include a certificate of service, may be retained electronically so long as the manner of retention is sufficient for evidentiary purposes.</P>
              <P>(d) Prior to, during, or after the completion of the demand process, if the Secretary determines to pursue, or is required to pursue offset, the procedures applicable to offset should be followed (see § 30.12). The availability of funds for debt satisfaction by offset and the Secretary's determination to pursue collection by offset shall release the Secretary from the necessity of further compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Finding debtors.</E> The Secretary will use every reasonable effort to locate debtors, using such sources as telephone directories, city directories, postmasters, drivers license records, automobile title and license records in State and local government agencies, the IRS, credit reporting agencies and skip locator services. Referral of a confess-judgment note to the appropriate United States Attorney's Office for entry of judgment will not be delayed because the debtor cannot be located.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Communications from debtors.</E> The Secretary should respond promptly to communications from debtor, within 30 days where feasible, and should advise debtors who dispute debts to furnish available evidence to support their contentions.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Exception.</E> This section does not require duplication of any notice already contained in a written agreement, letter or other document signed by, or provided to, the debtor.</P>

              <P>(i) Debts arising under the Social Security Act, except as provided in 42 U.S.C. 404;<PRTPAGE P="94"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Payments made under the Social Security Act, except as provided for in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c), and implementing regulation at 31 CFR 285.4;</P>
              <P>(iii) Debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code or the tariff laws of the United States;</P>
              <P>(iv) Offsets against Federal salaries to the extent these standards are inconsistent with regulations published to implement such offsets under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 (see 5 CFR part 550, subpart K; 31 CFR 285.7; and part 33 of this chapter);</P>
              <P>(v) Offsets under 31 U.S.C. 3728 against a judgment obtained by a debtor against the United States;</P>
              <P>(vi) Offsets or recoupments under common law, State law, or Federal statutes specifically prohibiting offsets or recoupments for particular types of debts; or</P>
              <P>(vii) Offsets in the course of judicial proceedings, including bankruptcy.</P>
              <P>(3) Unless otherwise provided for by contract or law, debts or payments that are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.</P>
              <P>(4) Unless otherwise provided by law, collection by administrative offset under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3716 may not be conducted more than 10 years after the Department's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Department's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the Secretary. This limitation does not apply to debts reduced to judgment.</P>
              <P>(5) Where there is reason to believe that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, the Office of the General Counsel should be contacted for legal advice concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 106, 362 and 553, on pending or contemplated collections by offset.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Centralized administrative offset.</E> (1) Except as provided in the exceptions listed in § 30.10(c)(1), legally enforceable debts which are 180 days delinquent shall be referred to the Secretary of the Treasury for collection by centralized administrative offset pursuant to and in accordance with 31 CFR 901.3(b). Debts which are less than 180 days delinquent, including debts referred to the Department by another agency, also may be referred to the Secretary of the Treasury for collection by centralized administrative offset.</P>
              <P>(2) When referring delinquent debts to the Secretary of the Treasury for centralized administrative offset, the Department must certify, in a form acceptable to the Secretary of the Treasury, that:</P>
              <P>(i) The debt is past due and legally enforceable; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Department has complied with all due process requirements under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt from centralized administrative offset. The Secretary of the Treasury shall exempt payments under means-tested programs from centralized administrative offset when requested in writing by the head of the payment certifying or authorizing agency. Also, the Secretary of the Treasury may exempt other classes of payments from centralized offset upon the written request of the head of the payment certifying or authorizing agency.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Non-centralized administrative offset.</E> (1) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized administrative offset under paragraph (b) of this section is not available or appropriate, the Secretary may collect a delinquent debt by conducting non-centralized administrative offset internally or in cooperation with the agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, administrative offset may be initiated only after:</P>
              <P>(i) The debtor has been sent written notice of the type and amount of the debt, the intention of the Department to initiate administrative offset to collect the debt, and an explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The debtor has been given:</P>
              <P>(A) The opportunity to inspect and copy Department records related to the debt;</P>

              <P>(B) The opportunity for a review within the Department of the determination of indebtedness; and<PRTPAGE P="95"/>
              </P>
              <P>(C) The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.</P>
              <P>(3) The due process requirements under paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be omitted when:</P>
              <P>(i) Offset is in the nature of a recoupment, i.e., the debt and the payment to be offset arise out of the same transaction or occurrence;</P>
              <P>(ii) The debt arises under a contract as set forth in Cecile Industries, Inc. v. Cheney, 995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets covered by the Contracts Disputes Act); or</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of non-centralized administrative offset conducted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Department first learns of the existence of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior notice and an opportunity for review. When prior notice and an opportunity for review are omitted, the Secretary shall give the debtor such notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practical and shall promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government.</P>
              <P>(4) When the debtor previously has been given any of the required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular debt, such as under § 30.11 of this part, the Department need not duplicate such notice and review opportunities before administrative offset may be initiated.</P>
              <P>(5) Before requesting that a payment authorizing agency to conduct non-centralized administrative offset, the Department shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Provide the debtor with due process as set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide the payment authorizing agency written certification that the debtor owes the past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that the Department has fully complied with this section.</P>
              <P>(6) When a creditor agency requests that the Department, as the payment authorizing agency, conduct non-centralized administrative offset, the Secretary shall comply with the request, unless the offset would not be in the best interest of the United States with respect to the program of the Department, or would otherwise be contrary to law. Appropriate use should be made of the cooperative efforts of other agencies in effecting collection by administrative offset, including salary offset.</P>
              <P>(7) When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative offset, the Department will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, particularly the applicable statute of limitations.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Requests to OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the Federal Employee Retirement System.</E> Upon providing OPM written certification that a debtor has been afforded the procedures provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Department may request OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in accordance with 5 CFR part 831, subpart R, or under the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) in accordance with 5 CFR part 845, subpart D. Upon receipt of such a request, OPM will identify and “flag” a debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests, or becomes eligible to receive, payments from the Fund or under FERS. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to the expiration of the time limitations referenced in 31 CFR 901.3(b)(4).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Review requirements.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, whenever the Secretary is required to afford a debtor a review within the Department, the debtor shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Secretary determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.<PRTPAGE P="96"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although the Department will carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(3) An oral hearing is not required with respect to debt collection systems where determinations of indebtedness rarely involve issues of credibility or veracity, and the Secretary has determined that a review of the written record is adequate to correct prior mistakes.</P>
              <P>(4) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this section, the Secretary shall accord the debtor a “paper hearing,” that is, a determination of the request for reconsideration based upon a review of the written record.</P>

              <P>(2) Debts owed by individuals will be reported to consumer reporting agencies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12).</P>

              <P>(a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary may contract with private collection contractors to recover delinquent debts, provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) The Secretary retains the authority to resolve disputes, compromise debts, suspend or terminate collection action, and refer debts to Justice for litigation;</P>
              <P>(2) The private collection contractor is not allowed to offer the debtor, as an incentive for payment, the opportunity to pay the debt less the private collection contractor's fee unless the Secretary has granted such authority prior to the offer;</P>
              <P>(3) The contract provides that the private collection contractor is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m), and to applicable Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to debt collection practices, including but not limited to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692; and</P>

              <P>(4) The private collection contractor is required to account for all amounts collected.<PRTPAGE P="97"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary shall use government-wide debt collection contracts to obtain debt collection services provided by private collection contractors. However, the Secretary may refer debts to private collection contractors pursuant to a contract between the Department and the private collection contractor only if such debts are not subject to the requirement to transfer debts to the Department of the Treasury for debt collection under 31 U.S.C. 3711(g) and 31 CFR 285.12(e).</P>
              <P>(c) Debts arising under the Social Security Act (which can be collected by private collection contractors only by Treasury after the debt has been referred to Treasury for collection) are excluded from this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The Secretary may fund private collection contractor contracts in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(d), or as otherwise permitted by law. A contract under paragraph (a) of this section may provide that the fee a private collection contractor charges the Department for collecting the debt is payable from the amounts collected.</P>
              <P>(e) The Department may enter into contracts for locating and recovering assets of the United States including unclaimed assets. However, before entering into a contract to recover assets of the United States that may be held by a State government or financial institution, the Department must establish procedures that are acceptable to the Secretary of Treasury.</P>
              <P>(f) The Secretary may enter into contracts for debtor asset and income search reports. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(d), such contracts may provide that the fee a contractor charges the Department for such services may be payable from the amounts recovered, unless otherwise prohibited by statute.</P>

Such suspension or revocation will extend to programs or activities administered by the States on behalf of the Federal Government, to the extent that they affect the Federal Government's ability to collect money or funds owed by debtors.</P>
              <P>(d) Where there is reason to believe that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, before taking any action to suspend or revoke under paragraph (c) of this section, the Office of the General Counsel should be contacted for legal advice concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 362 and 525, which may restrict such action.</P>

              <P>(2) Collection from other sources, including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a prerequisite to requiring payment by a surety, insurer, or <PRTPAGE P="98"/>guarantor unless such action is expressly required by statute or contract.</P>
              <P>(3) The Secretary will give the debtor reasonable notice of the sale and an accounting of any surplus proceeds and will comply with other requirements under law or contract.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Collection in installments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Whenever feasible, the total amount of a debt shall be collected in one lump sum payment. If a debtor is financially unable to pay a debt in one lump sum, either by funds or administrative offset, the Secretary may accept payment in regular installments. The Secretary will obtain financial statements from debtors who represent that they are unable to pay in one lump sum and independently verify such representations as described in § 30.22(a)(1).</P>
              <P>(b)(1) When the Secretary agrees to accept payments in regular installments, a legally enforceable written agreement should be obtained from the debtor that specifies all the terms and conditions of the agreement, and that includes a provision accelerating the debt in the event of a default.</P>
              <P>(2) The size and frequency of the payments should reasonably relate to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. Whenever feasible, the installment agreement will provide for full payment of the debt, including interest and charges, in three years or less.</P>
              <P>(3) In appropriate cases, the agreement should include a provision identifying security obtained from the debtor for the deferred payments.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section, the Department shall charge interest, penalties, and administrative costs on delinquent debts owed to the United States. These charges shall continue to accrue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved through compromise, termination, or waiver of the charges.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Interest.</E> The Department shall charge interest on delinquent debts owed the United States as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Interest shall accrue from the date of delinquency, or as otherwise provided by law. For debts not paid by the date specified in the written demand for payment made under § 30.11, the date of delinquency is the date of mailing of the notice. The date of delinquency for an installment payment is the due date specified in the payment agreement.</P>

              <P>(2) Unless a different rate is prescribed by statute, contract, or a repayment agreement, the rate of interest charged shall be the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. The Department may charge a higher rate if necessary to protect the rights of the United States and the Secretary has determined and documented a higher rate for delinquent debt is required to protect the Government's interests. Any such higher rate of interest charged will be based on Treasury's quarterly rate certification to the U.S. Public Health Service for delinquencies in the National Research Services Awards and the National Health Services Corps Scholarship Program. The Department publishes this rate in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> quarterly.</P>

              <P>(3) Unless prescribed by statute or contract, the rate of interest, as initially charged, shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. When a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, the Department may require payment of interest at a new rate that reflects the Treasury rate in effect at the time the new agreement is executed. Interest shall not be compounded, that is, interest shall not be charged on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section, unless prescribed by statute or contract. If, however, the debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, charges that accrued but were <PRTPAGE P="99"/>not collected under the defaulted agreement shall be added to the principal under the new repayment agreement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrative costs.</E> The Department shall assess administrative costs incurred for processing and handling delinquent debts. The calculation of administrative costs should be based on actual costs incurred or a valid estimate of the actual costs. Calculation of administrative costs shall include all direct (personnel, supplies, etc.) and indirect collection costs, including the cost of providing a hearing or any other form of administrative review requested by a debtor, and any costs charged by a collection agency under § 30.14. These charges will be assessed monthly, or per payment period, throughout the period that the debt is overdue. Such costs may also be in addition to other administrative costs if collection is being made for another Federal agency or unit.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Penalty.</E> Unless otherwise established by contract, repayment agreement, or statute, the Secretary will charge a penalty of six percent a year on the amount due on a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge shall accrue from the date of delinquency.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Cost of living adjustment.</E> When there is a legitimate reason to do so, such as when calculating interest and penalties on a debt would be extremely difficult because of the age of the debt, an administrative debt may be increased by the cost of living adjustment in lieu of charging interest and penalties under this section. Administrative debt includes, but is not limited to, a debt based on fines, penalties, and overpayments, but does not include a debt based on the extension of Government credit, such as those arising from loans and loan guaranties. The cost of living adjustment is the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the debt was determined or last adjusted. Such increases to administrative debts shall be computed annually.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Priority.</E> When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts received shall be applied first to outstanding penalties, second to administrative charges, third to interest, and last to principal.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Waiver.</E> (1) The Secretary shall waive the collection of interest and administrative charges imposed pursuant to this section on the portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue. The Secretary may extend this 30-day period on a case-by-case basis if the Secretary determines that such action is in the best interest of the Government, or otherwise warranted by equity and good conscience.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary also may waive interest, penalties, and administrative charges charged under this section, in whole or in part, without regard to the amount of the debt, based on:</P>
              <P>(i) The criteria set forth at § 30.22(a)(1) through (4) for the compromise of debts; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A determination by the Secretary that collection of these charges is:</P>
              <P>(A) Against equity and good conscience; or</P>
              <P>(B) Not in the best interest of the United States.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Review.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, administrative review of a debt will not suspend the assessment of interest, penalties, and administrative costs. While agency review of a debt is pending, the debtor either may pay the debt or be liable for interest and related charges on the uncollected debt. When agency review results in a final determination that any amount was properly a debt and the debtor chose to retain the amount in dispute, the Secretary shall collect from the debtor the amount determined to be due, plus interest, penalties and administrative costs on such debt amount, as calculated under this section, starting from the date the debtor was first made aware of the debt and ending when the debt is repaid.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Interest, penalties, and administrative cost charges will not be imposed on a debt for periods during which collection activity has been suspended under § 30.29(c)(1) pending agency review or consideration of waiver if statute prohibits collection of the debt during this period.<PRTPAGE P="100"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Common law or other statutory authority.</E> The Department may impose and waive interest and related charges on debts not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 in accordance with the common law or other statutory authority.</P>

Data on costs and corresponding recovery rates for debts of different types and in various dollar ranges will be used to compare the cost effectiveness of alternative collection techniques, establish guidelines with respect to points at which costs of further collection efforts are likely to exceed recoveries, assist in evaluating offers in compromise, and establish minimum debt amounts below which collection efforts need not be taken.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope and application.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> The standards set forth in this subpart apply to the compromise of debts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711. The Secretary may exercise such compromise authority for debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, the Department when the amount of the debt then due, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000, or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Application.</E> Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, the authority to accept a compromise rests with Justice. The Secretary shall evaluate the compromise offer, using the factors set forth in this subpart. If an offer to compromise any debt in excess of $100,000 is acceptable to the Department, the Secretary shall refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in Justice using a Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR), which may be obtained from Justice's National Central Intake Facility. The referral shall include appropriate financial information and a recommendation for the acceptance of the compromise offer. Justice approval is not required if the Secretary rejects a compromise offer.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 30.22</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Bases for compromise.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Compromise.</E> The Secretary may compromise a debt if the full amount cannot be collected based upon inability to pay, inability to collect the full debt, cost of collection, or doubt debt can be proven in court.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Inability to pay.</E> The debtor is unable to pay the full amount in a reasonable time, as verified through credit reports or other financial information. In determining a debtor's inability to pay the full amount of the debt within a reasonable time, the Secretary will obtain and verify the debtor's claim of inability to pay by using credit reports or a current financial Statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The Secretary may use a Departmental financial information form or may request suitable forms from Justice or the local United States Attorney's Office. The Secretary also may consider other relevant factors such as:</P>
              <P>(i) Age and health of the debtor;</P>
              <P>(ii) Present and potential income;</P>
              <P>(iii) Inheritance prospects;</P>
              <P>(iv) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor; and</P>
              <P>(v) The availability of assets or income that may be realized by enforced collection proceedings.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inability to collect full debt.</E> The Government is unable to collect the <PRTPAGE P="101"/>debt in full within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings.</P>
              <P>(i) In determining the Government's ability to enforce collection, the Secretary will consider the applicable exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law, and may also consider uncertainty as to the price the collateral or other property will bring at a forced sale.</P>
              <P>(ii) A compromise effected under this section should be for an amount that bears a reasonable relation to the amount that can be recovered by enforced collection procedures, with regard to the exemptions available to the debtor and the time that collection will take.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Cost of collection.</E> The cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount.</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary may compromise a debt if the cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount accepted in compromise of such cases may reflect an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigation costs of collection, with consideration given to the time it will take to effect collection. Collection costs may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small debts.</P>
              <P>(ii) In determining whether the costs of collection justify enforced collection of the full amount, the Secretary will consider whether continued collection of the debt, regardless of cost, is necessary to further an enforcement principal, such as the Government's willingness to pursue aggressively defaulting and uncooperative debtors.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Doubt debt can be proven in court.</E> There is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court.</P>
              <P>(i) If there is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed, either because of the legal issues involved or because of a bona fide dispute as to the facts, then the amount accepted in compromise of such cases should fairly reflect the probabilities of successful prosecution to judgment, with due regard to the availability of witnesses and other evidentiary support for the Government's claim.</P>
              <P>(ii) In determining the litigation risks involved, the Secretary will consider the probable amount of court costs and attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. 2412, that may be imposed against the Government if it is unsuccessful in litigation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Installments.</E> The Secretary generally will not accept compromises payable in installments. This is not an advantageous form of compromise in terms of time and administrative expense. If, however, payment of a compromise in installments is necessary, the Secretary shall, except in the case of compromises based on paragraph (a)(4) of this section, obtain a legally enforceable written agreement providing that, in the event of default, the full original principal balance of the debt prior to compromise, less sums paid thereon, is reinstated. The Office of the General Counsel should be consulted concerning the appropriateness of including such a requirement in the case of compromises based on paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Whenever possible, the Secretary will obtain security for repayment in the manner set forth in subpart B of this part.</P>

              <P>(b) The Secretary will ensure that a compromise agreement with one debtor does not automatically release the Department's claim against the remaining debtor(s).

In the event a mutual release is not executed when a debt is compromised, unless prohibited by law, the debtor is still deemed to have waived any and all claims and causes of action against the Government and its officials related to the transaction giving rise to the compromised debt.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> The standards set forth in this subpart apply to the suspension or termination of collection activity pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711 on debts that do not exceed $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if any. Prior to referring a debt to Justice for litigation, the Secretary may suspend or terminate collection under this subpart with respect to debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, the Department.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Application.</E> (1) If, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, the principal amount of the debt exceeds $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with Justice.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary believes that suspension or termination of any debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, the Secretary shall refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in Justice, using the CCLR. The referral will specify the reasons for the Secretary's recommendation. If, prior to referral to Justice, the Secretary determines that a debt is plainly erroneous or clearly without merit, the Secretary may terminate collection activity regardless of the amount involved without obtaining Justice concurrence.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 30.29</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Suspension of collection activity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> The Secretary may suspend collection activity on a debt when:</P>
              <P>(1) The Department cannot locate the debtor;</P>
              <P>(2) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or</P>
              <P>(3) The debtor has requested a waiver or review of the debt.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Financial condition.</E> Based on the current financial condition of a debtor, the Secretary may suspend collection <PRTPAGE P="103"/>activity on a debt when the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the debt for periodic review and collection activity, and:</P>
              <P>(1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired;</P>
              <P>(2) Future collection can be effected by administrative offset, notwithstanding the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for litigation of claims, with due regard to the 10-year limitation for administrative offset prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3716(e)(1); or</P>
              <P>(3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on which collection will be suspended, and such suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to pay the full amount of the principal of the debt with interest at a later date.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Waiver or review.</E> (1) The Secretary shall suspend collection activity during the time required for consideration of the debtor's request for waiver or administrative review of the debt if the statute under which the request is sought prohibits the Secretary from collecting the debt during that time.</P>
              <P>(2) If the statute under which the waiver or administrative review request is sought does not prohibit collection activity pending consideration of the request, the Secretary may use discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to suspend collection. Collection action ordinarily will be suspended upon a request for waiver or review if the Secretary is prohibited by statute or regulation from issuing a refund of amounts collected prior to agency consideration of the debtor's request. However, collection will not be suspended when the Secretary determines that the request for waiver or review is frivolous or was made primarily to delay collection.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Bankruptcy.</E> Upon learning that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, in most cases the Secretary must suspend collection activity on the debt, pursuant to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 362, 1201, and 1301, unless the Secretary can clearly establish that the automatic stay has been lifted or is no longer in effect. The Office of the General Counsel should be contacted immediately for legal advice, and the Secretary will take the necessary legal steps to ensure that no funds or money are paid by the Department to the debtor until relief from the automatic stay is obtained.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 30.30</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Termination of collection activity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Secretary may terminate collection activity when:</P>
              <P>(1) The Department is unable to collect any substantial amount through its own efforts or through the efforts of others;</P>
              <P>(2) The Department is unable to locate the debtor;</P>
              <P>(3) Costs of collection are anticipated to exceed the amount recoverable;</P>
              <P>(4) The debt is legally without merit or enforcement of the debt is barred by any applicable statute of limitations;</P>
              <P>(5) The debt cannot be substantiated; or</P>
              <P>(6) The debt against the debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Collection activity will not be terminated before the Secretary has pursued all appropriate means of collection and determined, based upon the results of the collection activity, that the debt is uncollectible.</P>
              <P>(2) Termination of collection activity ceases active collection of the debt. The termination of collection activity does not preclude the Secretary from retaining a record of the account for purposes of:</P>
              <P>(i) Selling the debt, if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that such sale is in the best interest of the United States;</P>
              <P>(ii) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes available;</P>
              <P>(iii) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the time of termination of collection activity; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Screening future applicants for prior indebtedness.</P>

              <P>(c) Generally, the Secretary shall terminate collection activity on a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy, regardless of the amount. The Secretary may continue collection activity, however, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, for any payments provided under a plan of reorganization. Offset and recoupment rights may survive the discharge of the debtor in bankruptcy and, under some <PRTPAGE P="104"/>circumstances, claims also may survive the discharge. For example, when the Department is a known creditor of a debtor the claims of the Department may survive a discharge if the Department did not receive formal notice of the bankruptcy proceedings. When the Department believes that it has claims or offsets that may have survived the discharge of the debtor, the Office of the General Counsel should be contacted for legal advice.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 30.31</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Exception to termination.</SUBJECT>
              <P>When a significant enforcement policy is involved, or recovery of a judgment is a prerequisite to the imposition of administrative sanctions, the Secretary may refer debts to Justice for litigation even though termination of collection activity may otherwise be appropriate.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 30.32</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Discharge of indebtedness; reporting requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) Before discharging a delinquent debt, also referred to as close out of the debt, the Secretary shall take all appropriate steps to collect the debt in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(g)(9), and parts 30 through 33 of this chapter, including, as applicable, administrative offset; tax refund offset; Federal salary offset; credit bureau reporting; administrative wage garnishment; litigation; foreclosure; and referral to Treasury, Treasury-designated debt collection centers, or private collection contractors.</P>
              <P>(2) Discharge of indebtedness is distinct from termination or suspension of collection activity under this subpart, and is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. When collection action on a debt is suspended or terminated, the debt remains delinquent and further collection action may be pursued at a later date in accordance with the standards set forth in this part and 31 CFR parts 900 through 904.</P>
              <P>(3) When the Department discharges a debt in full or in part, further collection action is prohibited. Therefore, before discharging a debt, the Secretary must:</P>
              <P>(i) Make the determination that collection action is no longer warranted; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Terminate debt collection action.</P>
              <P>(b) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(i), the Secretary shall use competitive procedures to sell a delinquent debt upon termination of collection action if the Secretary of the Treasury determines such a sale is in the best interests of the United States. Since the discharge of a debt precludes any further collection action, including the sale of a delinquent debt, the Secretary may not discharge a debt until the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3711(i) have been meet.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon discharge of an indebtedness, the Secretary must report the discharge to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1. The Secretary may request that Treasury or Treasury-designated debt collection centers file such a discharge report to the IRS on the Department's behalf.</P>
              <P>(d) When discharging a debt, the Secretary must request that litigation counsel release any liens of record securing the debt.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) The Secretary promptly shall refer to Justice for litigation debts on which aggressive collection activity has been taken in accordance with subpart B of this part, and that cannot be compromised, or on which collection activity cannot be suspended or terminated, in accordance with subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary may refer to Justice for litigation those debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, the Department.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Debts for which the principal amount is over $1,000,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs shall be referred to the Civil Division or other division responsible for litigating such debts at the Department of Justice, Washington DC.</P>

              <P>(2) Debts for which the principal amount is $1,000,000 or less, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs shall <PRTPAGE P="105"/>be referred to the Nationwide Central Intake Facility at Justice as required by the CCLR instructions.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Consistent with aggressive agency collection activity and the standards contained in this part and 31 CFR parts 900 through 904, debts shall be referred to Justice as early as possible, and, in any event, well within the period for initiating timely lawsuits against the debtors.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary shall make every effort to refer delinquent debts to Justice for litigation within one year of the date such debts last became delinquent. In the case of guaranteed or insured loans, the Secretary will make every effort to refer these delinquent debts to Justice for litigation within one year from the date the loan was presented to the Department for payment or re-insurance.</P>
              <P>(d) Justice has exclusive jurisdiction over debts referred to it pursuant to this subpart. Upon referral of a debt to Justice, the Secretary shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Immediately terminate the use of any administrative collection activities to collect the debt;</P>
              <P>(2) Advise Justice of the collection activities utilized to date, and their result; and</P>
              <P>(3) Refrain from having any contact with the debtor and direct all debtor inquiries concerning the debt to Justice.</P>
              <P>(e) After referral of a debt under this subpart, the Secretary shall immediately notify the Department of Justice of any payments credited by the Department to the debtor's account. Pursuant to 31 CFR 904.1(b), after referral of the debt under this subpart, Justice shall notify the Secretary of any payment received from the debtor.</P>

              <P>(2) The Secretary shall complete all of the sections of the CCLR appropriate to each debt as required by the CCLR instructions, and furnish such other information as may be required in specific cases.</P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary shall indicate clearly on the CCLR the actions that the Department wishes Justice to take with respect to the referred debt. The Secretary may indicate specifically any of a number of litigation activities which Justice may pursue, including enforced collection, judgement lien only, renew judgement lien only, renew judgement lien and enforced collection, program enforcement, foreclosure only, and foreclosure and deficiency judgment.</P>
              <P>(c) The Secretary also shall use the CCLR to refer a debt to Justice for the purpose of obtaining approval of a proposal to compromise the debt, or to suspend or terminate administrative collection activity of the debt.</P>

              <P>(b) The Secretary shall not refer claims of less than the minimum amount unless:</P>
              <P>(1) Litigation to collect such smaller amount is important to ensure compliance with the policies and programs of the Department;</P>
              <P>(2) The claim is being referred solely for the purpose of securing a judgment against the debtor, which will be filed as a lien against the debtor's property pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 3201 and returned to the Department for enforcement; or</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requesting a review.</E> (1) If the debtor believes that all or part of the debt <PRTPAGE P="109"/>is not past-due or not legally enforceable, the debtor may request a review by the Department by sending a written request to the address provided in the notice.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority.</E> These standards and procedures are authorized under the wage garnishment provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, codified at 31 U.S.C. 3720D, and the Department of the Treasury Administrative Wage Garnishment Regulations at 31 CFR 285.11.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (1) This part applies to all Departmental Operating Divisions and Regional Offices that administer a program that gives rise to a delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States and to all officers or employees of the Department authorized to collect such debt.</P>

            <P>(3) Nothing in this part precludes the compromise of a debt or the suspension or termination of collection action in accordance with part 30 of this title, or other applicable law or regulation.</P>
            <P>(4) The receipt of payments pursuant to this part does not preclude the Department from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset of Federal payments to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States.

            <SUBJECT>Hearing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Upon timely written request of the debtor, the Secretary shall provide a hearing, which at the Department's option may be oral or written, concerning the existence or amount of the debt, or the terms of a repayment schedule established other than by written agreement under § 32.4(a)(3)(ii).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Request for hearing.</E> (1) The request for a hearing must be signed by the debtor, state each issue being disputed, and identify and explain with reasonable specificity all facts and evidence that the debtor believes supports the debtor's position. Supporting documentation identified by the debtor should be attached to the request.</P>
            <P>(2) Effect of timely request. Subject to paragraph (j) of this section, if the debtor's written request is received on or before the 15th business day following the mailing of the written notice required under this part, a withholding order shall not be issued under § 32.6 until the debtor has been provided the requested hearing and a decision in accordance with paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section has been rendered.</P>

            <P>(3) Failure to timely request a hearing. If the debtor's written request is received after the 15th business day following the mailing of the written notice required under this part, the Secretary shall provide a hearing to the debtor. However, the Secretary shall not delay the issuance of a withholding order unless the Secretary determines that the delay in submitting such request was caused by factors beyond the control of the debtor, or the Secretary receives information that the Secretary determines justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order.<PRTPAGE P="112"/>

            <P>(2) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes the existence or amount of the debt, the debtor must present by a preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists or that the amount is incorrect. When challenging the terms of a repayment schedule, the debtor must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause financial hardship to the debtor, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Record.</E> The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of any hearing provided under this part. A hearing is not required to be a formal evidentiary-type hearing, but witnesses who testify in an oral hearing must do so under oath or affirmation.</P>

            <P>(i) A withholding order may not be issued until the hearing is held and a decision is rendered; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A withholding order previously issued to the debtor's employer must be suspended beginning on the 61st day after the receipt of the hearing request and continuing until a hearing is held and a decision is rendered.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Content of decision.</E> The written decision shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) A summary of the facts presented;</P>
            <P>(2) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and</P>
            <P>(3) The terms of any repayment schedule, if applicable.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Final agency action.</E> The hearing official's decision will be the final agency action for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. 701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
            </P>

            <P>(a) After receipt of a withholding order issued under this part, the employer shall deduct from all disposable pay paid to the debtor during each pay period the amount of garnishment described in paragraph (b) of this section.

            <P>(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, when a debtor's pay is subject to multiple withholding orders, unless otherwise provided by Federal law, withholding orders issued pursuant to this part shall have priority over other withholding orders that are served later in time.</P>
            <P>(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, withholding orders for family support shall have priority over withholding orders issued under this part.</P>
            <P>(3) If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order issued pursuant to this part, or if a withholding order for family support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld pursuant to a withholding order issued under this part shall be the lesser of:</P>
            <P>(i) The amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this section, or</P>
            <P>(ii) An amount equal to 25% of the debtor's disposable pay less the amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with priority.</P>
            <P>(d) If the debtor owes more than one debt to the Department, the Secretary may issue multiple withholding orders provided that the total amount garnished from the debtor's pay for such orders does not exceed the amount set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of the debtor.</P>
            <P>(f) The employer shall promptly pay to the Department all amounts withheld in accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to this part.</P>
            <P>(g) The employer is not required to vary its normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order.</P>
            <P>(h) Any assignment or allotment by an employee shall be void to the extent it interferes with or prohibits execution of the withholding order issued under this part, except for any assignment or allotment made pursuant to a family support judgment or order.</P>
            <P>(i) The employer shall withhold the appropriate amount from the debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives notification from the Secretary to discontinue wage withholding.</P>
            <P>(j) The withholding order, SF-329B “Wage Garnishment Order,” sent to the employer under § 32.6, requires the employer to commence wage withholding on the first pay day after the employer receives the order. However, if the first pay day is within 10 days after receipt of the order, the employer may begin deductions on the second pay day.</P>
            <P>(k) An employer may not discharge, refuse to employ, or take disciplinary action against any debtor as a result of the issuance of a withholding order under this part.</P>

            <P>(a) A debtor whose wages are subject to a withholding order may, at any <PRTPAGE P="114"/>time, request a review by the Department of the amount garnished, based on materially changed circumstances such as disability, divorce, or catastrophic illness which result in financial hardship.</P>

The Secretary shall consider any information submitted in accordance with this part.</P>
            <P>(c) If a financial hardship is found, the Secretary shall downwardly adjust, by an amount and for a period of time established by the Secretary, the amount garnished to reflect the debtor's financial condition. The Secretary will notify the employer of any adjustments to the amount to be withheld.</P>

            <P>(a) The employer of a debtor subject to wage withholding pursuant to this part shall pay to the Department as directed in a withholding order issued under this part.</P>
            <P>(b) The Secretary may bring suit against an employer for any amount that the employer fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to a debtor in accordance with §§ 32.6 and 32.8, plus attorney's fees, costs, and, if applicable, punitive damages.</P>
            <P>(c) A suit under this section may not be filed before the termination of the collection action involving a particular debtor, unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid expiration of any applicable statute of limitations period. For purposes of this section, “termination of collection action” occurs when the Secretary has terminated collection action in accordance with part 30 of this title, or other applicable law or regulation.</P>
            <P>(d) Notwithstanding deemed to occur if from a debtor whose paragraph (c) of this section, termination of the collection action will be a period of one (1) year the Department does not receive any payments wages were subject to a garnishment order issued under this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Hearings.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Petitions for hearing.</E> (1) To request a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the offset schedule established by the Department, the employee must send a written petition to the office designated in the notice of intent to offset, see § 33.4(a)(10), within 15 days of receipt of the notice.</P>
            <P>(2) The petition must:</P>
            <P>(i) Be signed by the employee;</P>
            <P>(ii) Fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses, if any, that the employee believes support his or her position; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Specify whether an oral or paper hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is requested, the request should explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone.</P>
            <P>(3) The timely filing of a petition for hearing shall stay any further collection proceedings.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Failure to timely request.</E> (1) If the petition for hearing is filed after the 15-day period provided for in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary may grant the request if the employee can establish that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond the employee's control, or that the employee failed to receive actual notice of the filing deadline.</P>
            <P>(2) An employee waives the right to a hearing, and will have his or her disposable pay offset in accordance with the offset schedule established by the Department, if the employee:</P>
            <P>(i) Fails to file a timely request for a hearing, unless such failure is excused; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Fails to appear at an oral hearing, of which the employee was notified, unless the hearing official determines that the failure to appear was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Form of hearings</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> After the employee requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will be oral, the notice shall set forth the date, time, and location of the hearing. If the hearing will be a review of the written record, the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit evidence and arguments in writing to the hearing official by a specified date, after which the record shall be closed. The date specified shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation.<PRTPAGE P="119"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Oral hearing.</E> An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone because an issue of credibility or veracity is involved. Where an oral hearing is appropriate, the hearing is not an adversarial adjudication and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing, i.e., the rules of evidence need not apply. <E T="03">Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not limited to:</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) Informal conferences with the hearing official in which the employee and agency representative will be given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and arguments;</P>
            <P>(ii) Informal meetings in which the hearing official interviews the employee; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Formal written submissions with an opportunity for oral presentations.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Paper hearing.</E> If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, the hearing official will make the determination based upon a review of the available written record.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Record.</E> The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of any hearing conducted under this part. Witnesses who testify in oral hearings will do so under oath or affirmation.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Written decision.</E> (1) Date of decision. The hearing officer shall issue a written opinion stating his or her decision, based upon documentary evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing, but not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which the hearing petition was received by the creditor agency, unless the employee requested a delay in the proceedings, in which case the 60-day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed. The recipient of an employee's request for a hearing must forward the request expeditiously to the Departmental Appeals Board so as to not jeopardize the Boards's ability to issue a decision within this 60-day period.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Content of decision.</E> The written decision shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;</P>
            <P>(ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions, including a determination whether the employee's petition for hearing was baseless and resulted from an intent to delay creditor agency collection activity; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The terms of any repayment schedule, if applicable.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Failure to appear.</E> In the absence of good cause shown, an employee who fails to appear at a hearing shall be deemed, for the purpose of this part, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent. If the representative of the creditor agency fails to appear, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled and make a determination based upon oral testimony presented and the documentary evidence submitted by both parties. With the agreement of both parties, the hearing official shall schedule a new hearing date, and both parties shall be given reasonable notice of the time and place of the new hearing.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Obtaining the services of a hearing official.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) When the Department is the creditor agency, the office designated in § 33.4(a)(10) shall schedule a hearing, if one is requested by an employee, before a hearing official.</P>
            <P>(2) When the Department cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before an administrative law judge or a hearing official furnished pursuant to another lawful arrangement, the office designated in § 33.4(a)(10) may:</P>
            <P>(i) When the debtor is not an employee of the Department, contact an agent of the employee's paying agency designated in 5 CFR part 581, appendix A, to arrange for a hearing official; or</P>
            <P>(ii) When the debtor is an employee of the Department, contact an agent of any agency designated in 5 CFR part 581, appendix A, to arrange for a hearing official.</P>

            <P>(b)(1) When another agency is the creditor agency, it is the responsibility of that agency to arrange for a hearing if one is requested. The Department will provide a hearing official upon the request of a creditor agency when the debtor is employed by the Department and the creditor agency cannot provide <PRTPAGE P="120"/>a prompt and appropriate hearing before a hearing official furnished pursuant to another lawful arrangement.</P>
            <P>(2) Services rendered to a creditor agency under paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be provided on a fully reimbursable basis pursuant to the Economy Act of 1932, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 1535.</P>
            <P>(c) The determination of a hearing official designated under this section is considered to be an official certification regarding the existence and amount of the debt for purposes of executing salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this part. A creditor agency may make a certification to the Secretary of the Treasury under 5 CFR 550.1108 or a paying agency under 5 CFR 550.1109 regarding the existence and amount of the debt based on the certification of a hearing official. If a hearing official determines that a debt may not be collected via salary offset, but the creditor agency finds that the debt is still valid, the creditor agency may still seek collection of the debt through other means, such as offset of other Federal payments or litigation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Voluntary repayment agreement in lieu of salary offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) In response to the notice of intent to offset, the employee may propose to establish an alternative schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt by submitting a written request to the Department official designated in the notice of intent to offset. An employee who wishes to repay the debt without salary offset shall also submit a proposed written repayment agreement. The proposal shall admit the existence of the debt, and the agreement must be in such form that it is legally enforceable. The agreement must:</P>
            <P>(i) Be in writing;</P>
            <P>(ii) Be signed by both the employee and the Department;</P>
            <P>(iii) Specify all the terms of the arrangement for payment; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Contain a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default by the employee, but such an increase may not result in a deduction that exceeds 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay unless the employee has agreed in writing to deduction of a greater amount.</P>
            <P>(2) Any proposal under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be received by the Department within 30 days of the date of the notice of intent to offset.</P>
            <P>(b) In response to a timely request as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the designated Department official shall notify the employee whether the proposed repayment schedule is acceptable. It is within the Secretary's discretion to accept a proposed alternative repayment schedule, and to set the necessary terms of a voluntary repayment agreement.</P>
            <P>(c) No voluntary repayment agreement will be binding on the Secretary unless it is in writing and signed by both the Secretary and the employee.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 33.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Special review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A Department employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement may, at any time, request a special review by the Secretary of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary repayment installments, based on materially changed circumstances, such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) In determining whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses, e.g., food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care, the employee shall submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the employee, his or her spouse, and dependents indicating:</P>
            <P>(i) Income from all sources;</P>
            <P>(ii) Assets and liabilities;</P>
            <P>(iii) Number of dependents;</P>
            <P>(iv) Food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical expenses; and</P>
            <P>(v) Exceptional and unusual expenses, if any.</P>
            <P>(2) When requesting a special review under this section, the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, stating why the current salary offset or payments result in an extreme financial hardship to the employee.</P>

            <P>(c)(1) The Secretary shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents, and determine whether the <PRTPAGE P="121"/>original offset or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the employee.</P>
            <P>(2) Within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the request and supporting documents, the Secretary shall notify the employee in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or repayment schedule.</P>
            <P>(d) If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the Secretary shall provide a new certification to the paying agency.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for salary offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Method and source of deductions.</E> Unless the employee and the Secretary have agreed to an alternative repayment arrangement under § 33.8, a debt shall be collected in lump sum or by installment deductions at officially established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitation on amount of deduction.</E> Ordinarily, the size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any pay period must not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount, as outlined in § 33.8.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Duration of deductions.</E> (1) Lump sum. If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, the debt generally will be collected in one lump-sum deduction.</P>
            <P>(2) If the employee is deemed financially unable to pay in one lump-sum or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, the debt shall be collected in installments. Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, installment deductions must be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of active duty or employment.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">When deductions may begin.</E> (1) Deductions will begin on the date stated in the notice of intent, unless an alternative repayment agreement under § 33.8 has been accepted or the employee has filed a timely request for a hearing.</P>
            <P>(2) If the employee files a timely petition for hearing as provided in § 33.6, deductions will begin after the hearing official has provided the employee with a hearing and a final written decision has been rendered in favor of the Department.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Liquidation from final check.</E> If an employee retires, resigns, or the period of employment ends before collection of the debt is completed, the remainder of the debt will be offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 from subsequent payments of any nature (e.g., final salary payment or lump-sum leave) due the employee from the paying agency as of the date of separation.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Recovery from other payments due a separated employee.</E> If the debt cannot be satisfied by offset from any final payment due the employee on the date of separation, the Secretary will liquidate the debt, where appropriate, by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 from later payments of any kind due the former employee (e.g., lump sum leave payment).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 33.11</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Salary offset when the Department is the creditor agency but not the paying agency.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Centralized administrative offset.</E> (1) Under 31 U.S.C. 3716, the Department shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of all past-due, legally enforceable debts which are 180 days delinquent for purposes of collection by centralized administrative offset. This includes debts which the Department seeks to recover from the pay account of an employee of another agency via salary offset. The Secretary of the Treasury and other Federal disbursing officials will match payments, including Federal salary payments, against these debts. Where a match occurs, and all the requirements for offset have been met, the payments will be offset to collect the debt.</P>

            <P>(2) Prior to offset of the pay account of an employee, the Department must comply with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514; 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and this part. Specific procedures for notifying the Secretary of the Treasury of a debt for purposes of collection <PRTPAGE P="122"/>by administrative offset, including salary offset, are contained in 31 CFR parts 285 and 901 and part 30 of this title.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Non-centralized administrative offset.</E> When salary offset through centralized administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section is not possible, the Department may attempt to collect a debt through non-centralized administrative offset in accordance with part 30 of this title.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Format of the request.</E> Upon completion of the procedures established in this part and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Department shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Certify in writing to the paying agency that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment(s) is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, and that the Departmental regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the collection is to be made in installments, advise the paying agency of the number of installments to be collected, the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment, and the commencement date of the installments, if a date other than the next officially established pay period is required.</P>
            <P>(iii) Unless the employee has consented in writing to the salary deductions or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures and this written consent or statement is forwarded to the paying agency, advise the paying agency of the action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this part, and give the date(s) the action(s) was taken.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Requesting recovery from current paying agency.</E> (i) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the Department shall submit a certified debt claim containing the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and an installment agreement, or other instruction on the payment schedule, if applicable, to the employee's paying agency.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the employee is in the process of separating from the Federal Government, the Department shall submit the certified debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection as provided in § 33.10(e). The paying agency must certify the total amount of its collection on the debt and send a copy of the certification to the employee and another copy to the Department. If the paying agency's collection does not fully satisfy the debt, and the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments that may be due the employee from other Federal Government sources, the paying agency will provide written notification of the outstanding debt to the agency responsible for making such payments to the employee, stating the employee owes a debt, the amount of the debt, and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. The Department must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before the collection can be made.</P>
            <P>(iii) If the employee is already separated and all payments due from the employee's former paying agency have been paid, the Department may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801 or 5 CFR 845.401) or other similar funds, be administratively offset to collect the debt. See 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 31 CFR 901.3.</P>
            <P>(iv) If the employee transfers to another paying agency, the Department must submit a properly certified debt claim to the new paying agency before collection can be resumed; however, the Department need not repeat the due process procedures described in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this part. The Department shall review the debt to ensure that collection is resumed by the new paying agency.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Format of the request.</E> (1) When the Department is the paying agency and another agency is the creditor agency, the creditor agency must certify, in writing, to the Department that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which <PRTPAGE P="123"/>payment(s) is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, and that the creditor agency's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management.</P>
            <P>(2) If the collection is to be made in installments, the creditor agency must also advise the Department of the number of installments to be collected, the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment, and the commencement date of the installments, if a date other than the next officially established pay period is required.</P>
            <P>(3) Unless the employee has consented in writing to the salary deductions or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures and the written consent or statement is forwarded to the Department, the creditor agency must advise the Department of the action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. § 5514, and give the date(s) the action(s) was taken.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Requests for recovery.</E> (1) Complete claim. When the Department receives a properly certified debt claim from a creditor agency, deductions should be scheduled to begin prospectively at the next officially established pay interval. The employee must receive written notice as described in § 33.10 that the Department has received a certified debt claim from the creditor agency, including the amount, and written notice of the date deductions from salary will commence and the amount of such deductions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Incomplete claim.</E> When the Department receives an incomplete debt claim from a creditor agency, the Secretary shall return the debt claim with a notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, must be provided and a properly certified debt claim received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Review.</E> The Secretary is not required or authorized to review the merits of the determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Employees separating.</E> If an employee begins separation action before the Department collects the total debt due the creditor agency, the following actions will be taken:</P>
            <P>(1) To the extent possible, the balance owed the creditor agency will be liquidated from a final salary check, or other final payments of any nature due the employee from the Department;</P>
            <P>(2) The Secretary will certify the total amount of the Department's collection on the debt and send a copy of the certification to the employee and another copy to the creditor agency; and</P>
            <P>(3) If the Department's collection does not fully satisfy the debt, and the Secretary is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments that may be due the employee from other Federal Government sources, the Secretary will provide written notification of the outstanding debt to the agency responsible for making such payments to the employee. The written notification shall state that the employee owes a debt, the amount of the debt, and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. The Department shall furnish a copy of this written notification to the creditor agency so that it can file a properly certified debt claim with the agency responsible for making such payments.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Employees who transfer to another paying agency.</E> If, after the creditor agency has submitted a debt claim to the Department, the employee transfers from the Department to a different paying agency before the debt is collected in full, the Secretary shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt; and</P>
            <P>(2) Furnish a copy of the certification to the employee and another copy to the creditor agency along with notice of the employee's transfer.</P>

Nothing in this part shall be construed to bar other types of claims that are payable under other statutory authority such as, but not limited to, the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. 2671-2680).</P>

It shall be filed before or concurrent with submitting a claim against the government under this part.</P>

            <P>(a) The Department of Health and Human Services may indemnify, in whole or in part, its employees (which for the purpose of this regulation includes former employees) for any verdict, judgment or other monetary award which is rendered against any such employee, provided that the conduct giving rise to the verdict, judgment or award was taken within the scope of his or her employment with the Department and that such indemnification is in the interest of the United States, as determined by the Secretary, or his or her designee, in his or her discretion.</P>
            <P>(b) The Department of Health and Human Services may settle or compromise a personal damage claim against its employee by the payment of available funds, at any time, provided the alleged conduct giving rise to the personal damage claim was taken within the scope of employment and that such settlement or compromise is in the interest of the United States, as determined by the Secretary, or his or her designee, in his or her discretion.</P>
            <P>(c) Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Secretary or his or her designee, the Department will not entertain a request either to agree to indemnify or to settle a personal damage claim before entry of an adverse verdict, judgment or monetary award.</P>
            <P>(d) When an employee of the Department of Health and Human Services becomes aware that an action has been filed against the employee in his or her individual capacity as a result of conduct taken within the scope of his or her employment, the employee should immediately notify the Department that such an action is pending.</P>
            <P>(e) The employee may, thereafter, request either (1) indemnification to satisfy a verdict, judgment or award entered against the employee or (2) payment to satisfy the requirements of a settlement proposal. The employee shall submit a written request, with documentation including copies of the verdict, judgment, award or settlement proposal, as appropriate, to the head of his employing component, who shall thereupon submit to the General Counsel, in a timely manner, a recommended disposition of the request. The General Counsel shall also seek the views of the Department of Justice. The General Counsel shall forward the request, the employing component's recommendation and the General Counsel's recommendation to the Secretary for decision.</P>
            <P>(f) Any payment under this section either to indemnify a Department of Health and Human Services employee or to settle a personal damage claim shall be contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds of the employing component of the Department of Health and Human Services.</P>

              <P>(a) Each institution engaged in research that is covered by this policy, with the exception of research eligible for exemption under § 46.104, and that is conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements of this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, and approved for Federal-wide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office. Federal departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has provided an assurance that it will comply with the requirements of this policy, as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB (if such certification is required by § 46.103(d)).</P>

              <P>(d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this policy:</P>
              <P>(1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.</P>
              <P>(2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
              <P>(i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
              <P>(ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 46.111(a)(7).</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
              <P>(A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
              <P>(B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
              <P>(C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 46.111(a)(7).</P>

              <P>(ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such <PRTPAGE P="139"/>criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.</P>
              <P>(4) Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
              <P>(i) The identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are publicly available;</P>
              <P>(ii) Information, which may include information about biospecimens, is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, the investigator does not contact the subjects, and the investigator will not re-identify subjects;</P>
              <P>(iii) The research involves only information collection and analysis involving the investigator's use of identifiable health information when that use is regulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, for the purposes of “health care operations” or “research” as those terms are defined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for “public health activities and purposes” as described under 45 CFR 164.512(b); or</P>

              <P>(iv) The research is conducted by, or on behalf of, a Federal department or agency using government-generated or government-collected information obtained for nonresearch activities, if the research generates identifiable private information that is or will be maintained on information technology that is subject to and in compliance with section 208(b) of the E-Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note, if all of the identifiable private information collected, used, or generated as part of the activity will be maintained in systems of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and, if applicable, the information used in the research was collected subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E>

Such projects include, but are not limited to, internal studies by Federal employees, and studies under contracts or consulting arrangements, cooperative agreements, or grants. Exempt projects also include waivers of otherwise mandatory requirements using authorities such as sections 1115 and 1115A of the Social Security Act, as amended.</P>
              <P>(i) Each Federal department or agency conducting or supporting the research and demonstration projects must establish, on a publicly accessible Federal Web site or in such other manner as the department or agency head may determine, a list of the research and demonstration projects that the Federal department or agency conducts or supports under this provision. The research or demonstration project must be published on this list prior to commencing the research involving human subjects.</P>

              <P>(a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and agencies and after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for public comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk;</P>
              <P>(ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption under § 46.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).</P>
              <P>(2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in § 46.108(b).</P>
              <P>(c) Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals that have been approved under the procedure.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria for IRB approval of research.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:</P>
              <P>(1) Risks to subjects are minimized:</P>
              <P>(i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.</P>

              <P>(2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.</P>

              <P>(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. <PRTPAGE P="143"/>The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.</P>
              <P>(4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, § 46.116.</P>
              <P>(5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented or appropriately waived in accordance with § 46.117.</P>
              <P>(6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.</P>
              <P>(7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget's privacy office and other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, issue guidance to assist IRBs in assessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by § 46.104(d)(7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the following determinations:</P>
              <P>(i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in accordance with the requirements of § 46.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);</P>
              <P>(ii) Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate, in accordance with § 46.117; and</P>
              <P>(iii) If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
              <P>(b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written informed consent form approved by the IRB and signed (including in an electronic format) by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A written copy shall be given to the person signing the informed consent form.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the informed consent form may be either of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of § 46.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.</P>

              <P>(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the elements of informed consent required by § 46.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the key information required by § 46.116(a)(5)(i) was <PRTPAGE P="149"/>presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds any of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;</P>
              <P>(ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or</P>
              <P>(iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.</P>
              <P>(2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement regarding the research.</P>

              <P>(ii) The purpose of the research is the development of important biomedical knowledge which cannot be obtained by other means and there will be no added risk to the neonate resulting from the research; and</P>
              <P>(2) The legally effective informed consent of either parent of the neonate or, if neither parent is able to consent because of unavailability, incompetence, or temporary incapacity, the legally effective informed consent of either parent's legally authorized representative is obtained in accord with subpart A of this part, except that the consent of the father or his legally authorized representative need not be obtained if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Nonviable neonates.</E> After delivery nonviable neonate may not be involved in research covered by this subpart unless all of the following additional conditions are met:</P>

              <P>(5) The legally effective informed consent of both parents of the neonate is obtained in accord with subpart A of this part, except that the waiver and alteration provisions of § 46.116(c) and (d) do not apply. However, if either parent is unable to consent because of unavailability, incompetence, or temporary incapacity, the informed consent of one parent of a nonviable neonate will suffice to meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(5), except that the consent of the father need not be obtained if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. The consent of a legally authorized representative of either or both of the parents of a nonviable neonate will not suffice to meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(5).</P>

              <P>(a) In addition to all other responsibilities prescribed for Institutional Review Boards under this part, the Board shall review research covered by this subpart and approve such research only if it finds that:</P>
              <P>(1) The research under review represents one of the categories of research permissible under § 46.306(a)(2);</P>
              <P>(2) Any possible advantages accruing to the prisoner through his or her participation in the research, when compared to the general living conditions, medical care, quality of food, amenities and opportunity for earnings in the prison, are not of such a magnitude that his or her ability to weigh the risks of the research against the value of such advantages in the limited choice environment of the prison is impaired;</P>
              <P>(3) The risks involved in the research are commensurate with risks that would be accepted by nonprisoner volunteers;</P>
              <P>(4) Procedures for the selection of subjects within the prison are fair to all prisoners and immune from arbitrary intervention by prison authorities or prisoners. Unless the principal investigator provides to the Board justification in writing for following some other procedures, control subjects must be selected randomly from the group of available prisoners who meet the characteristics needed for that particular research project;</P>
              <P>(5) The information is presented in language which is understandable to the subject population;</P>
              <P>(6) Adequate assurance exists that parole boards will not take into account a prisoner's participation in the research in making decisions regarding parole, and each prisoner is clearly informed in advance that participation in the research will have no effect on his or her parole; and</P>
              <P>(7) Where the Board finds there may be a need for follow-up examination or care of participants after the end of their participation, adequate provision has been made for such examination or care, taking into account the varying lengths of individual prisoners' sentences, and for informing participants of this fact.</P>
              <P>(b) The Board shall carry out such other duties as may be assigned by the Secretary.</P>

              <P>(a) Biomedical or behavioral research conducted or supported by DHHS may involve prisoners as subjects only if:</P>
              <P>(1) The institution responsible for the conduct of the research has certified to the Secretary that the Institutional Review Board has approved the research under § 46.305 of this subpart; and</P>
              <P>(2) In the judgment of the Secretary the proposed research involves solely the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Study of the possible causes, effects, and processes of incarceration, and of criminal behavior, provided that the study presents no more than minimal risk and no more than inconvenience to the subjects;</P>

              <P>(ii) Study of prisons as institutional structures or of prisoners as incarcerated persons, provided that the study <PRTPAGE P="155"/>presents no more than minimal risk and no more than inconvenience to the subjects;</P>

              <P>(iii) Research on conditions particularly affecting prisoners as a class (for example, vaccine trials and other research on hepatitis which is much more prevalent in prisons than elsewhere; and research on social and psychological problems such as alcoholism, drug addiction and sexual assaults) provided that the study may proceed only after the Secretary has consulted with appropriate experts including experts in penology medicine and ethics, and published notice, in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> of his intent to approve such research; or</P>

              <P>(iv) Research on practices, both innovative and accepted, which have the intent and reasonable probability of improving the health or well-being of the subject. In cases in which those studies require the assignment of prisoners in a manner consistent with protocols approved by the IRB to control groups which may not benefit from the research, the study may proceed only after the Secretary has consulted with appropriate experts, including experts in penology medicine and ethics, and published notice, in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> of his intent to approve such research.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requirements for permission by parents or guardians and for assent by children.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In addition to the determinations required under other applicable sections of this subpart, the IRB shall determine that adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children, when in the judgment of the IRB the children are capable of providing assent. In determining whether children are capable of assenting, the IRB shall take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological state of the children involved. This judgment may be made for all children to be involved in research under a particular protocol, or for each child, as the IRB deems appropriate. If the IRB determines that the capability of some or all of the children is so limited that they cannot reasonably be consulted or that the intervention or procedure involved in the research holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health or well-being of the children and is available only in the context of the research, the assent of the children is not a necessary condition for proceeding with the research. Even where the IRB determines that the subjects are capable of assenting, the IRB may still waive the assent requirement under circumstances in which consent may be waived in accord with § 46.116 of subpart A.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the determinations required under other applicable sections of this subpart, the IRB shall determine, in accordance with and to the extent that consent is required by § 46.116 of subpart A, that adequate provisions are made for soliciting the permission of each child's parents or guardian. Where parental permission is to be obtained, the IRB may find that the permission of one parent is sufficient for research to be conducted under § 46.404 or § 46.405. Where research is covered by §§ 46.406 and 46.407 and permission is to be obtained from parents, both parents must give their permission unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to the provisions for waiver contained in § 46.116 of subpart A, if the IRB determines that a research protocol is designed for conditions or for a subject population for which parental or guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the subjects (for example, neglected or abused children), it may waive the consent requirements in subpart A of this part and paragraph (b) of this section, provided an appropriate mechanism for protecting the children who will participate as subjects in the research is substituted, and provided further that the waiver is not inconsistent with Federal, state or local law. The choice of an appropriate mechanism would depend upon the nature and purpose of the activities described in the protocol, the risk and anticipated benefit to the research subjects, and their age, maturity, status, and condition.</P>
              <P>(d) Permission by parents or guardians shall be documented in accordance with and to the extent required by § 46.117 of subpart A.</P>
              <P>(e) When the IRB determines that assent is required, it shall also determine whether and how assent must be documented.</P>

              <P>(1) Related to their status as wards; or</P>
              <P>(2) Conducted in schools, camps, hospitals, institutions, or similar settings in which the majority of children involved as subjects are not wards.</P>

              <P>(b) If the research is approved under paragraph (a) of this section, the IRB shall require appointment of an advocate for each child who is a ward, in addition to any other individual acting on behalf of the child as guardian or in loco parentis. One individual may serve as advocate for more than one child. The advocate shall be an individual who has the background and experience to act in, and agrees to act in, the best interests of the child for the duration of the child's participation in the research and who is not associated in any way (except in the role as advocate or member of the IRB) with the research, <PRTPAGE P="158"/>the investigator(s), or the guardian organization.</P>

            <P>Under the authority of Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (75 Stat. 527) and the Immigration and Nationality Act as amended (84 Stat. 116), the Department of Health and Human Services is an “interested United States Government agency” with the authority to request the Department of State to recommend to the Attorney General waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement for Exchange Visitors under the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Program. HHS eligibility requirement criteria for waivers are in addition to and independent of the existing waiver and visa criteria established by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the Department of State, and the Department of Labor. The waiver regulations described in this part do not relieve alien physicians seeking a waiver of the 2-year foreign residence requirement from complying with the terms and conditions imposed on their admission to the United States.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Functions.</E> The Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board is responsible for making thorough and equitable evaluations of applications submitted by institutions, acting on behalf of Exchange Visitors, to HHS for a favorable recommendation to the Department of State that the two-year foreign residence requirement for Exchange Visitors under the Exchange Visitor Program be waived.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Membership.</E> The Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board consists of no fewer than three members and two alternates, of whom no fewer than three will consider any particular application. The Director of the Office of Global Health Affairs, Office of the Secretary, is an ex officio member of the Board and serves as its Chairman. The Director may designate a staff member of the Office of the Secretary to serve as member and Chairman of the Board in the Director's absence. The Assistant Secretary for Health appoints two regularly assigned members and two alternates to consider applications concerning health, biomedical research, and related fields. The Chairman may request the heads of operating divisions of the Department to appoint additional members to consider applications in other fields of interest to the Department. The Board may obtain expert advisory opinions from other sources. The Board may establish a workgroup from the operating divisions of the Department to consider applications for waivers based on the need for the delivery of health care services to underserved populations.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy for waivers.</E> The Department of Health and Human Services endorses the philosophy that Exchange Visitors are committed to return home for at least two years after completing their program. This requirement was imposed to prevent the Program from becoming a stepping stone to immigration and to ensure that Exchange Visitors make available to their home countries their new knowledge and skills obtained in the United States. The Department will request waivers for the delivery of health care service <PRTPAGE P="160"/>to carry out the Department's mission to increase access to care for the nation's most medically underserved individuals. However, in keeping with the philosophy of the Program, the Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board may determine the appropriate numbers and geographic areas for waivers for the delivery of health care service.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria for waivers.</E> The Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board carefully applies stringent and restrictive criteria to its consideration of requests that it support waivers for Exchange Visitors. Each application is evaluated individually based on the facts available.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Waiver for members of Exchange Visitor's family.</E> Where a decision is made to request a waiver for an Exchange Visitor, a waiver will also be requested for the spouse and children, if any, if they have J-2 visa status. When both members of a married couple are Exchange Visitors in their own right (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> each has J-1 visa status), separate applications must be submitted for each of them.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Waivers for research.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In determining whether to request a waiver for an Exchange Visitor engaged in the conduct of research, the Board considers the following key factors:</P>
            <P>(a) The program or activity at the applicant institution or organization in which the Exchange Visitor is employed must be of high priority and of national or international significance in an area of interest to the Department.</P>
            <P>(b) The Exchange Visitor must be needed as an integral part of the program or activity, or of an essential component thereof, so that loss of his/her services would necessitate discontinuance of the program, or a major phase of it. Specific evidence must be provided on how the loss or unavailability of the individual's services would adversely affect the initiation, continuance, completion, or success of the program or activity. The applicant organization/institution must clearly demonstrate that a suitable replacement for the Exchange Visitor cannot be found through recruitment or any other means. The Board will not request a waiver when the principal problem appears to be one of administrative, budgetary, or program inconvenience to the institution or other employer.</P>
            <P>(c) The Exchange Visitor must possess outstanding qualifications, training and experience well beyond the usually expected accomplishments at the graduate, postgraduate, and residency levels, and must clearly demonstrate the capability to make original and significant contributions to the program. The Board will not request a waiver simply because an individual has specialized training or experience or is occupying a senior staff position in a university, hospital, or other institution.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Waivers for the delivery of health care service.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In determining whether to request a waiver for an Exchange Visitor to deliver health care service, the Board will consider information from and coordinate with State Departments of Public Health (or the equivalent), other “interested government agencies” which request waivers, and other relevant agencies. The Board requires the following criteria for requests for waivers for the delivery of health care service:</P>
            <P>(a) The Exchange Visitor must submit a statement that he or she does not have pending and will not submit any other “interested government agency” waiver request while HHS processes the waiver request being submitted.</P>

            <P>(b) Waivers are limited to primary care physicians and general psychiatrists who have completed their primary care or psychiatric residency training programs no more than12 months before the date of commencement of employment under the contract described in subparagraph (d). This 12-month eligibility limitation is to ensure that the physicians' primary care training is current and they are not engaged in subspecialty training. This HHS eligibility requirement relates only to eligibility for an HHS waiver request and does not relieve physicians of the responsibility to <PRTPAGE P="161"/>maintain lawful status. Alien physicians are strongly encouraged to begin the waiver process as early as they possibly can while still in the residency training program. Early filing of the waiver request by the alien physician, coupled with timely processing of the request by the relevant government agencies, will facilitate the timely completion of the waiver process before the authorized J-1 admission expires, and the physician's subsequent application for change of nonimmigrant status from J-1 to H-1B.</P>
            <P>(c) Primary care physicians are defined as: physicians practicing general internal medicine, pediatrics, family practice or obstetrics/gynecology willing to work in a primary care Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) or Medically Underserved Area or Population (MUA/P); and general psychiatrists who are willing to work in a Mental Health HPSA. Note: these HHS eligibility criteria for waivers are in addition to and independent of the existing waiver and visa criteria established by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the Department of State, and the Department of Labor.</P>
            <P>(d) The Exchange Visitor must have entered a contract with the applicant employer. This contract must:</P>
            <P>(1) Require the Exchange Visitor to provide primary medical care in a facility physically located in an HHS-designated primary care HPSA or MUA/P, or general psychiatric care in a Mental Health HPSA.</P>
            <P>(2) Require the Exchange Visitor to complete a term of employment of not less than three years providing primary care health services for not less than 40 hours per week.</P>
            <P>(3) Require the Exchange Visitor to:</P>
            <P>(i) Be licensed by the State where he or she will practice;</P>
            <P>(ii) Have completed a residency in one of the following specialties: family practice, general pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, general internal medicine, or general psychiatry; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Be either board certified or board eligible in the relevant primary care discipline.</P>
            <P>(4) Be terminable only for cause until completion of the three-year commitment, except that, with the agreement of the alien physician, the employer may assign the contract to another eligible employer with the prior approval of HHS and compliance with all applicable INS and Department of Labor requirements. Prior to approving an assignment of the contract, HHS will review and consider the health care needs of the alien physician's current and proposed new locations, as well as the reasons for the request.</P>
            <P>(5) Not contain a restrictive covenant or non-compete clause which prevents or discourages the physician from continuing to practice in any HHS-designated primary care HPSA or MUA/P or Mental Health HPSA after the period of obligation under the contract has expired.</P>
            <P>(6) Provide that any amendment to the contract complies with all applicable Federal statutes, regulations and HHS policy.</P>
            <P>(7) Be consistent with all applicable Federal statutes, regulations and HHS policy.</P>
            <P>(e) The facility or practice sponsoring the physician:</P>
            <P>(1) Must provide health services to individuals without discriminating against them because either they are unable to pay for those services or payment for those health services will be made under Medicare or Medicaid.</P>
            <P>(2) May charge no more than the usual and customary rate prevailing in the geographic area in which the services are provided.</P>
            <P>(3) Must provide care on a sliding fee scale for persons at or below 200 percent of poverty income level. Persons with third-party insurance may be charged the full fee for service.</P>
            <P>(4) Must post a notice in a conspicuous location in the patient waiting area at the practice site to notify patients of the charges for service as required in this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(5) Must provide evidence that the applicant facility made unsuccessful efforts to recruit a physician who is a United States physician for the position to be filled by the Exchange Visitor.</P>

            <P>(6) Must provide a statement by the head of the facility to confirm the facility is located in a specific, designated HPSA or MUA/P, and that it provides medical care to Medicaid and <PRTPAGE P="162"/>Medicare eligible patients and to the uninsured indigent.</P>
            <P>(f) The employer and the alien physician must submit information to the Secretary at the times and in the manner that the Secretary may reasonably require.</P>

            <P>(a) The Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board will review applications submitted by private or non-federal institutions, organizations, or agencies or by a component agency of HHS. The Board will not accept applications submitted by Exchange Visitors or, unless under extenuating and exceptional circumstances, other U.S. Government Agencies.</P>
            <P>(b) Applications, instruction sheets and information are available from the Executive Secretary, Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board.

            <P>(a) It is <E T="03">not</E> within the Department's jurisdiction to consider applications for waiver based on:</P>
            <P>(1) Exceptional hardship to the exchange visitor's American or legally resident alien spouse or child; or</P>
            <P>(2) The alien's unwillingness to return to the country of his/her nationality or last residence on the grounds that he/she or family members would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion or political opinion.</P>
            <P>(b) Likewise, this Department is not responsible for considering requests to extend visas.</P>
            <P>(c) Inquiries concerning the above should be directed to the District Office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service which has jurisdiction over the exchange visitor's place of residence in the United States.</P>

Failure to comply with those conditions will make that physician subject to removal from the United States by the INS.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How will the plans be evaluated?</SUBJECT>
            <P>After consultation with the Federal Substantial Disruption Waiver Board (seven Federal representatives charged with the responsibility of reviewing substantial disruption waiver applications), the Secretary of Health and Human Services will make recommendations to the Director, United States Information Agency, for the purpose of granting waivers. The Secretary will consider the following factors in determining whether or not a plan is satisfactory:</P>
            <P>(a) The extent of the specific problems that the program or institution anticipates without a waiver, including, for example,</P>
            <P>(1) Curtailment of services currently provided,</P>
            <P>(2) Downgrading of medical care currently being provided,</P>
            <P>(3) Reduction in the number of inpatients and outpatients receiving care,</P>
            <P>(4) Inadequate medical coverage for population served, or</P>
            <P>(5) Inadequate supervision of junior residents.</P>
            <P>(b) The adequacy of the alternative resources and methods (including use of physician assistants (as defined in 42 CFR 57.802), nurse practitioners (as defined in 42 CFR 57.2402), and other non-physician providers) that have been considered and have been and will be applied to reduce such disruption in the delivery of health services, especially in primary medical care manpower shortage areas, as established under section 332 of the Public Health Service Act, and for medicaid patients. This may include, for example:</P>
            <P>(1) Greater reliance on fully licensed physicians, and on physician assistants, nurse practitioners and other non-physician personnel in an expanded role in the delivery of health care, such as admission patient histories, making patient rounds, recording patient progress notes, doing the initial and follow-up evaluation of patients, performing routine laboratory and related studies, or</P>
            <P>(2) Utilization of the team approach to health care delivery (individuals functioning as an integral part of an interprofessional team of health personnel organized under the leadership of a physician working toward more efficient and/or more effective delivery of health services).</P>
            <P>(c) The extent to which changes (including improvement of educational and medical services) have been considered and which have been or will be applied to make the program more attractive to graduates of medical schools who are citizens of the United States, as demonstrated, for example, by:</P>
            <P>(1) Adding additional services to the existing programs to provide a broader educational experience for residents,</P>

            <P>(2) Expanding affiliations with other residency programs to offer a broader experience for residents,<PRTPAGE P="164"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Expanding undergraduate clerkships to provide a broader educational experience.</P>
            <P>(4) Creating or modifying administrative units which will provide broader clinical experiences, or</P>
            <P>(5) Initiating research projects.</P>
            <P>(d) The adequacy of the recruitment efforts which have been and will be undertaken to attract graduates of medical schools who are citizens of the United States, as demonstrated, for example, by:</P>
            <P>(1) Broad-based advertisement of the program and of the institution through notices in journals, contacts with medical schools, etc.</P>
            <P>(2) Forming committees for the purpose of recruiting U.S. citizens.</P>
            <P>(3) Working with national organizations which are involved with medical students and U.S. graduate medical trainees, e.g., the American Medical Student Association and the Physician National House Staff Association, to attract U.S. citizens.</P>
            <P>(e) The extent to which the program on a year-by-year basis has phased down its dependence upon aliens who are graduates of foreign medical schools so that the program will not be dependent upon the admission to the program of any additional such aliens after December 31, 1983.</P>

Section 1921 of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as “section 1921”), as amended, (42 U.S.C. 1396r-2) expanded the requirements under the NPDB and requires each state to adopt a system of reporting to the Secretary adverse licensure or certification actions taken against health care practitioners, health care entities, providers, and suppliers, as well as certain final adverse actions taken by state law and fraud enforcement agencies against health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers. Section 1128E of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as “section 1128E”), as amended, (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7e) authorizes the Secretary to implement a national healthcare fraud and abuse data collection program for the reporting and disclosing of certain final adverse actions taken by Federal Government agencies and health plans against health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers. Information from section 1921 and section 1128E is to be reported and distributed through the NPDB. The regulations in this part set forth the reporting and disclosure requirements for the NPDB, as well as procedures to dispute <PRTPAGE P="166"/>the accuracy of information contained in the NPDB.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Hospital</E> means, for purposes of this part, an entity described in paragraphs <PRTPAGE P="168"/>(1) and (7) of section 1861(e) of the Social Security Act.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Medical malpractice action or claim</E> means a written complaint or claim demanding payment based on a health care practitioner's provision of or failure to provide health care services, and includes the filing of a cause of action based on the law of tort, brought in any state or Federal court or other adjudicative body.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Negative action or finding</E> by a Federal or State licensing or certification authority, peer review organization, or private accreditation entity means:</P>
              <P>(1) A final determination of denial or termination of an accreditation status from a private accreditation entity that indicates a risk to the safety of a patient(s) or quality of health care services;</P>
              <P>(2) Any recommendation by a peer review organization to sanction a health care practitioner; or</P>
              <P>(3) Any negative action or finding that, under the state's law, is publicly available information and is rendered by a licensing or certification authority, including but not limited to, limitations on the scope of practice, liquidations, injunctions, and forfeitures. This definition also includes final adverse actions rendered by a Federal or state licensing or certification authority, such as exclusions, revocations, or suspension of license or certification, that occur in conjunction with settlements in which no finding of liability has been made (although such a settlement itself is not reportable under the statute). This definition excludes administrative fines or citations and corrective action plans and other personnel actions, unless they are:</P>
              <P>(i) Connected to the delivery of health care services; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Taken in conjunction with other adverse licensure or certification actions such as revocation, suspension, censure, reprimand, probation, or surrender.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Organization name</E> means the subject's business or employer at the time the underlying acts occurred. If more than one business or employer is applicable, the one most closely related to the underlying acts should be reported as the “organization name,” with the others being reported as “affiliated or associated health care entities.”</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Organization type</E> means a description of the nature of that business or employer.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Other adjudicated actions or decisions</E> means formal or official final actions taken against a health care practitioner, provider, or supplier by a Federal governmental agency, a state law or fraud enforcement agency, or a health plan, which include the availability of a due process mechanism, and are based on acts or omissions that affect or could affect the payment, provision, or delivery of a health care item or service. For example, a formal or official final action taken by a Federal governmental agency, a state law or fraud enforcement agency, or a health plan may include, but is not limited to, a personnel-related action such as suspensions without pay, reductions in pay, reductions in grade for cause, terminations, or other comparable actions. A hallmark of any valid adjudicated action or decision is the availability of a due process mechanism. The fact that the subject elects not to use the due process mechanism provided by the authority bringing the action is immaterial, as long as such a process is available to the subject before the adjudicated action or decision is made final. In general, if an “adjudicated action or decision” follows an agency's established administrative procedures (which ensure that due process is available to the subject of the final adverse action), it would qualify as a reportable action under this definition. This definition specifically excludes clinical privileging actions taken by Federal Government agencies or state law and fraud enforcement agencies and similar paneling decisions made by health plans. This definition does not include overpayment determinations made by Federal or state government programs, their contractors or health plans, and it does not include denial of claims determinations made by Federal Government agencies, state law or fraud enforcement agencies, or health plans. This definition also does not include business or administrative decisions taken by health plans that result in contract terminations unrelated to health care fraud <PRTPAGE P="169"/>or abuse or quality of care (e.g., when a practitioner's contract is terminated because the practitioner no longer practices at a facility in the health plan's network, or a health plan terminates all provider contracts in a certain geographic area because it ceases business operations in that area). For health plans that are not government entities, an action taken following adequate notice and the opportunity for a hearing that meets the standards of due process set out in section 412(b) of the HCQIA (42 U.S.C. 11112(b)) also would qualify as a reportable action under this definition.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Peer review organization</E> means, for purposes of this part, an organization with the primary purpose of evaluating the quality of patient care practices or services ordered or performed by health care practitioners measured against objective criteria which define acceptable and adequate practice through an evaluation by a sufficient number of health care practitioners in such an area to ensure adequate peer review. The organization has due process mechanisms available to health care practitioners. This definition excludes utilization and quality control peer review organizations described in Part B of Title XI of the Social Security Act (referred to as QIOs) and other organizations funded by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to support the QIO program.</P>

              <P>(3) Which adversely affects or may adversely affect the clinical privileges or membership in a professional society of the health care practitioner.</P>

              <P>(ii) The health care practitioner's fees or the health care practitioner's advertising or engaging in other competitive acts intended to solicit or retain business;</P>
              <P>(iii) The health care practitioner's participation in prepaid group health plans, salaried employment, or any other manner of delivering health services whether on a fee-for-service or other basis;</P>

The actual fees will be announced by the Secretary in periodic notices in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> However, for purposes of verification and dispute resolution at the time the report is accepted, the NPDB will provide a copy—at the time a report has been submitted, automatically, without a request and free of charge, of the record to the health care practitioner, entity, provider, or supplier who is the subject of the report and to the reporter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria for determining the fee.</E> The amount of each fee will be determined based on the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) Direct and indirect personnel costs, including salaries and fringe benefits such as medical insurance and retirement,</P>
              <P>(2) Physical overhead, consulting, and other indirect costs (including materials and supplies, utilities, insurance, travel, and rent and depreciation on land, buildings, and equipment),</P>
              <P>(3) Agency management and supervisory costs,</P>

              <P>(4) Costs of enforcement, research, and establishment of regulations and guidance,<PRTPAGE P="184"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) Use of electronic data processing equipment to collect and maintain information—the actual cost of the service, including computer search time, runs and printouts, and</P>
              <P>(6) Any other direct or indirect costs related to the provision of services.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Assessing and collecting fees.</E> The Secretary will announce through notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> from time to time the methods of payment of NPDB fees. In determining these methods, the Secretary will consider efficiency, effectiveness, and convenience for the NPDB users and the Department. Methods may include: credit card, electronic fund transfer, and other methods of electronic payment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Confidentiality of National Practitioner Data Bank information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Limitations on disclosure.</E> Information reported to the NPDB is considered confidential and shall not be disclosed outside the Department of Health and Human Services, except as specified in §§ 60.17, 60.18, and 60.21 of this part. Persons and entities receiving information from the NPDB, either directly or from another party, must use it solely with respect to the purpose for which it was provided. The Data Bank report may not be disclosed, but nothing in this section will prevent the disclosure of information by a party from its own files used to create such reports where disclosure is otherwise authorized under applicable state or Federal law.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Penalty for violations.</E> Any person who violates paragraph (a) of this section shall be subject to a civil money penalty of up to $11,000 for each violation. This penalty will be imposed pursuant to procedures at 42 CFR part 1003.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How to dispute the accuracy of National Practitioner Data Bank information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Who may dispute the NPDB information.</E> The NPDB will routinely mail or transmit electronically to the subject a copy of the report filed in the NPDB. In addition, as indicated in § 60.18, the subject may also request a copy of such report. The subject of the report or a designated representative may dispute the accuracy of a report concerning himself, herself, or itself as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures for disputing a report with the reporting entity.</E> (1) If the subject disagrees with the reported information, the subject must request in the format as determined by the Secretary that the NPDB enter the report into “disputed status.”</P>
              <P>(2) The NPDB will send the report, with a notation that the report has been placed in “disputed status,” to queriers (where identifiable), the reporting entity and the subject of the report.</P>
              <P>(3) The subject must attempt to enter into discussion with the reporting entity to resolve the dispute. If the reporting entity revises the information originally submitted to the NPDB, the NPDB will notify the subject and all entities to whom reports have been sent that the original information has been revised. If the reporting entity does not revise the reported information, or does not respond to the subject within 60 days, the subject may request that the Secretary review the report for accuracy. The Secretary will decide whether to correct the report within 30 days of the request. This time frame may be extended for good cause. The subject also may provide a statement to the NPDB, either directly or through a designated representative that will permanently append the report.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures for requesting a review of a disputed report.</E> (1) The subject must request, in the format as determined by the Secretary, that the Secretary review the report for accuracy. The subject must return this request to the NPDB along with appropriate materials that support the subject's position. The Secretary will only review the accuracy of the reported information, and will not consider the merits or appropriateness of the action or the due process that the subject received.</P>
              <P>(2) After the review, if the Secretary:</P>

              <P>(i) Concludes that the information is accurate and reportable to the NPDB, the Secretary will inform the subject and the NPDB of the determination. The Secretary will include a brief statement (Secretarial Statement) in <PRTPAGE P="185"/>the report that describes the basis for the decision. The report will be removed from “disputed status.” The NPDB will distribute the corrected report and statement(s) to previous queriers (where identifiable), the reporting entity and the subject of the report.</P>
              <P>(ii) Concludes that the information contained in the report is inaccurate, the Secretary will inform the subject of the determination and direct the NPDB or the reporting entity to revise the report. The Secretary will include a brief statement (Secretarial Statement) in the report describing the findings. The NPDB will distribute the corrected report and statement(s) to previous queriers (where identifiable), the reporting entity and the subject of the report.</P>
              <P>(iii) Determines that the disputed issues are outside the scope of the Department's review, the Secretary will inform the subject and the NPDB of the determination. The Secretary will include a brief statement (Secretarial Statement) in the report describing the findings. The report will be removed from “disputed status.” The NPDB will distribute the report and the statement(s) to previous queriers (where identifiable), the reporting entity and the subject of the report.</P>
              <P>(iv) Determines that the adverse action was not reportable and therefore should be removed from the NPDB, the Secretary will inform the subject and direct the NPDB to void the report. The NPDB will distribute a notice to previous queriers (where identifiable), the reporting entity and the subject of the report that the report has been voided.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>To assure that the business of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is conducted effectively, objectively, and without improper influence or the appearance of improper influence, employees and special Government employees must be persons of integrity and must observe high standards of honesty, impartiality, and behavior. They must not engage in any conduct prejudicial to the Government and must avoid conflicts of private interests with public duties and responsibilities. In accord with these principles, the regulations in this part are issued to inform HHS employees and special Government employees what standards of conduct are expected of them in performing their duties and what activities are permitted or prohibited both while they are employed and after their employment with the Department is ended.</P>

The term also includes HHS employees who are detailed to non-Federal or other Federal organizations. At times the term “regular employee” is used in place of “employee” to make a clear distinction between special Government employees and others employed by the Federal government.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Special Government employee</E> means an individual who is retained, designated, appointed, or employed to perform temporary duties either on a full-time or intermittent basis, with or without compensation, for not to exceed 130 days during any period of 365 consecutive days.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Person</E> means an individual, a corporation, a company, an association, a <PRTPAGE P="195"/>firm, a partnership or any other organization.</P>

              <P>(b) Supervisors, because of their day-to-day relationships with employees, are responsible to a large degree for making sure high standards of conduct are maintained. They must become familiar with the Department's standards of conduct regulations and apply the standards to the work they do and supervise.

              <P>Sexual harassment is deliberate unsolicited verbal comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature which are unwelcome. Sexual harassment is unacceptable conduct and is expressly prohibited. In addition, supervisors and managers are prohibited from taking or promising personnel actions in exchange for sexual favors, or failing to take an action because an employee or applicant for employment, refuses to engage in sexual conduct. This same prohibition applies to relationships between Department personnel who take or recommend action on a grant or contract and the grantee or contractor. Those employees who wish to file a complaint of sexual harassment should contact the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) within their respective agencies for guidance. (Time frames for pursuing a charge alleging sexual harassment are the same as for any other complaint based on allegations of sex discrimination.)</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use of official information.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The public interest requires that certain information in the possession of the Government be kept confidential, and released only with general or specific authority under Department or operating component regulations. Such information may involve the national security or be private, personal, or business information which has been furnished to the Government in confidence. In addition, information in the possession of the Government and not <PRTPAGE P="199"/>generally available may not be used for private gain. The following paragraphs set forth the rules to be followed by Department employees in handling information in official files or documents:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Classified information.</E> Employees who have access to information which is classified for security reasons in accordance with Executive Order 12065 are responsible for its custody and safekeeping, and for assuring that it is not disclosed to unauthorized persons. See the Department's Security Manual, Part 3 for details.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Security and investigative information.</E> Security and investigative data received from Government agencies or other sources for official use only within the Department or developed under a pledge of confidence is not to be divulged to unauthorized persons or agencies.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Information obtained in confidence.</E> Certain Department units (e.g., Food and Drug Administration, and the Social Security Administration) obtain in the course of their program activities certain information from businesses or individuals which they are forbidden by law from disclosing. These statutory prohibitions are found in 21 U.S.C. 331j, and 18 U.S.C. 1905. Each employee is responsible for observing these laws.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Use of information for private gain.</E> Government employees are sometimes able to obtain information about some action the Government is about to take or some other matter which is not generally known. Information of this kind shall not be used by the employee to further his or her or someone else's private financial or other interests. Such a use of official information is clearly a violation of a public trust. Employees shall not, directly or indirectly, make use of, or permit others to make use of, for the purpose of furthering any private interest, official information not made available to the general public.</P>
              <P>(b) The Privacy Act provides criminal penalties for an employee who willfully discloses individually identifiable information from records, disclosure of which is prohibited by that Act. 5 U.S.C. 552a(i).</P>

              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Department considers the indebtedness of its employees to be a matter of their own concern. However, employees shall not by failure to meet their just financial obligations reflect adversely on the Government as their employer. Employees are expected to pay each just financial obligation in a proper and timely manner. A “just financial obligation” is one acknowledged by the employee or reduced to judgment by a court, or one imposed by law such as Federal, State, or local taxes. “In a proper and timely manner” is a manner which the Department determines does not, under the circumstances, reflect adversely on the part of an employee in meeting his or her financial obligations, particularly those that relate to support of the employee's family, to payment of Federal, State, or local taxes, or to payments to tax-supported institutions such as a city or State hospital, or educational institution. If for some reason an employee is unable to pay these obligations promptly, he or she is expected to make satisfactory arrangements for payment and abide by these arrangements.</P>
              <P>(b) Disciplinary action may be considered when an employee has handled his or her financial affairs in such a way that:</P>
              <P>(1) Action on complaints received from creditors requires the use of a considerable amount of official time, or</P>
              <P>(2) It appears that financial difficulties are impairing the employee's efficiency on the job, or</P>
              <P>(3) Because of the employee's financial irresponsibility, the attitude of the general public toward the Department may be adversely affected; and the employee after counseling does not make arrangements to meet his or her financial obligations.</P>

              <P>(1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relations with the employee's principal operating component, or sub-unit thereof; or with a component of the Department with respect to which the employee has official duties;</P>

              <P>(a) An employee may accept a gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan or similar favor of monetary value which stems from a family relationship such as that between the employee and his or her parents, spouse or children, if it is clear that the relationship is the motivating factor.</P>
              <P>(b) Loans from banks or other financial institutions may be accepted on customary terms.</P>
              <P>(c) Unsolicited advertising or promotional material such as pens, note pads, calendars and similar items of nominal intrinsic value may be accepted.</P>

              <P>(d) An employee may accept food or refreshment of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner meeting or on an inspection tour only if the employee is properly in attendance and there is not a reasonable opportunity to pay.

However, if there is any indication that the award may improperly influence the employee in the performance of his or her offical duties, advice about the acceptance of it should be sought from a deputy ethics counselor. Also, an employee may not accept an award from an organization which the employee knows, or should know, has a contractual or other business arrangement with, or is regulated by, the principal operating component, or a sub-unit, in which he or she is employed or with respect to which the employee has official duties, unless acceptance is approved by the head of the employee's principal operating component.

              <P>(c) Intermittent employees are subject to the restrictions when in active duty status only and for the entire 24 hours of any day of actual employment.</P>
              <P>(d) Employees on leave, on leave without pay, or on furlough even though an employee's resignation has been accepted, are subject to the restrictions. Separated employees who have received a lump-sum payment for annual leave are not subject to the restriction during the period covered by the lump-sum payment or thereafter, provided they do not return to Federal employment during that period. Employees are not permitted to take a leave of absence to work with a political candidate, committee, or organization or to become a candidate for office with the understanding that they will resign their position if nominated or elected.</P>
              <P>(e) Employees are accountable for political activity by another person acting as their agent or under the employee's direction or control, if they are thus accomplishing indirectly what they may not lawfully do directly and openly.</P>
              <P>(f) Though officers in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps are not subject to the restrictions in Subchapter III of Chapter 73 of Title 5, United States Code, the provisions of this subpart apply to them.</P>

              <P>(a) Section 7324 of Title 5, United States Code, provides that employees have the right to vote as they please and to express their opinions on political subjects and candidates. Generally, however, employees are prohibited from taking an active part in political management or political campaigns or using official authority or influence to interfere with an election or affect its results. There are some exemptions from the restrictions of the statute:</P>
              <P>(1) Employees may engage in political activity in connection with any question not specifically identified with a national or State political party. They also may engage in political activity in connection with an election, if none of the candidates represents a party any of whose candidates for presidential elector received votes at the last preceding election at which presidential electors were selected.</P>
              <P>(2) An exception relates to political campaigns within, or in communities adjacent to, the District of Columbia, or in communities the majority of whose voters are employees of the Federal government. Communities to which the exception applies are specifically designated by the Office of Personnel Management. Information regarding the localities and the conditions under which the exceptions are granted may be obtained from personnel offices or the Department Counselor or deputy counselors.</P>
              <P>(b) A covered employee is permitted to:</P>
              <P>(1) Register and vote in any election;</P>

              <P>(3) Display a political picture, sticker, badge or button;</P>
              <P>(4) Participate in the nonpartisan activities of a civic, community, social, labor, or professional organization, or of a similar organization;</P>

              <P>(9) Take an active part, as an independent candidate, or support of an independent candidate, in a partisan election in localities identified as permissible for such activities by the Office of Personnel Management;</P>
              <P>(10) Take an active part, as a candidate or in support of a candidate, in a nonpartisan election;</P>

              <P>(11) Be politically active in connection with a question which is not specifically identified with a political <PRTPAGE P="204"/>party, such as a constitutional amendment, referendum, approval of a municipal ordinance or any other question or issue of a similar character;</P>
              <P>(12) Serve as an election judge or clerk, or in a similar position to perform nonpartisan duties as prescribed by State or local law; and</P>
              <P>(13) Otherwise participate fully in public affairs, except as prohibited by law, in a manner which does not materially compromise his or her efficiency or integrity as an employee or the neutrality, efficiency, or integrity of his or her agency.</P>
              <P>(c) The head of a principal operating component may prohibit or limit the participation of an employee or class of employees of his or her component in an activity permitted by paragraph (b) of this section, if participation in the activity would interfere with the efficient performance of official duties, or create a conflict or apparent conflict of interest.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Outside employment may be appropriate when it will not adversely affect performance of an employee's official duties and will not reflect discredit on the Government or the Department. Such work may include civic, charitable, religious, and community undertakings. There are certain types of outside work, however, which give rise to a real or apparent conflict of interest. Some of these are prohibited by law. Others are prohibited by regulation, as discussed in paragraph (b) of this section, or by criteria developed by heads of operating components for application within a particular component. All of these provisions are binding, but they do not necessarily include all possible conflicts of interest. In all instances, good judgment must be used to avoid a conflict between an employee's Federal responsibilities and outside activities.</P>
              <P>(b) An employee shall not engage in outside employment or other outside activity not compatible with the full and proper discharge of the duties and responsibilities of his or her Government employment whether or not in violation of any specific provision of law. Incompatible activities include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, or any other thing of monetary value in any circumstances in which acceptance may result in, or create the appearance of, conflicts of interest;</P>
              <P>(2) Outside employment which tends to impair the employee's mental or physical capacity to perform Government duties and responsibilities in an acceptable manner;</P>
              <P>(3) Work which identifies the Department or any employee in his or her official capacity with any organization commercializing products relating to work conducted by the Department, or with any commercial advertising matter, or work performed under such circumstances as to give the impression that it is an official act of the Department or represents an official point of view;</P>
              <P>(4) Outside work or activity that takes the employee's time and attention during his official work hours.</P>

              <P>(c) An employee shall not receive any salary or anything of monetary value from a private source as compensation for services to the Government. For example, a Department employee may be called upon, as a part of his or her official duties, to participate in a professional meeting sponsored by a non-Government organization, or to contribute a paper or other writing prepared on official time for publication under non-Government auspices. The employee must not accept an honorarium or fee for such services, even though the organization accepting the service customarily makes such a payment to those who participate. Nor may the employee accept a contribution to some charity, educational institution, or the like, in appreciation of the services furnished by the Department employee who cannot accept the usual payment. All offers to make such a contribution must be refused. Any employee with whom such a question is <PRTPAGE P="206"/>raised shall explain that the service involved was provided as an official action of the Department and is authorized by law. Under these circumstances, it is inappropriate for any payment to be made, even indirectly and to a third party, for services which are furnished without charge by the Government.</P>
              <P>(d) Other than as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, employees may receive compensation or other things of monetary value for any lecture, discussion, writing or appearance the subject matter of which is in part devoted to the responsibility, programs or operations of the Department so long as the activity is undertaken in a personal capacity, is not performed as official duty, is not done while on official time, and does not create a conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest. However, such activities are considered outside employment and may be undertaken only as provided in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(e) This section does not restrict the acceptance of compensation or other things of monetary value for any lecture, discussion, writing or appearance, the subject matter of which is not devoted to the responsibilities, programs, or operations of the Department and which are undertaken in a private capacity and in accordance with § 73.735-704, § 73.735-705, or § 73.735-706.</P>
              <P>(f) Federal law limits the amount of honorarium that may be paid any employee for any one speech, writing or appearance to $2,000.00 (not to include amounts for actual travel and subsistence expenses for the employee and his or her spouse) and an aggregate of $25,000.00 in any calendar year. This limitation applies to such activities whether or not the subject matter is related to the responsibilities, programs or operations of the Department. (2 U.S.C. 441i) The term “honorarium” means payment of money or other thing of value whether made gratuitously or as a fee for an appearance, speech or article but does not include salary or compensation made for services rendered on a continuing basis, such as for teaching, or as proceeds from the sale of a book or similar undertaking.</P>
              <P>(g) An employee who is a Presidential appointee covered by section 401(a) of Executive Order 11222 shall not receive compensation or anything of monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing or appearance, the subject matter of which is devoted substantially to the responsibilities, programs, or operations of his or her component, or which draws substantially on official data or ideas which have not or will not on request become public information.</P>
              <P>(h) Application of these general provisions to some specific activities is discussed below.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 73.735-702</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Criminal prohibitions on outside activities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An employee may not, with or without compensation, represent another before any Government agency, court or commission in connection with any proceeding, application, request for a ruling, contract, claim or other particular matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest. (18 U.S.C. 203 and 205)</P>
              <P>(b) An employee may not act as agent or attorney for anyone else in prosecuting any claim against the United States (18 U.S.C. 205).</P>
              <P>(c) As an exception to the above, if it is not inconsistent with the performance of his or her duties, an employee may act without compensation as an agent or attorney for another employee, or a person under active consideration for Federal employment, who is the subject of disciplinary, loyalty, or other personnel administration proceedings in connection with those proceedings at the administrative level. For example, an employee may represent another employee who is the subject of disciplinary action, or the complainant in a discrimination proceeding, at all stages within the Department and before the Merit Systems Protection Board or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission but not in Federal Court. It would be inconsistent with the performance of official duties for a supervisor to represent subordinate employees.</P>

              <P>(d) The law and these regulations do not prohibit an employee from acting, with or without compensation, as <PRTPAGE P="207"/>agent or attorney for his or her parents, spouse, child or any person for whom, or estate for which, he or she is acting as fiduciary provided that the head of the principal operating component or his or her designee approve. Such approval, if granted, must be granted in accordance with the procedures for approval of outside activity. However, the employee may not do so if the particular matter is one in which he or she has participated personally and substantially or which is his or her official responsibility.

              <SUBJECT>Professional and consultative services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Employees may engage in outside professional or consultative work only after meeting certain conditions. Except as provided in §§ 73.735-705 and 73.735-706 for activities discussed in those sections, the conditions which must be met are:</P>
              <P>(1) The work is not to be rendered, with or without compensation, to organizations, institutions, or state or local governments with which the official duties of the employee are directly related, or indirectly related if the indirect relationship is significant enough to cause the existence of conflict or apparent conflict of interest; or</P>
              <P>(2) The work is not to be rendered for compensation to help a person, institution, or government unit prepare or aid in the preparation of grant applications, contract proposals, program reports, and other material which are designed to become the subject of dealings between the institutions or government units and the Federal Government. All requests to perform consultative services, either compensated or uncompensated, for institutions or government units which have recently negotiated or may in the near future seek a contract or grant from this Department must be carefully appraised to avoid any conflict or apparent conflict of interest.</P>
              <P>(b) Advance administrative approval in accordance with § 73.735-708 of this subpart must be obtained. Such approval is required whether or not the services are for compensation, and whether or not related to the employee's official duties.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purpose of this section, “professional and consultative work” is performance of work requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a course of specialized instruction and study in an institution of higher education, or hospital which requires the exercise of judgment and discretion in its performance and is primarily intellectual in nature as opposed to manual, mechanical or physical work.</P>
              <P>(d) Membership on a Board of Directors, Board of Regents, Board of Trustees, Planning Commission, Advisory Council or Committee, or on any similar body which provides advice, counsel, or consultation, shall be considered outside consultative services for which advance administrative approval is required.</P>

When clearance is denied at any lower level, the employee shall have recourse for review up to the head of the principal operating component.

              <P>(a) Employees may be members of professional societies and be elected or appointed to office in such a society. Activity in professional associations is generally desirable from the point of view of both the Department and the employee. Employees shall avoid, however, any real or apparent conflict of interest in connection with such membership. For example, they must not:</P>
              <P>(1) Directly or indirectly commit the Department or any portion of it on any matter unless such action is taken in an official capacity;</P>
              <P>(2) Permit their names to be attached to documents the distribution of which would be likely to embarrass the Department; or</P>
              <P>(3) Serve in capacities involving them as representatives of non-Government organizations in dealing with the Government.</P>
              <P>(b) In undertaking any office or function beyond ordinary membership in a professional association, a Department employee must obtain advance approval in accordance with § 73.735-708 of this subpart in any situation in which his or her responsibilities as an officer would relate to his or her official duties or would create a real or apparent conflict of interest with responsibilities as a Department employee. For example, advance administrative approval must be obtained:</P>
              <P>(1) Before an employee who is responsible for review and approval of grants or contracts, or is in a supervisory position over those who conduct review and approval, may hold office, or be a trustee or member of the governing board, or the chairman or member of a committee, in any organization which has or is seeking a grant or contract with the bureau or comparable organizational unit in which he or she is employed;</P>
              <P>(2) Before an employee may hold office in an organization which customarily expresses publicly views on matters of legislative or administrative policy within the specific areas of concern to the Department.</P>

(See § 73.735-704(a)(2))</P>
              <P>(c) The Department Ethics Counselor will review and approve outside work requests for Executive level officers, non-career executives, deputy ethics counselors, and Schedule C employees in the Office of the Secretary.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Participation in matters affecting a personal financial interest.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An employee shall not participate personally and substantially as a Government employee in a matter in which any of the following individuals or organizations has a financial interest:</P>
              <P>(1) The employee;</P>
              <P>(2) The employee's spouse;</P>
              <P>(3) The employee's minor child;</P>
              <P>(4) An organization in which the employee serves as an officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee; or</P>
              <P>(5) A person or organization with which the employee is negotiating for prospective employment or has an arrangement for prospective employment. Criminal penalties may be imposed under 18 U.S.C. 208 for violations of the prohibition.</P>
              <P>(b) Applying the provision of 18 U.S.C. 208:</P>

              <P>(1) A “financial interest” is any interest of monetary value which may be directly and predictably affected by the official action of an employee. There is no minimum amount of value or control that constitutes a financial interest.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
                <P>An employee owns a single share of stock in a widely-held corporation. If the corporation is likely to be affected by a matter in which the employee participates as a Government official, the employee may violate 18 U.S.C. 208.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2:</HD>
                <P>An employee has a paid part-time position with a non-federal organization. If the organization is likely to be affected by a matter in which the employee participates as a Government official, the employee would violate 18 U.S.C. 208.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              

              <P>(2) The prohibition of 18 U.S.C. 208 applies to personal and substantial involvement by an employee in a matter, exercised through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, investigation, giving advice, or other significant effort regarding the matter.
              </P>

                <P>An employee is a member of a panel that evaluates proposals for contracts and makes recommendations as to their award. If the employee's spouse owns stock in a company which submits a proposal that is reviewed by the panel, the employee would violate 18 U.S.C. 208 even though the panel recommendation may be rejected by the contracting officer.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2:</HD>
                <P>An employee is on a leave of absence from a university. He or she would violate 18 U.S.C. 208 by participating in the drafting of regulations which would have a “direct and predictable effect” upon universities in general and, therefore, upon the employee's university.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              

              <P>(3) An employee must know that the financial interest exists in order to violate 18 U.S.C. 208.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>An employee inherited a beneficial interest in a trust. He or she does not, however, have actual knowledge of the specific property held by the trustee. If the trust contains stock in a corporation which may be affected by the employee's official actions, he or she would not violate 18 U.S.C. 208 in taking official action affecting the corporation.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              

              <P>(4) Negotiation for prospective employment includes both an indication of interest on the part of the employee in working for an organization and an affirmative action on the part of the organization to show consideration of the employee.

              <SUBJECT>Resolution of apparent or actual conflicts of interest.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Disqualification from participating in a particular matter or category of matters is an appropriate method for resolving apparent or actual conflicts of interest when the interest or activity giving rise to the problem:</P>
              <P>(1) Bears a direct or indirect relationship to particular, identifiable duties of the employee involved; and</P>

              <P>(2) Is not so substantial as to affect or give the appearance of affecting the integrity of the services which the Government may expect of the employee. Whenever disqualification is employed to resolve an apparent or actual conflict of interest, the disqualified employee shall sign a written statement reflecting the scope of the disqualification and the precise nature of the conflicting interest or activity. The reviewing official shall keep a file of all such disqualification statements <PRTPAGE P="217"/>and shall monitor compliance with these statements on a regular basis.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Change of assignment</E> is an appropriate method for resolving apparent or actual conflicts of interest when the interest giving rise to the problem bears a direct or indirect relationship to particular, identifiable duties of the employee involved, and those duties constitute a significant portion of the employee's position.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Waiver</E> under 18 U.S.C. 208(b) is an appropriate method for resolving apparent or actual conflicts of interest when:</P>
              <P>(1) The employee seeking the waiver reported the financial interest that bears some relationship to his or her official duties, and the reviewing official, in consultation with a deputy ethics counselor or the Department Ethics Counselor, determines that the financial interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such employee; or</P>
              <P>(2) By general rule or regulation published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> the Department has exempted the financial interest from the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 208 and this part as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of the Government officers' service.</P>
              <P>(d) A <E T="03">trust</E> containing a financial interest which may give rise to an apparent or actual conflict of interest is an appropriate method of resolving such conflicts when:</P>
              <P>(1) The trust is qualified under section 202(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-521), as amended, and subject to the regulations of the Office of Government Ethics; or</P>
              <P>(2) In the opinion of the Department's Ethics Counselor, it is sufficiently independent of the employee involved so that the integrity of the employee's services to the Government are not compromised.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Divestiture</E> is an appropriate method for resolving actual conflicts of interest when the nature of the financial interest is such that the conflict of interest cannot be adequately resolved by any of the methods set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Terminating</E> an appointment as a method for resolving an actual conflict of interest should be used only when it is clear that no other remedy can be found which would be acceptable to both the Department and the employee.

              <SUBJECT>Coverage.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For purposes of this subpart the title “consultant” will be used to include those who are appointed to serve as experts, consultants or members of advisory committees. All persons who serve as an employee of the Government in the capacity of a consultant are covered by the provisions of this subpart irrespective of:</P>
              <P>(1) The title by which designated;</P>
              <P>(2) The statutory authority under which services are obtained;</P>
              <P>(3) The duration of the period for which services are obtained;</P>
              <P>(4) Whether services are obtained by appointment or invitation and acceptance;</P>
              <P>(5) Whether services are compensated or rendered without compensation;</P>
              <P>(6) Whether or not services are obtained pursuant to a statute excepting employees or special Government employees from conflict of interest statutes.</P>
              <P>(b) When the service is for less than 130 days in a service year, experts, consultants, and advisory committee members are included in the group of employees designated by law (18 U.S.C. 202) as “Special Government employees.”</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 73.735-1002</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Ethical standards of conduct.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Like other Federal employees, an individual serving in a consultant capacity must conduct himself or herself according to ethical behavior standards of the highest order. In particular, such an individual must:</P>

              <P>(1) Refrain from any use of office which is, or appears to be, motivated by a private gain for himself or herself <PRTPAGE P="218"/>or other persons, particularly those with whom he or she has family, business, or financial ties. The fact that desired gain, if it materializes, will not take place at the expense of the Government makes his or her actions no less improper.</P>
              <P>(2) Conduct himself or herself in a manner devoid of any suggestion that he or she is exploiting Government employment for private advantage. A consultant must not, on the basis of any inside information, enter into any speculation or recommend speculation to members of his or her family or business associates, in commodities, land, or the securities of any private company. This injunction applies even though the consultant's duties have no connection whatever with the Government programs or activities which may affect the value of such commodities, land, or securities. He or she should be careful in all personal financial activities to avoid any appearance of acting on the basis of information obtained in the course of his or her Government work.</P>
              <P>(3) Refrain from using information not generally available to those outside the Government for the special benefit of a business or other entity by which the consultant is employed or retained or in which he or she has a financial interest. Information not available to private industry should remain confidential in the consultant's hands and not be divulged to his or her private employer or clients. In cases of doubt whether information is generally available to the public, the consultant should confer with the person for whom he or she provides services, with the office having functional responsibility for a specific type of information, or, as appropriate, with the officials designated in § 73.735-202 to give interpretive and advisory service.</P>
              <P>(4) Where requested by a private enterprise to act for it in a consultant or advisory capacity and the request appears motivated by the desire for inside information, make a choice between acceptance of the tendered private employment and continuation of his or her Government consultancy. He or she may not engage in both.</P>
              <P>(5) Not use his or her position in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, anyone to provide a financial benefit to him or her or another person, particularly one with whom the consultant has family, business, or financial ties.</P>
              <P>(6) Not receive or solicit anything of value as a gift, gratuity, loan, entertainment, or favor for himself or herself or another person, particularly one with whom he or she has family, business, or financial ties if the acceptance would result in loss of complete independence or impartiality in serving the Government. All consultants are subject to the restrictions in § 73.735-506 of this part concerning gifts and decorations from foreign governments.</P>
              <P>(b) Consultants may engage in other employment so long as there is no real or apparent conflict between the consultant's private employment and his or her official duties. See § 73.735 Subpart G. The regular employment of a consultant who is a special Government employee is not considered outside work for purposes of Subpart G. Also, the limitation in § 73.735-701(f) regarding the amount of an honorarium that may be received does not apply to special Government employees.</P>
              <P>(c) A consultant who has questions about conflicts of interest or the application of the regulations in this part to him or her or to his or her assigned work should make inquiry of the person for whom services are provided. That person may direct the consultant to the Department Ethics Counselor or a deputy ethics counselor for interpretative and advisory services as provided in § 73.735-202.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 73.735-1003</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Conflicts of interest statutes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each consultant should acquaint himself or herself with sections 203, 205, 207 and 208 of title 18, United States Code, all of which carry criminal penalties related to conflicts of interest. The restraints imposed by the four criminal sections are summarized in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) 18 U.S.C. 203 and 205.</P>

              <P>(1) These two sections in general operate to preclude a person who works for the Government, except in the discharge of his or her official duties, from representing anyone else before a <PRTPAGE P="219"/>court or Government agency in a matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest. The prohibition applies whether or not compensation is received for the representation. However, if the individual is a special Government employee, this restriction applies only if:</P>
              <P>(i) The representation involves a matter in which the individual has at any time participated personally and substantially in the course of his or her Government employment; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The individual has served the Department for more than 60 days in the immediately preceding period of 365 days, and the matter is one which is pending before the Department. This second restraint applies whether or not the matter is one in which the individual participated personally and substantially in his or her Government employment. These two provisions apply to a special Government employee on days when he or she does not serve the Government as well as on the days when services are rendered, and they apply to both paid and unpaid representation.</P>
              <P>(2) To a considerable extent the prohibitions of sections 203 and 205 are aimed at the sale of influence to gain special favors for private businesses and other organizations and at the misuse of governmental position or information. In accordance with these aims, a consultant, even when not compelled to do so by sections 203 and 205, should make every effort in his or her private work to avoid any personal contact with respect to negotiations for contracts or grants with the component of the department in which he or she is serving, if the subject matter is related to the subject matter of his or her consultancy or other service. This will not always be possible to achieve where, for example, a consultant has an executive position with his or her regular employer which requires him or her to participate personally in contract negotiations with the department or agency he or she is advising. Whenever this is the case, the consultant should participate in the negotiations for his or her employer only after advising the responsible Government official of his or her involvement in other matters in the Department. In other instances an occasional consultant may have technical knowledge which is indispensable to his or her regular employer in his efforts to formulate a research and development contract or a research grant, and for the same reason, it is in the interest of the Government that the consultant should take part in negotiations for his or her private employer. Again, the individual should participate only after advising the responsible Government official of the relevant facts.</P>

              <P>(3) Section 205 permits both the Government and the private employer of a special Government employee to benefit, in certain cases, from his or her performance of work under a grant or contract for which he or she would otherwise be disqualified because of having participated in the matter for the Government or because it is pending in a component in which the consultant had served more than 60 days in the past year. This provision gives the head of a department the authority, notwithstanding any prohibition in either section 203 or 205, to allow a special Government employee to represent before such department or agency either his or her regular employer or another person or organization in the performance of work under a grant or contract. As a basis for this action, the Secretary must first make a certification in writing, published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> that it is required by the national interest.</P>
              <P>(4) Section 205 contains two other exemptive provisions, which apply to both special and regular Government employees. See § 73.735-702.</P>
              <P>(c) 18 U.S.C. 207 applies to individuals who have left Government service. See Subpart N of these regulations.</P>

              <P>(d) 18 U.S.C. 208 bears on the activities of Government personnel, including special Government employees, in the course of their official duties. In general, it prevents a Government employee from participating as such in a particular matter in which, to his or her knowledge, he or she, his or her spouse, minor child, partner, or a profit or non-profit enterprise with which he or she is connected has a financial interest. However, the section permits an employee's agency to grant him or her <PRTPAGE P="220"/>an ad hoc exemption if the interest is not so substantial as to affect the integrity of his or her services. Insignificant interests may also be waived by a general rule or regulation. The matters in which special Government employees are disqualified by section 208 are not limited to those involving a specific party or parties in which the United States is a party or has an interest, as in the case of sections 203, 205 and 207. Section 208 therefore extends to matters in addition to contracts, grants, judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings, and other matters of an adversary nature. Accordingly, a special Government employee, like all government employees, should in general be disqualified from participating as such in a matter of any type the outcome of which will have a direct and predictable effect upon the financial interests covered by the section.</P>
              <FP>However, the power of exemption may be exercised in this situation if the special Government employee renders advice of a general nature from which no preference or advantage over others might be gained by any particular person or organization. The power of exemption may also be exercised where the financial interests involved are minimal in value.</FP>

              <P>(a) The purpose of criminal prohibition in 18 U.S.C. 207 is to prevent the unfair use of inside knowledge or influence that results from Federal service. 18 U.S.C. 207 generally prohibits a former employee from acting as another person's representative to the Government in particular matters involving a specific party or parties in which the employee had been involved while in Federal service. This prohibition does not require a former employee to decline employment with any organization regardless of his or her dealings with that organization while employed by the Government. It applies solely to activities, not the mere existence of an employment arrangement.</P>
              <P>(b) The Office of Government Ethics, Office of Personnel Management, has issued Government-wide regulations covering post-employment conflict of interest (5 CFR part 737). Those regulations are incorporated herein by reference, and they are available for review in personnel offices throughout the Department.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Principles and purpose.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) To assure that the business of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducted effectively, objectively, and without improper influence or appearance thereof, all employees must <PRTPAGE P="227"/>be persons of integrity and observe the highest standards of conduct. Because of FDA's special regulatory responsibilities to the consumer and industry, its employees must be especially alert to avoid any real or appearance of conflict of their private interests with their public duties. Their actions must be unquestionable and free from suspicion of partiality, favoritism, or any hint of conflicting interests. This supplement recognizes FDA's public obligation to set reasonable and fair safeguards for the prevention of employee conflicts of interest. It is necessary to meet FDA's regulatory responsibilities and to otherwise assure full protection of the public confidence in the integrity of its employees.</P>
              <P>(b) Since FDA is a unique consumer protection and regulatory agency within the Department, the DHHS Standards of Conduct need further supplementation to reflect this role. Therefore, for purposes of implementing the DHHS Standards of Conduct regulations within the FDA, this supplement provides interpretive definitions and additional requirements. As further guidance to its employees and supervisory officials, FDA will issue internal procedural instructions in accordance with this supplement.</P>

The Associate Commissioner for Administration (or his designee) is available to assist such employees in obtaining corporate data necessary to make such a determination.</P>
              <P>(b) Other employees are similarly responsible for observing the financial interest retention requirements in §§ 73a.735-501(b) and 73a.735-502(a)(2).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Control activity employees formerly associated with organizations subject to FDA regulation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For a period of 1 year after FDA appointment, or appointment to the Food and Drug Division, Office of the General Counsel, a control activity employee who was employed in a regulated organization within 1 year before FDA employment shall not participate in any regulatory action before FDA that involves the former employer organization. Exceptions may be authorized only under paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) A control activity employee who was previously employed in a regulated organization shall not participate in any regulatory action before FDA in which the employee had participated personally and substantially in behalf of the former employer organization, e.g., drug investigations/applications, food additive petitions, matters dealing with compliance in areas of radiation-producing products or medical devices. Exceptions may be authorized only under paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) Employment in a regulated organization includes contractual relationships, e.g., attorneys who may have represented an FDA-regulated firm or industry or an association of such firms and individuals who may have served a firm, industry or association in a consultant capacity.</P>
              <P>(d) Within 30 days after assignment to a control activity position, an employee shall submit to his supervisor detailed information concerning former industry employers, and dates and substance of involvement in such regulatory matters as may be subject to the prohibition in paragraph (b) of this action.</P>

              <P>(e) The Commissioner may grant individual exceptions to paragraphs (a) <PRTPAGE P="228"/>and (b) of this section whenever he determines that strict application would not be in the best interests of the United States. A memorandum of any exception granted shall be filed for public inspection in the Public Records and Documents Center, Food and Drug Administration, Room 4-68, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857, within 10 days after the Commissioner's decision. The memorandum shall include the employee's name, title, grade, summary of official duties, prior pertinent industry involvement, a brief description of the specific regulatory action in which the employee has been permitted to participate, and a statement explaining why such strict application of the subpart would not be in the best interests of the United States.</P>

              <P>(2) Be employed in an organization whose business activities are subject to FDA regulation unless:</P>
              <P>(i) The regulated activities of the organization are an insignificant part of its total operations, i.e., the regulated products of the organization constitute no more than 10 percent of its annual gross sales, and</P>
              <P>(ii) The outside employment is in nonregulated activities of the organization.</P>
              <P>(c) All other employees will generally be granted approval to engage in outside employment which is compatible with the full performance of their FDA duties and responsibilities and which will not give rise to a real or apparent conflict of interest. Permissible employment includes but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Employment where the sale of FDA-regulated products is incidential to the purpose of the establishment, e.g., hotels, theaters, bowling alleys, and sports arenas.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(iv) The employee will demonstrate a high degree of discretion and judgment in his contacts with customers and representatives of regulated industry and competitor firms so as to avoid giving the impression that:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) His part-time actions, recommendations, opinions, or remarks are official points of view;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) He is using his FDA position for private gain by oral misrepresentations and false claims of the company's products;</P>

              <P>(a) No restrictions are placed on ownership of diversified mutual funds.</P>
              <P>(b) An FDA employee, other than a control activity employee (defined in § 73a.735-502), may have financial interests:</P>
              <P>(1) In an organization whose FDA-regulated activities are an insignificant part of its total operations, i.e., no more than 10 percent of the organization's annual gross sales are in products regulated by FDA; or</P>

However, this prohibition is not applicable to:</P>
              <P>(1) Diversified mutual funds, which are exempted from 18 U.S.C. 208 by § 73.735-501(a) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) Financial interests for which the Commissioner has in advance granted a written exception on the ground that the public interest would be served if a particular employee is allowed to participate in an official matter whose outcome may have a direct and predictable effect on the employee's financial interest. Such exemptions will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. Any determination to authorize such exceptions shall be made in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) and documented for public inspection in accordance with § 73a.735-504.</P>

              <P>(a) An employee in regulatory activities (“control activity” employee) may hold financial interests in an FDA-regulated organization only if either of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The regulated activities of the organization are an “insignificant” part of its total business operations, or</P>
              <P>(2) Written approval for an individual exception is granted by the Commissioner in accordance with § 73a.735-504; however, such approval will not be considered unless all of the following conditions are met:</P>

              <P>(ii) Acquisition of the financial interest occurred by marriage or inheritance, or the interest was held prior to an FDA reorganization, change in regulations, or similar circumstances beyond the control of the employee that resulted in the interest becoming prohibited;<PRTPAGE P="230"/>

              <P>(1) A “control activity” employee (“control activity” positions are identified in appendix C to part 73 of this chapter), means one who:</P>

              <P>(ii) Occupies an FDA position below GS-11 with duties of a nature that the employee could in the discharge of his official duties and responsibilities cause an economic advantage for or impose a handicap on a non-Federal enterprise (includes investigators, inspectors, regulatory analysts);</P>
              <P>(iii) Occupies a position at GS-11 or above in the Office of the Assistant General Counsel, Food and Drug Division.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exceptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A control activity employee who can satisfy all of the conditions specified in § 73a.735-502(a)(2) may submit a request to retain a prohibited financial interest. Any such request must be submitted no later than 30 days after the event that results in the employee holding the prohibited financial interest. Such requests for exception should be forwarded in writing through supervisory channels to the Associate Commissioner for Administration for review by the FDA Conflict of Interest Review Board and subsequent recommendation to the Commissioner. All decisions on requests for exceptions shall be in writing and a copy furnished to the employee involved.</P>
              <P>(b) A memorandum of each approved exception shall be filed in the Public Records and Documents Center for public inspection. Such public disclosure shall be made within 10 days after the Commissioner's decision. The following is an example of the format of such memorandum (in a hypothetical employee situation):</P>
              <P>(1) Employee: Joe Doe.</P>
              <P>(2) Title: Research Chemist.</P>
              <P>(3) Grade/Salary: GS-14.</P>
              <P>(4) Organization: Bureau of Biologics, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Md.</P>
              <P>(5) Date of employee's request for exception: ___.</P>
              <P>(6) Date of Commissioner's approval: ___.</P>
              <P>(7) Basis for exception: Employee owns financial interest in the ABC Foods Corporation, and permanent retention is normally prohibited under FDA/HHS conflict of interest regulations for such an employee. The employee, however, acquired this financial interest prior to his reassignment to FDA on ___, which was part of a major Department reorganization transferring certain functions from NIH to the FDA (i.e., FDA's Bureau of Biologics). At the time of acquisition and immediately prior to the reorganization, the employee's financial interest was allowable under Department regulations. The employee's official duties are fully confined to the matters under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Biologics, and his official duties do not involve any contact with the food industry. The Commissioner has determined that an exception is warranted under the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) Acquisition occurred prior to Department reorganization;</P>
              <P>(ii) Financial interest retention will not give rise to an actual conflict of interest situation;</P>
              <P>(iii) There is no direct relationship between the employee's official duties and the regulated activities of ABC Foods;</P>

              <P>(iv) The employee occupies a position below that of Bureau or Deputy Bureau <PRTPAGE P="231"/>Director (or equivalent position in the Office of the Commissioner); and</P>
              <P>(v) The employee agrees to refrain from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions that are designed to increase the value/shares of the “excepted” ABC Foods interests.</P>
              <FP>This exception is considered equitable to the employee involved, and retention of the ABC Foods interest will not in any way impair the interests of the Government or of the public.</FP>
              <P>(c) In interpreting the requirement of § 73a.735-502(a)(2)(v), events not involving employee discretion (e.g., accepting dividends in the form of cash or additional shares) do not constitute transactions designed to increase the value/shares of an “excepted” financial interest. A transaction involving discretion, e.g., exercise of stock options, may be made only if proposed to the Associate Commissioner for Administration and approved by the Conflict of Interest Review Board as an amendment to the original exception. A memorandum recording such approval shall be made public in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) An employee may temporarily retain a prohibited financial interest pending review of a written request for an exception submitted in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Except as provided in § 73a.735-501(c), no employee may participate in an official matter whose outcome will have a direct and predictable effect on a financial interest held by him. This prohibition applies to official matters handled before and after approval of an exception under this section.</P>

If any other person has information of such violations, he/she may make a report thereof to the Inspector General or to any officer or employee of the Department.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Proceedings.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Upon a determination by the Assistant General Counsel, Business and Administrative Law Division, or his/her designee, after investigation by the Inspector General, that there is reasonable cause to believe that a former officer or employee, including a former special Government employee, of the Department of Health and Human Services (former departmental employee) has violated 18 US.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c), the Assistant General Counsel, or his/her designee, shall cause a copy of written charges of the violation(s) to be served upon such individual, either personally or by registered mail. The charges shall be accompanied by a notice to the former departmental employee to show cause within a specified time of not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice why he/she should not be prohibited from engaging in representational activities in relation to matters pending in the Department, as authorized by 18 U.S.C. 207(j), or subjected to other appropriate debarment or disqualification action under that statute. The notice to show cause shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement of allegations, and their bases, sufficiently detailed to enable the former departmental employee to prepare an adequate defense;</P>
            <P>(2) Notification of the right to a hearing, and that failure to answer shall constitute a waiver of defense; and</P>
            <P>(3) An explanation of the method by which a hearing may be requested.</P>
            <P>(b) If a former departmental employee who submits an answer to the notice to show cause does not request a hearing or if the Assistant General Counsel does not receive an answer within the time prescribed by the notice, the Assistant General Counsel shall forward the record, including the report(s) of investigation, to the Assistant Secretary for Personnel Administration (Assistant Secretary). In the case of a failure to answer, such failure shall constitute a waiver of defense.</P>
            <P>(c) Upon receipt of a former departmental employee's request for a hearing, the Assistant General Counsel shall notify him/her of the time and place thereof, giving due regard both to such person's need for an adequate period to prepare a suitable defense and an expeditious resolution of allegations that may be damaging to his or her reputation.</P>
            <P>(d) The presiding officer at the hearing and any related proceedings shall be a federal administrative law judge. He/she shall insure that the former departmental employee has the following rights:</P>
            <P>(1) To self-representation or representation by counsel,</P>
            <P>(2) To introduce and examine witnesses and submit physical evidence,</P>
            <P>(3) To confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses,</P>
            <P>(4) To present oral argument, and</P>
            <P>(5) To a transcript or recording of the proceedings, upon request.</P>
            <P>(e) The Assistant General Counsel shall designate one or more officers or employees of the Department to present the evidence against the former departmental employee and perform other functions incident to the proceedings.</P>

            <P>(f) A decision adverse to the former departmental employee must be sustained by substantial evidence that he/she violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c). If a judgment of conviction has been entered by a Federal district court against the former departmental employee for violation of 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c), regardless of whether the judgment is based upon a verdict or a plea of guilty, such judgment of conviction shall be conclusive evidence of a <PRTPAGE P="233"/>violation of 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c), unless and until the judgment is vacated or reversed on appeal.</P>
            <P>(g) The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision based exclusively on the transcript of testimony and exhibits, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, and shall set forth in the decision findings and conclusions, supported by reasons, on the material issues of fact and law presented on the record.</P>
            <P>(h) Within 30 days after issuance of the initial decision, either party may appeal in writing to the Assistant Secretary who in that event shall issue the final decision based on the record of the proceedings or those portions thereof cited by the parties to limit the issues. If the final decision modifies or reverses the initial decision, the Assistant Secretary shall specify the findings of fact and conclusions of law that vary from those of the presiding officer.</P>
            <P>(i) If a former departmental employee fails to appeal from an adverse initial decision within the prescribed period of time, the administrative law judge shall forward the record of the proceedings to the Assistant Secretary.</P>
            <P>(j) In the case of a former departmental employee who filed an answer to the notice to show cause but did not request a hearing, the Assistant Secretary shall make the final decision on the record submitted to him by the Assistant General Counsel pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(k) In a case where:</P>
            <P>(1) The defense has been waived,</P>
            <P>(2) The former departmental employee has failed to appeal from an adverse initial decision, or</P>
            <P>(3) The Assistant Secretary has issued a final decision that the former departmental employee violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c),</P>
            <FP>The Assistant Secretary may issue an order:</FP>
            <P>(i) Prohibiting the former departmental employee from making, on behalf of any other person (except the United States), any informal or formal appearance before, or, with the intent to influence, any oral or written communication to, the Department on a pending matter of business for a period not to exceed five years, or</P>
            <P>(ii) Prescribing other appropriate debarment or disqualification action, such as limiting the action to a particular organization or organizations within the Department.</P>
            <P>(l) An order issued under either paragraph (k)(i) or (k)(ii) of this section shall be supplemented by a directive to officers and employees of the Department not to engage in conduct in relation to the former departmental employee that would contravene such order.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 73b.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Hearings.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Hearings shall be stenographically recorded and transcribed and the testimony of witnesses shall be taken under oath or affirmation. Hearings will be closed unless an open hearing is requested by the respondent, except that if classified information or protected information of third parties is likely to be adduced at the hearing, it will remain closed. If either party to the proceeding fails to appear at the hearing, after due notice thereof has been sent to him/her, he/she shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the administrative law judge may make a decision on the basis of the record before him/her at that time.</P>
            <P>(b) The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law and equity are not controlling in hearings under this part. However, the administrative law judge shall exclude evidence which is irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious.</P>

            <P>(c) Depositions for use at a hearing may, with the consent of the parties in writing or the written approval of the administrative law judge be taken by either the Assistant General Counsel or the respondent or their duly authorized representatives. Depositions may be taken upon oral or written interrogatories. There shall be at least 10 days written notice to the other party. The requirement of a 10-day written notice may be waived by the parties in writing. When a deposition is taken upon written interrogatories, any cross-examination shall be upon written interrogatories. Copies of such written interrogatories shall be served upon the <PRTPAGE P="234"/>other party with the notice, and copies of any written cross-interrogation shall be mailed or delivered to the opposing party at least 5 days before the date of taking the depositions, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. Expenses in the reporting of depositions shall be borne by the party at whose instance the deposition is taken.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) This part establishes uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards to non-Federal entities, as described in § 75.101. HHS awarding agencies must not impose additional or inconsistent requirements, except as provided in §§ 75.102 and 75.210, or unless specifically required by Federal statute, regulation, or Executive Order.</P>
              <P>(2) This part provides the basis for a systematic and periodic collection and uniform submission by Federal agencies of information on all Federal financial assistance programs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). It also establishes Federal policies related to the delivery of this information to the public, including through the use of electronic media. It prescribes the manner in which General Services Administration (GSA), OMB, and Federal agencies that administer Federal financial assistance programs are to carry out their statutory responsibilities under the Federal Program Information Act (31 U.S.C. 6101-6106).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative requirements.</E> Subparts B through D of this part set forth the uniform administrative requirements for grant and cooperative agreements, including the requirements for HHS awarding agency management of Federal grant programs before the Federal award has been made, and the requirements HHS awarding agencies may impose on non-Federal entities in the Federal award.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Cost principles.</E> Subpart E of this part establishes principles for determining the allowable costs incurred by non-Federal entities under Federal awards. The principles are for the purpose of cost determination and are not intended to identify the circumstances or dictate the extent of Federal Government participation in the financing of a particular program or project. The principles are designed to provide that Federal awards bear their fair share of cost recognized under these principles except where restricted or prohibited by statute.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Single audit requirements and audit follow-up.</E> Subpart F of this part is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). It sets forth standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of non-Federal entities expending Federal awards. These provisions also provide the policies and procedures for HHS awarding agencies and pass-through entities when using the results of these audits.</P>
              <P>(e) For OMB guidance to Federal awarding agencies on Challenges and Prizes, please see M-10-11 Guidance on the Use of Challenges and Prizes to Promote Open Government, issued March 8, 2010, or its successor.</P>

This means that non-Federal entities must comply with requirements in this part regardless of whether the non-Federal entity is a recipient or subrecipient of a Federal award. Pass-through entities must comply with the requirements described in subpart D of this part, §§ 75.351 through 75.353, but not any requirements in this part directed towards Federal awarding agencies unless the requirements of this part or the terms and conditions of the Federal award indicate otherwise.

An HHS awarding agency may apply less restrictive requirements when making fixed amount awards as defined in subpart A of this part, except for those requirements imposed by statute or in subpart F of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) On a case-by-case basis, OMB will approve new strategies for Federal awards when proposed by the HHS awarding agency in accordance with OMB guidance (such as M-13-17) to develop additional evidence relevant to addressing important policy challenges or to promote cost-effectiveness in and across Federal programs. Proposals may draw on the innovative program designs discussed in M-13-17 to expand or improve the use of effective practices in delivering Federal financial assistance while also encouraging innovation in service delivery. Proposals submitted to OMB in accordance with M-13-17 may include requests to waive requirements other than those in subpart F of this part.</P>

              <P>(b) Fixed Amount Awards. In addition to the options described in paragraph (a) of this section, HHS awarding agencies, or pass-through entities as permitted in § 75.353, may use fixed amount awards (see § 75.2 <E T="03">Fixed amount awards</E>) to which the following conditions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) The Federal award amount is negotiated using the cost principles (or other pricing information) as a guide. The HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity may use fixed amount awards if the project scope is specific and if adequate cost, historical, or unit pricing data is available to establish a fixed amount award based on a reasonable estimate of actual cost. Payments are based on meeting specific requirements of the Federal award. Accountability is based on performance and results. Except in the case of termination before completion of the Federal award, there is no governmental review of the actual costs incurred by the non-Federal entity in performance of the award. Some of the ways in which the Federal award may be paid include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) In several partial payments, the amount of each agreed upon in advance, and the “milestone” or event triggering the payment also agreed upon in advance, and set forth in the Federal award;</P>
              <P>(ii) On a unit price basis, for a defined unit or units, at a defined price or prices, agreed to in advance of performance of the Federal award and set forth in the Federal award; or,</P>
              <P>(iii) In one payment at Federal award completion.</P>
              <P>(2) A fixed amount award cannot be used in programs which require mandatory cost sharing or match.</P>

              <P>(3) The non-Federal entity must certify in writing to the HHS awarding <PRTPAGE P="255"/>agency or pass-through entity at the end of the Federal award that the project or activity was completed or the level of effort was expended. If the required level of activity or effort was not carried out, the amount of the Federal award must be adjusted.</P>

              <P>For competitive grants or cooperative agreements, unless prohibited by Federal statute, the HHS awarding agency must design and execute a merit review process for applications. This process must be described or incorporated by reference in the applicable funding opportunity (see appendix I to this part.) See also § 75.203.</P>

              <SUBJECT>HHS awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Review of OMB-designated repositories of governmentwide data.</E> (1) Prior to making a Federal award, the HHS awarding agency is required by 31 U.S.C. 3321 and 41 U.S.C. 2313 note to review information available through any OMB-designated repositories of governmentwide eligibility qualification or financial integrity information as appropriate. See also suspension and debarment requirements at 2 CFR parts 180 and 376.</P>

              <P>(2) In accordance 41 U.S.C. 2313, the HHS awarding agency is required to review the non-public segment of the OMB-designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)) prior to making a Federal award where the Federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined in 41 U.S.C. 134, over the period of performance. At a minimum, the information in the system for a prior Federal award recipient must demonstrate a satisfactory record of executing programs or activities under Federal grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards; and integrity and business ethics. The HHS awarding agency may make a Federal award to a recipient who does not fully meet these standards, if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the current Federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the effects of <PRTPAGE P="257"/>the non-Federal entity's risk in accordance with § 75.207.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition, for competitive grants or cooperative agreements, the HHS awarding agency must have in place a framework for evaluating the risks posed by applicants before they receive Federal awards. This evaluation may incorporate results of the evaluation of the applicant's eligibility or the quality of its application. If the HHS awarding agency determines that a Federal award will be made, special conditions that correspond to the degree of risk assessed may be applied to the Federal award. Criteria to be evaluated must be described in the announcement of funding opportunity described in § 75.203.</P>
              <P>(c) In evaluating risks posed by applicants, the HHS awarding agency may use a risk-based approach and may consider any items such as the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Financial stability;</P>
              <P>(2) Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part;</P>
              <P>(3) History of performance. The applicant's record in managing Federal awards, if it is a prior recipient of Federal awards, including timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements, conformance to the terms and conditions of previous Federal awards, and if applicable, the extent to which any previously awarded amounts will be expended prior to future awards;</P>
              <P>(4) Reports and findings from audits performed under subpart F of this part or the reports and findings of any other available audits; and</P>
              <P>(5) The applicant's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on non-Federal entities.</P>
              <P>(d) In addition to this review, the HHS awarding agency must comply with the guidelines on government-wide suspension and debarment in 2 CFR part 180, and must require non-Federal entities to comply with these provisions. These provisions restrict Federal awards, subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal programs or activities.</P>

Alternative mechanisms may be used for formula grant programs which do not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.</P>
              <P>(1) Applicants shall use the SF-424 series or those forms and instructions prescribed by the HHS awarding agency.</P>
              <P>(2) For Federal programs covered by Executive Order 12372, as amended by Executive Order 12416, the applicant shall complete the appropriate sections of the SF-424 indicating whether the application was subject to review by the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address of the SPOC for a particular State can be obtained from the HHS awarding agency or the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The SPOC shall advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made has been selected by that State for review. (See also 45 CFR part 100.)</P>

              <P>(3) HHS awarding agencies that do not use the SF-424 series will indicate <PRTPAGE P="258"/>on the application form they prescribe whether the application is subject to review by the State under Executive Order 12372.</P>

Under regulations implementing Executive Order 12372, States are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations implementing Executive Order 12372.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> A State need meet only Federal administrative or programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Assurances.</E> In each plan, the State will include an assurance that the State will comply with all applicable Federal statutes and regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in this plan, the State may:</P>
              <P>(i) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those provisions,</P>
              <P>(ii) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or</P>
              <P>(iii) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Amendments.</E> A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to reflect:</P>
              <P>(i) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations, or</P>
              <P>(ii) A material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency operation. The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its effective date but need submit for approval only the amended portions of the plan.</P>

              <P>(a) If an HHS awarding agency does not make a Federal award to a non-Federal entity because the official determines that the non-Federal entity does not meet either or both of the minimum qualification standards as described in § 75.205(a)(2), the HHS awarding agency must report that determination to the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS), only if all of the following apply:</P>

              <P>(1) The only basis for the determination described in paragraph (a) of this section is the non-Federal entity's prior record of executing programs or activities under Federal awards or its record of integrity and business ethics, as described in § 75.205(a)(2), (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the entity was determined to be qualified based on all factors other than those two standards), and</P>

              <P>(2) The total Federal share of the Federal award that otherwise would be <PRTPAGE P="261"/>made to the non-Federal entity is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance.</P>
              <P>(b) The HHS awarding agency is not required to report a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award if it makes the Federal award to the non-Federal entity and includes specific award terms and conditions, as described in § 75.207.</P>
              <P>(c) If an HHS awarding agency reports a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the HHS awarding agency also must notify the non-Federal entity that—</P>
              <P>(1) The determination was made and reported to the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM, and include with the notification an explanation of the basis for the determination;</P>
              <P>(2) The information will be kept in the system for a period of five years from the date of the determination, as required by section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313), then archived;</P>
              <P>(3) Each HHS awarding agency that considers making a Federal award to the non-Federal entity during that five year period must consider that information in judging whether the non-Federal entity is qualified to receive the Federal award when the total Federal share of the Federal award is expected to include an amount of Federal funding in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance;</P>
              <P>(4) The non-Federal entity may go to the awardee integrity and performance portal accessible through SAM (currently the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS)) and comment on any information the system contains about the non-Federal entity itself; and</P>
              <P>(5) HHS awarding agencies will consider that non-Federal entity's comments in determining whether the non-Federal entity is qualified for the future Federal award.</P>
              <P>(d) If an HHS awarding agency enters information into the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM about a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award and subsequently:</P>
              <P>(1) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the HHS awarding agency must correct the information in the system within three business days;</P>
              <P>(2) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal awarding agencies, the HHS awarding agency is strongly encouraged to amend the information in the system to incorporate the update in a timely way.</P>
              <P>(e) HHS awarding agencies shall not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public segment of the designated integrity and performance system that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. If the recipient asserts within seven calendar days to the HHS awarding agency that posted the information that some or all of the information made publicly available is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, the HHS awarding agency that posted the information must remove the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Prior to reposting the releasable information, the HHS awarding agency must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of Information Act procedures.</P>

              <P>(2) No salary or fringe benefit payments may be made from HHS awarding agency grant funds to support career, career-conditional, or other Federal employees (civilian or uniformed services) without permanent appointments at a Federal institution receiving a grant. While the level of effort required for the project must be allowed by the recipient as part of each individual's official duties, salary costs associated with an individual participating in an official capacity as a Federal employee under a grant to that Federal institution are not allowable costs under an HHS awarding agency grant.</P>

                <P>(a) The Federal awarding agency must manage and administer the Federal award in a manner so as to ensure that Federal funding is expended and associated programs are implemented in full accordance with U.S. statutory and public policy requirements: Including, but not limited to, those protecting public welfare, the environment, and prohibiting discrimination. The Federal awarding agency must communicate to the non-Federal entity all relevant public policy requirements, including those in general appropriations provisions, and incorporate them either directly or by reference in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(b) The non-Federal entity is responsible for complying with all requirements of the Federal award. For all Federal awards, this includes the provisions of FFATA, which includes requirements on executive compensation, and also requirements implementing the Act for the non-Federal entity at 2 CFR part 25 and 2 CFR part 170. See also statutory requirements for whistleblower protections at 10 U.S.C. 2324 and 2409, and 41 U.S.C. 4304, 4310, and 4712.</P>

Recipients must comply with this public policy requirement in the administration of programs supported by HHS awards.</P>

As appropriate and in accordance with above mentioned information collections, the HHS awarding agency must require the recipient to relate financial data to performance accomplishments of the Federal award. Also, in accordance with above mentioned standard information collections, and when applicable, recipients must also provide cost information to demonstrate cost effective practices (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> through unit cost data). The recipient's performance should be measured in a way that will help the HHS awarding agency and other non-Federal entities to improve program outcomes, share lessons learned, and spread the adoption of promising practices. The HHS awarding agency should provide recipients with clear performance goals, indicators, and milestones as described in § 75.210. Performance reporting frequency and content should be established to not only allow the HHS awarding agency to understand the recipient progress but also to facilitate identification of promising practices among recipients and build the evidence upon which the HHS awarding agency's program and performance decisions are made.</P>

                <P>(a) Each state must expend and account for the Federal award in accordance with state laws and procedures for expending and accounting for the state's own funds. In addition, the <PRTPAGE P="264"/>state's and the other non- Federal entity's financial management systems, including records documenting compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award, must be sufficient to permit the preparation of reports required by general and program-specific terms and conditions; and the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate to establish that such funds have been used according to the Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See also § 75.450.</P>
                <P>(b) The financial management system of each non-Federal entity must provide for the following (see also §§ 75.361, 75.362, 75.363, 75.364, and 75.365):</P>
                <P>(1) Identification, in its accounts, of all Federal awards received and expended and the Federal programs under which they were received. Federal program and Federal award identification must include, as applicable, the CFDA title and number, Federal award identification number and year, name of the HHS awarding agency, and name of the pass-through entity, if any.</P>
                <P>(2) Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of each Federal award or program in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in §§ 75.341 and 75.342. If an HHS awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient must not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. This recipient may develop accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand. Similarly, a pass-through entity must not require a subrecipient to establish an accrual accounting system and must allow the subrecipient to develop accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.</P>
                <P>(3) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-funded activities. These records must contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, expenditures, income and interest and be supported by source documentation.</P>
                <P>(4) Effective control over, and accountability for, all funds, property, and other assets. The non-Federal entity must adequately safeguard all assets and assure that they are used solely for authorized purposes. See § 75.303.</P>
                <P>(5) Comparison of expenditures with budget amounts for each Federal award.</P>
                <P>(6) Written procedures to implement the requirements of § 75.305.</P>
                <P>(7) Written procedures for determining the allowability of costs in accordance with subpart E of this part and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.</P>

                <P>(a) Establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. These internal controls should be in compliance with guidance in “Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,” issued by the Comptroller General of the United States or the “Internal Control Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).</P>
                <P>(b) Comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal awards.</P>
                <P>(c) Evaluate and monitor the non-Federal entity's compliance with statutes, regulations and the terms and conditions of Federal awards.</P>
                <P>(d) Take prompt action when instances of noncompliance are identified including noncompliance identified in audit findings.</P>
                <P>(e) Take reasonable measures to safeguard protected personally identifiable information and other information the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity designates as sensitive or the non-Federal entity considers sensitive consistent with applicable Federal, state, local, and tribal laws regarding privacy and obligations of confidentiality.</P>

                <P>(a) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the HHS awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the non-Federal entity are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.</P>
                <P>(b) The HHS awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the non-Federal entity lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.</P>
                <P>(c) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds must be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Payment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a)(1) For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205 and TFM 4A-2000 Overall Disbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies.</P>
                <P>(2) To the extent that Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures do not address expenditure of program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds, such funds must be expended before requesting additional cash payments.</P>
                <P>(b) For non-Federal entities other than states, payments methods must minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury or the pass-through entity and the disbursement by the non-Federal entity whether the payment is made by electronic funds transfer, or issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means. See also § 75.302(b)(6). Except as noted elsewhere in this part, HHS awarding agencies must require recipients to use only OMB-approved standard governmentwide information collection requests to request payment.</P>
                <P>(1) The non-Federal entity must be paid in advance, provided it maintains or demonstrates the willingness to maintain both written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the non-Federal entity, and financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in this part. Advance payments to a non-Federal entity must be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the non-Federal entity in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of advance payments must be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the non-Federal entity for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs. The non-Federal entity must make timely payment to contractors in accordance with the contract provisions.</P>
                <P>(2) Whenever possible, advance payments must be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all Federal awards made by the HHS awarding agency to the recipient.</P>
                <P>(i) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer and must comply with applicable guidance in 31 CFR part 208.</P>
                <P>(ii) Non-Federal entities must be authorized to submit requests for advance payments and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used, and as often as they like when electronic transfers are used, in accordance with the provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).</P>

                <P>(3) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met, when the HHS awarding agency sets a specific condition per § 75.207, or when the non-Federal entity requests payment by reimbursement. This method may be used on any Federal award for construction, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal award constitutes a minor portion of the project. <PRTPAGE P="266"/>When the reimbursement method is used, the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the billing, unless the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity reasonably believes the request to be improper.</P>
                <P>(4) If the non-Federal entity cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the non-Federal entity lacks sufficient working capital, the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity must advance cash payments to the non-Federal entity to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the non-Federal entity's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity must reimburse the non-Federal entity for its actual cash disbursements. Use of the working capital advance method of payment requires that the pass-through entity provide timely advance payments to any subrecipients in order to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment must not be used by the pass-through entity if the reason for using this method is the unwillingness or inability of the pass-through entity to provide timely advance payments to the subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.</P>
                <P>(5) Use of resources before requesting cash advance payments. To the extent available, the non-Federal entity must disburse funds available from program income (including repayments to a revolving fund), rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.</P>
                <P>(6) Unless otherwise required by Federal statutes, payments for allowable costs by non-Federal entities must not be withheld at any time during the period of performance unless the conditions of §§ 75.207, subpart D of this part, 75.371, or one or more of the following applies:</P>
                <P>(i) The non-Federal entity has failed to comply with the project objectives, Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(ii) The non-Federal entity is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Guidance A-129 “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables.”</P>
                <P>(iii) A payment withheld for failure to comply with Federal award conditions, but without suspension of the Federal award, must be released to the non-Federal entity upon subsequent compliance. When a Federal award is suspended, payment adjustments will be made in accordance with § 75.375.</P>
                <P>(iv) A payment must not be made to a non-Federal entity for amounts that are withheld by the non-Federal entity from payment to contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. A payment must be made when the non-Federal entity actually disburses the withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to assure satisfactory completion of work.</P>
                <P>(7) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of advance payments under Federal awards are as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) The HHS awarding agency and pass-through entity must not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a non-Federal entity or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to the non-Federal entity. However, the non-Federal entity must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.</P>
                <P>(ii) Advance payments of Federal funds must be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.</P>
                <P>(8) The non-Federal entity must maintain advance payments of Federal awards in interest-bearing accounts, unless the following apply:</P>
                <P>(i) The non-Federal entity receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.</P>
                <P>(ii) The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on Federal cash balances.</P>

                <P>(iii) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high <PRTPAGE P="267"/>that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.</P>
                <P>(iv) A foreign government or banking system prohibits or precludes interest bearing accounts.</P>

                <P>(9) Interest earned amounts up to $500 per year may be retained by the non-Federal entity for administrative expense. Any additional interest earned on Federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment Management System (PMS) through an electronic medium using either Automated Clearing House (ACH) network or a Fedwire Funds Service payment. Remittances must include pertinent information of the payee and nature of the payment in the memo area (often referred to as “addenda records” by Financial Institutions) as that will assist in the timely posting of interest earned on federal funds. Pertinent details include the Payee Account Number (PAN) if the payment originated from PMS, or Agency information, if the payment originated from ASAP, NSF or another federal agency payment system. The remittance must be submitted as follows:

                <SECTNO>§ 75.306</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Cost sharing or matching.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Under Federal research proposals, voluntary committed cost sharing is not expected. It cannot be used as a factor during the merit review of applications or proposals, but may be considered if it is both in accordance with HHS awarding agency regulations and specified in a notice of funding opportunity. Criteria for considering voluntary committed cost sharing and any other program policy factors that may be used to determine who may receive a Federal award must be explicitly described in the notice of funding opportunity. Furthermore, only mandatory cost sharing or cost sharing specifically committed in the project budget must be included in the organized research base for computing the indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate or reflected in any allocation of indirect costs. See also §§ 75.414, 75.203, and appendix I to this part.</P>
                <P>(b) For all Federal awards, any shared costs or matching funds and all contributions, including cash and third party in-kind contributions, must be accepted as part of the non-Federal entity's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(1) Are verifiable from the non-Federal entity's records;</P>
                <P>(2) Are not included as contributions for any other Federal award;</P>
                <P>(3) Are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of project or program objectives;</P>
                <P>(4) Are allowable under subpart E of this part;</P>

                <P>(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another Federal award, <PRTPAGE P="268"/>except where the Federal statute authorizing a program specifically provides that Federal funds made available for such program can be applied to matching or cost sharing requirements of other Federal programs;</P>
                <P>(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the HHS awarding agency; and</P>
                <P>(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.</P>
                <P>(c) Unrecovered indirect costs, including indirect costs on cost sharing or matching may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with prior approval of the HHS awarding agency. Unrecovered indirect cost means the difference between the amount charged to the Federal award and the amount which could have been charged to the Federal award under the non-Federal entity's approved negotiated indirect cost rate.</P>
                <P>(d) Values for non-Federal entity contributions of services and property must be established in accordance with the cost principles in subpart E. If an HHS awarding agency authorizes the non-Federal entity to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching must be the lesser of paragraphs (d)(1) or (2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) The value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the non-Federal entity's accounting records at the time of donation.</P>
                <P>(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the HHS awarding agency may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the value described in paragraph (1) of this section at the time of donation.</P>
                <P>(e) Volunteer services furnished by third-party professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for third-party volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work by the non-Federal entity. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the non-Federal entity, rates must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the non-Federal entity competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, necessary, allocable, and otherwise allowable may be included in the valuation.</P>
                <P>(f) When a third-party organization furnishes the services of an employee, these services must be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay plus an amount of fringe benefits that is reasonable, necessary, allocable, and otherwise allowable, and indirect costs at either the third-party organization's approved federally negotiated indirect cost rate or, a rate in accordance with § 75.414(f), provided these services employ the same skill(s) for which the employee is normally paid. Where donated services are treated as indirect costs, indirect cost rates will separate the value of the donated services so that reimbursement for the donated services will not be made.</P>
                <P>(g) Donated property from third parties may include such items as equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies, or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated property included in the cost sharing or matching share must not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.</P>
                <P>(h) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for third-party-donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the non-Federal entity may differ according to the purpose of the Federal award, if paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section applies.</P>
                <P>(1) If the purpose of the Federal award is to assist the non-Federal entity in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the aggregate value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.</P>

                <P>(2) If the purpose of the Federal award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the HHS <PRTPAGE P="269"/>awarding agency has approved the charges. See also § 75.420.</P>
                <P>(i) The value of donated property must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the non-Federal entity, with the following qualifications:</P>

                <P>(1) The value of donated land and buildings must not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the non-Federal entity as established by an independent appraiser (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the non-Federal entity as required by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) (Uniform Act) except as provided in the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.</P>
                <P>(2) The value of donated equipment must not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of donation.</P>
                <P>(3) The value of donated space must not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.</P>
                <P>(4) The value of loaned equipment must not exceed its fair rental value.</P>
                <P>(j) For third-party in-kind contributions, the fair market value of goods and services must be documented and to the extent feasible supported by the same methods used internally by the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(k) For IHEs, see also OMB memorandum M-01-06, dated January 5, 2001, Clarification of OMB A-21 Treatment of Voluntary Uncommitted Cost Sharing and Tuition Remission Costs.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Program income.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Non-Federal entities are encouraged to earn income to defray program costs where appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cost of generating program income.</E> If authorized by Federal regulations or the Federal award, costs incidental to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Governmental revenues.</E> Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a non-Federal entity are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the Federal award or HHS awarding agency regulations as program income.</P>
                <P>(1) The Patent and Trademark Laws Amendments, 34 U.S.C. 200-212, apply to inventions made under an award for performance of experimental, developmental, or research work.</P>
                <P>(2) Unless the terms and conditions for the Federal award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to HHS with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions made under a Federal award. However, no scholarship, fellowship, training grant, or other funding agreement made primarily to a recipient for educational purposes will contain any provision giving the HHS awarding agency rights to inventions made by the recipient.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Property.</E> Proceeds from the sale of real property, equipment, or supplies, are not program income; such proceeds will be handled in accordance with the requirements of subpart D of this part, §§ 75.318, 75.320, and 75.321, or as specifically identified in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of program income.</E> If the HHS awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award, or give prior approval for how program income is to be used, paragraph (e)(1) of this section must apply. For Federal awards made to IHEs and nonprofit research institutions, if the HHS awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award how program income is to be used, paragraph (e)(2) of this section must apply unless the recipient is subject to conditions under § 75.207 or § 75.216. In specifying alternatives to paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, <PRTPAGE P="270"/>the HHS awarding agency may distinguish between income earned by the recipient and income earned by subrecipients and between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When the HHS awarding agency authorizes the approaches in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, program income in excess of any amounts specified must also be deducted from expenditures.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Deduction.</E> Ordinarily program income must be deducted from total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income must be used for current costs unless the HHS awarding agency authorizes otherwise. Program income that the non-Federal entity did not anticipate at the time of the Federal award must be used to reduce the Federal award and non-Federal entity contributions rather than to increase the funds committed to the project.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Addition.</E> With prior approval of the HHS awarding agency (except for IHEs and nonprofit research institutions, as described in paragraph (e) of this section), program income may be added to the Federal award by the Federal agency and the non-Federal entity. The program income must be used for the purposes and under the conditions of the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Cost sharing or matching.</E> With prior approval of the HHS awarding agency, program income may be used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the Federal award. The amount of the Federal award remains the same.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Income after the period of performance.</E> There are no Federal requirements governing the disposition of income earned after the end of the period of performance for the Federal award, unless the HHS awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise. The HHS awarding agency may negotiate agreements with recipients regarding appropriate uses of income earned after the period of performance as part of the grant closeout process. See also § 75.381.</P>
                <P>(g) Unless the Federal statute, regulations, or terms and conditions for the Federal award provide otherwise, the non-Federal entity has no obligation to the HHS awarding agency with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions made under a Federal award to which 37 CFR part 401, “Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms under Government Awards, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements” is applicable.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Revision of budget and program plans.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) The approved budget for the Federal award summarizes the financial aspects of the project or program as approved during the Federal award process. It may include either the Federal and non-Federal share (see § 75.2 <E T="03">Federal share</E>) or only the Federal share, depending upon HHS awarding agency requirements. It must be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget or project scope or objective, and request prior approvals from HHS awarding agencies for budget and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) For non-construction Federal awards, recipients must request prior approvals from HHS awarding agencies for one or more of the following program or budget-related reasons:</P>
                <P>(i) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).</P>
                <P>(ii) Change in a key person specified in the application or the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(iii) The disengagement from the project for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator.</P>
                <P>(iv) The inclusion, unless waived by the HHS awarding agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with subpart E of this part, or appendix IX of this part, or 48 CFR part 31, as applicable.</P>

                <P>(v) The transfer of funds budgeted for participant support costs as defined in § 75.2 to other categories of expense.<PRTPAGE P="271"/>
                </P>
                <P>(vi) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved Federal awards, the subawarding, transferring or contracting out of any work under a Federal award, including fixed amount subawards as described in § 75.353. This provision does not apply to the acquisition of supplies, material, equipment or general support services.</P>
                <P>(vii) Changes in the approved cost-sharing or matching provided by the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(viii) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.</P>
                <P>(ix) The inclusion of research patient care costs in research awards made for the performance of research work.</P>
                <P>(x) The provision of subawards by a pass-through entity on fixed amounts up to the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, provided that the subawards meet the requirements for fixed amount awards in § 75.201. See § 75.353.</P>
                <P>(xi) The recipient wishes to dispose of, replace, or encumber title to real property, equipment, or intangible property that are acquired or improved with a Federal award. See §§ 75.318, 75.320, 75.322, and 75.323.</P>
                <P>(2) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless an exception has been approved by OMB. See also §§ 75.102 and 75.407.</P>
                <P>(d) Except for requirements listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the HHS awarding agencies are authorized, at their option, to waive prior written approvals required by paragraph (c) this section. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following:</P>

                <P>(1) Incur project costs 90 calendar days before the HHS awarding agency makes the Federal award. Expenses more than 90 calendar days pre-award require prior approval of the HHS awarding agency. All costs incurred before the HHS awarding agency makes the Federal award are at the recipient's risk (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the HHS awarding agency is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive a Federal award or if the Federal award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs). See also § 75.458.</P>
                <P>(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the period of performance by up to 12 months unless one or more of the conditions outlined in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the HHS awarding agency in writing with the supporting reasons and revised period of performance at least 10 calendar days before the end of the period of performance specified in the Federal award. This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. Extensions require explicit prior HHS awarding agency approval when:</P>
                <P>(i) The terms and conditions of the Federal award prohibit the extension.</P>
                <P>(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.</P>
                <P>(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.</P>
                <P>(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent periods of performance.</P>

                <P>(4) For Federal awards that support research, unless the HHS awarding agency provides otherwise in the Federal award or in the HHS awarding agency's regulations, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (d) are automatically waived (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (d)(2) applies.</P>
                <P>(e) The HHS awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for Federal awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the HHS awarding agency. The HHS awarding agency cannot permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the appropriation.</P>

                <P>(f) All other changes to non-construction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (c) of this section, do not require prior approval (see also § 75.407).<PRTPAGE P="272"/>
                </P>
                <P>(g) For construction Federal awards, the recipient must request prior written approval promptly from the HHS awarding agency for budget revisions whenever paragraph (g)(1), (2), or (3) of this section applies.</P>
                <P>(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program.</P>
                <P>(2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.</P>
                <P>(3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in subpart E of this part.</P>
                <P>(4) No other prior approval requirements for budget revisions may be imposed unless an exception has been approved by OMB.</P>
                <P>(5) When an HHS awarding agency makes a Federal award that provides support for construction and non-construction work, the HHS awarding agency may require the recipient to obtain prior approval from the HHS awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.</P>
                <P>(h) When requesting approval for budget revisions, the recipient must use the same format for budget information that was used in the application, unless the HHS awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.</P>
                <P>(i) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, the HHS awarding agency must review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the HHS awarding agency must inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.</P>
                <P>(j) All approvals granted in keeping with the provisions of this section shall not be valid unless they are in writing, and signed by at least one of the following HHS officials:</P>
                <P>(1) The Head of the HHS awarding agency that made the award or subordinate official with proper delegated authority from the Head, including the Head of the Regional Office of the HHS awarding agency that made the award; or</P>
                <P>(2) The responsible Grants Officer of the HHS awarding agency that made the award or an individual duly authorized by the Grants Officer.</P>

                <P>(a) A non-Federal entity may charge to the Federal award only allowable costs incurred during the period of performance (except as described in § 75.461) and any costs incurred before the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity made the Federal award that were authorized by the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. Funds available to pay allowable costs during the period of performance include both Federal funds awarded and carryover balances.</P>
                <P>(b) A non-Federal entity must liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to coincide with the submission of the final Federal Financial Report (FFR). This deadline may be extended with prior written approval from the HHS awarding agency.</P>

                <P>Sections 75.317 through 75.323 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished by HHS or whose cost was charged directly to a project supported by an HHS award. The HHS awarding agency may not impose additional requirements, unless specifically required to do so by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided they meet the provisions of these sections.</P>

                <P>The non-Federal entity must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved with Federal funds as provided to other <PRTPAGE P="273"/>property owned by the non-Federal entity. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Real property.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Title.</E> Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to real property acquired or improved under a Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Use.</E> (1) Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes or by the HHS awarding agency, real property will be used for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose, during which time the non-Federal entity must not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.</P>

                <P>(2) The non-Federal entity shall obtain written approval from the HHS awarding agency for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> awards) or programs that have purpose consistent with those authorized for support by the HHS awarding agency.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Disposition.</E> When real property is no longer needed as provided in subsection (b), the non-Federal entity must obtain disposition instructions from the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity. The instructions must provide for one of the following alternatives:</P>
                <P>(1) Retain title after compensating the HHS awarding agency. The amount paid to the HHS awarding agency will be computed by applying the HHS awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase (and costs of any improvements) to the fair market value of the property. However, in those situations where the non-Federal entity is disposing of real property acquired or improved with a Federal award and acquiring replacement real property under the same Federal award, the net proceeds from the disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.</P>
                <P>(2) Sell the property and compensate the HHS awarding agency. The amount due to the HHS awarding agency will be calculated by applying the HHS awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase (and cost of any improvements) to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the Federal award has not been closed out, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the original cost of the property. When the non-Federal entity is directed to sell property, sales procedures must be followed that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.</P>
                <P>(3) Transfer title to the HHS awarding agency or to a third party designated/approved by the HHS awarding agency. The non-Federal entity is entitled to be paid an amount calculated by applying the non-Federal entity's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real property (and cost of any improvements) to the current fair market value of the property.</P>

                <P>(a) Title to Federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. The non-Federal entity must submit annually an inventory listing of Federally-owned property in its custody to the HHS awarding agency. Upon completion of the Federal award or when the property is no longer needed, the non-Federal entity must report the property to the HHS awarding agency for further Federal agency utilization.</P>

                <P>(b) If the HHS awarding agency has no further need for the property, it must declare the property excess and report it for disposal to the appropriate Federal disposal authority, unless the HHS awarding agency has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (i)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with Executive Order 12999). The HHS awarding agency must <PRTPAGE P="274"/>issue appropriate instructions to the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(c) Exempt Federally-owned property means property acquired under a Federal award where the HHS awarding agency has chosen to vest title to the property to the non-Federal entity without further obligation to the Federal Government, based upon the explicit terms and conditions of the Federal award. The HHS awarding agency may exercise this option when statutory authority exists. Absent statutory authority and specific terms and conditions of the Federal award, title to exempt Federally-owned property acquired under the Federal award remains with the Federal Government.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Title.</E> Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to equipment acquired under a Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the non-Federal entity. Unless a statute specifically authorizes the Federal agency to vest title in the non-Federal entity without further obligation to the Federal Government, and the Federal agency elects to do so, the title must be a conditional title. Title must vest in the non-Federal entity subject to the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(1) Use the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project during the period of performance, or until the property is no longer needed for the purposes of the project.</P>
                <P>(2) Not encumber the property without approval of the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity.</P>
                <P>(3) Use and dispose of the property in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c) and (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) A state must use, manage and dispose of equipment acquired under a Federal award by the state in accordance with state laws and procedures. Other non-Federal entities must follow paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Use.</E> (1) Equipment must be used by the non-Federal entity in the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by the Federal award, and the non-Federal entity must not encumber the property without prior approval of the HHS awarding agency. When no longer needed for the original program or project, the equipment may be used in other activities supported by the HHS awarding agency, in the following order of priority:</P>
                <P>(i) Activities under a Federal award from the HHS awarding agency which funded the original program or project, then</P>
                <P>(ii) Activities under Federal awards from other HHS awarding agencies. This includes consolidated equipment for information technology systems.</P>
                <P>(2) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the non-Federal entity must also make the equipment available for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported by the Federal Government, provided that such use will not interfere with the work on the projects or program for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use must be given to other programs or projects supported by the HHS awarding agency that financed the equipment and second preference must be given to programs or projects under Federal awards from other Federal awarding agencies. Use for non-federally-funded programs or projects is also permissible. User fees should be considered if appropriate.</P>
                <P>(3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in § 75.307 to earn program income, the non-Federal entity must not use equipment acquired with the Federal award to provide services for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services unless specifically authorized by Federal statute for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.</P>
                <P>(4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the non-Federal entity may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property subject to the approval of the HHS awarding agency.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Management requirements.</E> Procedures for managing equipment (including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part under a Federal award, until disposition takes <PRTPAGE P="275"/>place will, as a minimum, meet the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(1) Property records must be maintained that include a description of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the source of funding for the property (including the FAIN), who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of the property, percentage of Federal participation in the project costs for the Federal award under which the property was acquired, the location, use and condition of the property, and any ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price of the property.</P>
                <P>(2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years.</P>
                <P>(3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or theft must be investigated.</P>
                <P>(4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the property in good condition.</P>
                <P>(5) If the non-Federal entity is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the highest possible return.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Disposition.</E> When original or replacement equipment acquired under a Federal award is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by a HHS awarding agency, except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulations, or HHS awarding agency disposition instructions, the non-Federal entity must request disposition instructions from the HHS awarding agency if required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Disposition of the equipment will be made as follows, in accordance with HHS awarding agency disposition instructions:</P>
                <P>(1) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or less may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the HHS awarding agency.</P>
                <P>(2) Except as provided in § 75.319(b), or if the HHS awarding agency fails to provide requested disposition instructions within 120 days, items of equipment with a current per-unit fair-market value in excess of $5,000 may be retained by the non-Federal entity or sold. The HHS awarding agency is entitled to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value or proceeds from sale by the HHS awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase. If the equipment is sold, the HHS awarding agency may permit the non-Federal entity to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for its selling and handling expenses.</P>
                <P>(3) The non-Federal entity may transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the non-Federal entity must be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.</P>
                <P>(4) In cases where a non-Federal entity fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the HHS awarding agency may direct the non-Federal entity to take disposition actions.</P>

If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are not needed for any other Federal award, the non-Federal entity must retain the supplies for use on other activities or sell them, but must, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation must be computed in the same manner as for equipment. See § 75.320(e)(2) for the calculation methodology.</P>
                <P>(b) As long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies, the non-Federal entity must not use supplies acquired under a Federal award to provide services to other organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute.</P>

The non-Federal entity must use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and must not encumber the property without approval of the HHS awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property must occur in accordance with the provisions in § 75.320(e).</P>
                <P>(b) The non-Federal entity may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was acquired, under a Federal award. The HHS awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.</P>

                <P>(2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).</E> (1) In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for research data relating to published research findings produced under a Federal award that were used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law, the HHS awarding agency must request, and the non-Federal entity must provide, within a reasonable time, the research data so that they can be made available to the public through the procedures established under the FOIA. If the HHS awarding agency obtains the research data solely in response to a FOIA request, the HHS awarding agency may charge the requester a reasonable fee equaling the full incremental cost of obtaining the research data. This fee should reflect costs incurred by the Federal agency and the non-Federal entity. This fee is in addition to any fees the HHS awarding agency may assess under the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)).</P>
                <P>(2) Published research findings means when:</P>
                <P>(i) Research findings are published in a peer-reviewed scientific or technical journal; or</P>
                <P>(ii) A Federal agency publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law. “Used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law” is defined as when an agency publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law.</P>

                <P>(3) Research data means the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: Preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues. This “recorded” material excludes physical objects (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> laboratory samples). Research data also do not include:</P>
                <P>(i) Trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be held confidential by a researcher until they are published, or similar information which is protected under law; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Personnel and medical information and similar information the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, such as information that could be used to identify a particular person in a research study.</P>

The state will comply with § 75.331 and ensure that every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by § 75.335. All other non-Federal entities, including subrecipients of a state, will follow §§ 75.327 through 75.335.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General procurement standards.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The non-Federal entity must use its own documented procurement procedures which reflect applicable State, local, and tribal laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this part.</P>
                <P>(b) Non-Federal entities must maintain oversight to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) The non-Federal entity must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the actions of its employees engaged in the selection, award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by a Federal award if he or she has a real or apparent conflict of interest. Such a conflict of interest would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a firm considered for a contract. The officers, employees, and agents of the non-Federal entity may neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or parties to subcontracts. However, non-Federal entities may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct must provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(2) If the non-Federal entity has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a state, local government, or Indian tribe, the non-Federal entity must also maintain written standards of conduct covering organizational conflicts of interest. Organizational conflicts of interest means that because of relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, the non-Federal entity is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a procurement action involving a related organization.</P>
                <P>(d) The non-Federal entity's procedures must avoid acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.</P>
                <P>(e) To foster greater economy and efficiency, and in accordance with efforts to promote cost-effective use of shared services across the Federal Government, the non-Federal entity is encouraged to enter into state and local intergovernmental agreements or inter-entity agreements where appropriate for procurement or use of common or shared goods and services.</P>
                <P>(f) The non-Federal entity is encouraged to use Federal excess and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.</P>

                <P>(g) The non-Federal entity is encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for construction projects <PRTPAGE P="278"/>of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower cost.</P>
                <P>(h) The non-Federal entity must award contracts only to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources. See also § 75.213.</P>
                <P>(i) The non-Federal entity must maintain records sufficient to detail the history of procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.</P>
                <P>(j)(1) The non-Federal entity may use a time and materials type contract only after a determination that no other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Time and materials type contract means a contract whose cost to a non-Federal entity is the sum of:</P>
                <P>(i) The actual cost of materials; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Direct labor hours charged at fixed hourly rates that reflect wages, general and administrative expenses, and profit.</P>
                <P>(2) Since this formula generates an open-ended contract price, a time-and-materials contract provides no positive profit incentive to the contractor for cost control or labor efficiency. Therefore, each contract must set a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Further, the non-Federal entity awarding such a contract must assert a high degree of oversight in order to obtain reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls.</P>
                <P>(k) The non-Federal entity alone must be responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These standards do not relieve the non-Federal entity of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. The HHS awarding agency will not substitute its judgment for that of the non-Federal entity unless the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local, tribal, state, or Federal authority having proper jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(l) The type of procuring instruments used must be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved.</P>

                <P>(1) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business;</P>
                <P>(2) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding;</P>
                <P>(3) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies;</P>
                <P>(4) Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer contracts;</P>
                <P>(5) Organizational conflicts of interest;</P>
                <P>(6) Specifying only a “brand name” product instead of allowing “an equal” product to be offered and describing the performance or other relevant requirements of the procurement; and</P>
                <P>(7) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.</P>

                <P>(b) The non-Federal entity must conduct procurements in a manner that <PRTPAGE P="279"/>prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed state, local, or tribal geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this section preempts state licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be a selection criterion provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.</P>
                <P>(c) The non-Federal entity must have written procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures must ensure that all solicitations:</P>
                <P>(1) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description must not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured and, when necessary, must set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a “brand name or equivalent” description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of procurement. The specific features of the named brand which must be met by offers must be clearly stated; and</P>
                <P>(2) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.</P>
                <P>(d) The non-Federal entity must ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition. Also, the non-Federal entity must not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Procurement procedures.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The non-Federal entity must use one of the following methods of procurement.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Procurement by micro-purchases.</E> Procurement by micro-purchase is the acquisition of supplies or services, the aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold (<E T="03">See micro-purchase</E>). To the extent practicable, the non-Federal entity must distribute micro-purchases equitably among qualified suppliers. Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting competitive quotations if the non-Federal entity considers the price to be reasonable.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Procurement by small purchase procedures.</E> Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. If small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising).</E> Bids are publicly solicited and a firm fixed price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for procuring construction, if the conditions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply.</P>
                <P>(1) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following conditions should be present:</P>
                <P>(i) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available;</P>
                <P>(ii) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively for the business; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price.</P>
                <P>(2) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:</P>

                <P>(i) Bids must be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing them sufficient response time prior to the date set for opening <PRTPAGE P="280"/>the bids, for local, and tribal governments, the invitation for bids must be publicly advertised;</P>
                <P>(ii) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, must define the items or services in order for the bidder to properly respond;</P>
                <P>(iii) All bids will be opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids, for local, and tribal governments, the bids must be opened publicly;</P>
                <P>(iv) A firm fixed price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and</P>
                <P>(v) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented reason.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Procurement by competitive proposals.</E> The technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer, and either a fixed price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the following requirements apply:</P>
                <P>(1) Requests for proposals must be publicized and identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to publicized requests for proposals must be considered to the maximum extent practical;</P>
                <P>(2) Proposals must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources;</P>
                <P>(3) The non-Federal entity must have a written method for conducting technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting recipients;</P>
                <P>(4) Contracts must be awarded to the responsible firm whose proposal is most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors considered; and</P>
                <P>(5) The non-Federal entity may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.</P>
                <P>(e) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Procurement by noncompetitive proposals.</E> Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source and may be used only when one or more of the following circumstances apply:</P>
                <P>(1) The item is available only from a single source;</P>
                <P>(2) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;</P>
                <P>(3) The HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity expressly authorizes noncompetitive proposals in response to a written request from the non-Federal entity; or</P>
                <P>(4) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.</P>

                <P>(a) The non-Federal entity must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action in excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold including contract modifications. The method and degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, the non-Federal entity must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals.</P>
                <P>(b) The non-Federal entity must negotiate profit as a separate element of the price for each contract in which there is no price competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration must be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.</P>
                <P>(c) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under the Federal award are allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices would be allowable for the non-Federal entity under subpart E of this part. The non-Federal entity may reference its own cost principles that comply with the Federal cost principles.</P>

                <SUBJECT>HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity review.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The non-Federal entity must make available, upon request of the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity, technical specifications on proposed procurements where the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity believes such review is needed to ensure that the item or service specified is the one being proposed for acquisition. This review generally will take place prior to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation document. However, if the non-Federal entity desires to have the review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity may still review the specifications, with such review usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.</P>

                <P>(b) The non-Federal entity must make available upon request, for the HHS awarding agency or pass-through <PRTPAGE P="282"/>entity pre-procurement review, procurement documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, or independent cost estimates, when:</P>
                <P>(1) The non-Federal entity's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part;</P>
                <P>(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation;</P>
                <P>(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, specifies a “brand name” product;</P>
                <P>(4) The proposed contract is more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement; or</P>
                <P>(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.</P>
                <P>(c) The non-Federal entity is exempt from the pre-procurement review in paragraph (b) of this section if the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity determines that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this part.</P>
                <P>(1) The non-Federal entity may request that its procurement system be reviewed by the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity to determine whether its system meets these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, these reviews must occur where there is continuous high-dollar funding, and third party contracts are awarded on a regular basis;</P>
                <P>(2) The non-Federal entity may self-certify its procurement system. Such self-certification must not limit the HHS awarding agency's right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, the HHS awarding agency may rely on written assurances from the non-Federal entity that it is complying with these standards. The non-Federal entity must cite specific policies, procedures, regulations, or standards as being in compliance with these requirements and have its system available for review.</P>

If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements must be as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The “bid guarantee” must consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of the bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.</P>
                <P>(b) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “performance bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.</P>
                <P>(c) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Monitoring by the non-Federal entity.</E> The non-Federal entity is responsible for oversight of the operations of the Federal award supported activities. The non-Federal entity must monitor its activities under Federal awards to assure compliance with applicable Federal requirements and performance expectations are being achieved. Monitoring by the non-Federal entity must cover each program, function or activity. See also § 75.352.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Non-construction performance reports.</E> The HHS awarding agency must use standard, OMB-approved data elements for collection of performance information (including performance progress reports, Research Performance Progress Report, or such future collections as may be approved by OMB and listed on the OMB Web site).</P>
                <P>(1) The non-Federal entity must submit performance reports at the interval required by the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity to best inform improvements in program outcomes and productivity. Intervals must be no less frequent than annually nor more frequent than quarterly except in unusual circumstances, for example where more frequent reporting is necessary for the effective monitoring of the Federal award or could significantly affect program outcomes. Annual reports must be due 90 calendar days after the reporting period; quarterly or semiannual reports must be due 30 calendar days after the reporting period. Alternatively, the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year Federal awards. The final performance report will be due 90 calendar days after the period of performance end date. If a justified request is submitted by a non-Federal entity, the HHS awarding agency may extend the due date for any performance report.</P>
                <P>(2) The non-Federal entity must submit performance reports using OMB-approved government-wide standard information collections when providing performance information. As appropriate in accordance with the above-mentioned information collections, these reports will contain, for each Federal award, brief information on the following unless other collections are approved by OMB:</P>
                <P>(i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives of the Federal award established for the period. Where the accomplishments of the Federal award can be quantified, a computation of the cost (for example, related to units of accomplishment) may be required if that information will be useful. Where performance trend data and analysis would be informative to the HHS awarding agency program, the HHS awarding agency should include this as a performance reporting requirement.</P>
                <P>(ii) The reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.</P>
                <P>(iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Construction performance reports.</E> For the most part, onsite technical inspections and certified percentage of completion data are relied on heavily by HHS awarding agencies and pass-through entities to monitor progress under Federal awards and subawards for construction. The HHS awarding agency may require additional performance reports only when considered necessary.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Significant developments.</E> Events may occur between the scheduled performance reporting dates that have significant impact upon the supported activity. In such cases, the non-Federal <PRTPAGE P="284"/>entity must inform the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity as soon as the following types of conditions become known:</P>
                <P>(1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially impair the ability to meet the objective of the Federal award. This disclosure must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.</P>
                <P>(2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more or different beneficial results than originally planned.</P>
                <P>(e) The HHS awarding agency may make site visits as warranted by program needs.</P>

                <P>The non-Federal entity may concurrently receive Federal awards as a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor, depending on the substance of its agreements with HHS awarding agencies and pass-through entities. Therefore, a pass-through entity must make case-by-case determinations whether each agreement it makes for the disbursement of Federal program funds casts the party receiving the funds in the role of a subrecipient or a contractor. The HHS awarding agency may supply and require recipients to comply with additional guidance to support these determinations provided such guidance does not conflict with this section.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Subrecipients.</E> A subaward is for the purpose of carrying out a portion of a Federal award and creates a Federal assistance relationship with the subrecipient. See § 75.2 <E T="03">Subaward.</E> Characteristics which support the classification of the non-Federal entity as a subrecipient include when the non-Federal entity:</P>
                <P>(1) Determines who is eligible to receive what Federal assistance;</P>
                <P>(2) Has its performance measured in relation to whether objectives of a Federal program were met;</P>
                <P>(3) Has responsibility for programmatic decision making;</P>
                <P>(4) Is responsible for adherence to applicable Federal program requirements specified in the Federal award; and</P>
                <P>(5) In accordance with its agreement, uses the Federal funds to carry out a program for a public purpose specified in authorizing statute, as opposed to providing goods or services for the benefit of the pass-through entity.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Contractors.</E> A contract is for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for the non-Federal entity's own use and creates a procurement relationship with the contractor. See § 75.2 <E T="03">Contract.</E> Characteristics indicative of a procurement relationship between the non-Federal entity and a contractor are when the contractor:</P>
                <P>(1) Provides the goods and services within normal business operations;</P>

                <P>(d) Monitor the activities of the subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subaward is used for authorized purposes, in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward; and that subaward performance goals are achieved.

                <P>(1) Reviewing financial and performance reports required by the pass-through entity.</P>
                <P>(2) Following-up and ensuring that the subrecipient takes timely and appropriate action on all deficiencies pertaining to the Federal award provided to the subrecipient from the pass-through entity detected through audits, on-site reviews, and other means.</P>

                <P>(g) Consider whether the results of the subrecipient's audits, on-site reviews, or other monitoring indicate conditions that necessitate adjustments to the pass-through entity's own records.</P>
                <P>(h) Consider taking enforcement action against noncompliant subrecipients as described in § 75.371 and in program regulations.</P>

                <P>Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other non-Federal entity records pertinent to a Federal award must be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for Federal awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, respectively, as reported to the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient. HHS awarding agencies and pass-through entities must not impose any other record retention requirements upon non-Federal entities. The only exceptions are the following:</P>

                <P>(a) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the <PRTPAGE P="287"/>3-year period, the records must be retained until all litigation, claims, or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.</P>
                <P>(b) When the non-Federal entity is notified in writing by the HHS awarding agency, cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, cognizant agency for indirect costs, or pass-through entity to extend the retention period.</P>
                <P>(c) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds must be retained for 3 years after final disposition.</P>
                <P>(d) When records are transferred to or maintained by the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(e) Records for program income transactions after the period of performance. In some cases, recipients must report program income after the period of performance. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the records pertaining to the earning of the program income starts from the end of the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in which the program income is earned.</P>
                <P>(f) Indirect cost rate proposals and cost allocations plans. This paragraph applies to the following types of documents and their supporting records: Indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">If submitted for negotiation.</E> If the proposal, plan, or other computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the pass-through entity) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of such submission.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">If not submitted for negotiation.</E> If the proposal, plan, or other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the pass-through entity) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or computation and its supporting records starts from the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.</P>

The right also includes timely and reasonable access to the non-Federal entity's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents.</P>

                <P>(b) Only under extraordinary and rare circumstances would such access include review of the true name of victims of a crime. Routine monitoring cannot be considered extraordinary and rare circumstances that would necessitate access to this information. When access to the true name of victims of a <PRTPAGE P="288"/>crime is necessary, appropriate steps to protect this sensitive information must be taken by both the non-Federal entity and the HHS awarding agency. Any such access, other than under a court order or subpoena pursuant to a bona fide confidential investigation, must be approved by the head of the HHS awarding agency or delegate.</P>

                <P>Consistent with § 75.322, HHS awarding agencies may require recipients to permit public access to manuscripts, publications, and data produced under an award. However, no HHS awarding agency may place restrictions on the non-Federal entity that limit public access to the records of the non-Federal entity pertinent to a Federal award identified in §§ 75.361 through 75.364, except for protected personally identifiable information (PII) or when the HHS awarding agency can demonstrate that such records will be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or controlled unclassified information pursuant to Executive Order 13556 if the records had belonged to the HHS awarding agency. The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) (FOIA) does not apply to those records that remain under a non-Federal entity's control except as required under § 75.322. Unless required by Federal, state, local, or tribal statute, non-Federal entities are not required to permit public access to their records identified in §§ 75.361 through 75.364. The non-Federal entity's records provided to a Federal agency generally will be subject to FOIA and applicable exemptions.</P>

If the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity determines that noncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing additional conditions, the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity may take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:</P>
                <P>(a) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the non-Federal entity or more severe enforcement action by the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Termination.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The Federal award may be terminated in whole or in part as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) By the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity, if the non-Federal entity fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the award;</P>
                <P>(2) By the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity for cause;</P>

                <P>(3) By the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity with the consent of the non-Federal entity, in which case the two parties must agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of <PRTPAGE P="289"/>partial termination, the portion to be terminated; or</P>
                <P>(4) By the non-Federal entity upon sending to the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the Federal award or subaward will not accomplish the purposes for which the Federal award was made, the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity may terminate the Federal award in its entirety.</P>
                <P>(b) When an HHS awarding agency terminates a Federal award prior to the end of the period of performance due to the non-Federal entity's material failure to comply with the Federal award terms and conditions, the HHS awarding agency must report the termination to the OMB-designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS).</P>
                <P>(1) The information required under this paragraph (b) is not to be reported to the designated integrity and performance system until after the non-Federal entity either—</P>

                <P>(ii) Has not, within 30 calendar days after being notified of the termination, informed the HHS awarding agency that it intends to appeal the HHS awarding agency's decision to terminate.</P>
                <P>(2) If an HHS awarding agency, after entering information into the designated integrity and performance system about a termination, subsequently:</P>
                <P>(i) Learns that any of the information is erroneous, the HHS awarding agency must correct the information in the system within three business days;</P>
                <P>(ii) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal awarding agencies, the HHS awarding agency is strongly encouraged to amend the information in the system to incorporate the update in a timely way;</P>
                <P>(3) HHS awarding agencies shall not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public segment of the designated integrity and performance system that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. If the non-Federal entity asserts within seven calendar days to the HHS awarding agency who posted the information, that some of the information made publicly available is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, the HHS awarding agency who posted the information must remove the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Prior to reposting the releasable information, the HHS agency must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of Information Act procedures.</P>
                <P>(c) When a Federal award is terminated or partially terminated, both the HHS awarding agency or pass-through agency and the non-Federal entity remain responsible for compliance with the requirements of §§ 75.381 through 75.390.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Policy guide.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The application of these cost principles is based on the fundamental premises that:</P>
                <P>(a) The non-Federal entity is responsible for the efficient and effective administration of the Federal award through the application of sound management practices.</P>
                <P>(b) The non-Federal entity assumes responsibility for administering Federal funds in a manner consistent with underlying agreements, program objectives, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(c) The non-Federal entity, in recognition of its own unique combination of staff, facilities, and experience, has the primary responsibility for employing whatever form of sound organization and management techniques may be necessary in order to assure proper and efficient administration of the Federal-award.</P>
                <P>(d) The application of these cost principles should require no significant changes in the internal accounting policies and practices of the non-Federal entity. However, the accounting practices of the non-Federal entity must be consistent with these cost principles and support the accumulation of costs as required by the principles, and must provide for adequate documentation to support costs charged to the Federal award.</P>

                <P>(e) In reviewing, negotiating and approving cost allocation plans or indirect cost proposals, the cognizant agency for indirect costs should generally assure that the non-Federal entity is applying these cost accounting principles on a consistent basis during their review and negotiation of indirect cost proposals. Where wide variations exist in the treatment of a given cost item by the non-Federal entity, the reasonableness and equity of such treatments should be fully considered. See § 75.2 <E T="03">Indirect (facilities &amp; administrative (F&amp;A)) costs.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(f) For non-Federal entities that educate and engage students in research, the dual role of students as both trainees and employees (including pre- and post-doctoral staff) contributing to the completion of Federal awards for research must be recognized in the application of these principles.</P>
                <P>(g) The non-Federal entity may not earn or keep any profit resulting from Federal financial assistance, unless explicitly authorized by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See also § 75.307.</P>

              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 75.401</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Application.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> These principles must be used in determining the allowable costs of work performed by the non-Federal entity under Federal awards. These principles also must be used by the non-Federal entity as a guide in the pricing of fixed-price contracts and subcontracts where costs are used in determining the appropriate price. The principles do not apply to:</P>
                <P>(1) Arrangements under which Federal financing is in the form of loans, scholarships, fellowships, traineeships, or other fixed amounts based on such items as education allowance or published tuition rates and fees.</P>
                <P>(2) For IHEs, capitation awards, which are awards based on case counts or number of beneficiaries according to the terms and conditions of the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(3) Fixed amount awards. See also §§ 75.2 <E T="03">Fixed amount awards</E> and 75.201.</P>
                <P>(4) Federal awards to hospitals (see appendix IX to part 75).</P>
                <P>(5) Other awards under which the non-Federal entity is not required to account to the Federal Government for actual costs incurred.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal Contract.</E> Where a Federal contract awarded to a non-Federal entity is subject to the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), it incorporates the applicable CAS clauses, Standards, and CAS administration requirements per the 48 CFR Chapter 99 and 48 CFR part 30 (FAR part 30). CAS applies directly to the CAS-covered contract and the Cost Accounting Standards at 48 CFR parts 9904 or 9905 takes precedence over the cost principles in this subpart E with respect to the allocation of costs. When a contract with a non-Federal <PRTPAGE P="293"/>entity is subject to full CAS coverage, the allowability of certain costs under the cost principles will be affected by the allocation provisions of the Cost Accounting Standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> CAS 414-48 CFR 9904.414, and CAS 417-48 CFR 9904.417), apply rather the allowability provisions of § 75.449. In complying with those requirements, the non-Federal entity's application of cost accounting practices for estimating, accumulating, and reporting costs for other Federal awards and other cost objectives under the CAS-covered contract still must be consistent with its cost accounting practices for the CAS-covered contracts. In all cases, only one set of accounting records needs to be maintained for the allocation of costs by the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> Some nonprofit organizations, because of their size and nature of operations, can be considered to be similar to for-profit entities for purpose of applicability of cost principles. Such nonprofit organizations must operate under Federal cost principles applicable to for-profit entities located at 48 CFR 31.2. A listing of these organizations is contained in appendix VIII to part 75. Other organizations, as approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs, may be added from time to time.</P>

                <P>(a) Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the Federal award and be allocable thereto under these principles.</P>
                <P>(b) Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these principles or in the Federal award as to types or amount of cost items.</P>
                <P>(c) Be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally-financed and other activities of the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(d) Be accorded consistent treatment. A cost may not be assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to the Federal award as an indirect cost.</P>
                <P>(e) Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except, for state and local governments and Indian tribes only, as otherwise provided for in this part.</P>
                <P>(f) Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements of any other federally-financed program in either the current or a prior period. See also § 75.306(b).</P>
                <P>(g) Be adequately documented. See also §§ 75.300 through 75.309.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Reasonable costs.</SUBJECT>
                <P>A cost is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to incur the cost. The question of reasonableness is particularly important when the non-Federal entity is predominantly federally-funded. In determining reasonableness of a given cost, consideration must be given to:</P>
                <P>(a) Whether the cost is of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the operation of the non-Federal entity or the proper and efficient performance of the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(b) The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as: Sound business practices; arm's-length bargaining; Federal, state, local, tribal, and other laws and regulations; and terms and conditions of the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(c) Market prices for comparable goods or services for the geographic area.</P>

                <P>(d) Whether the individuals concerned acted with prudence in the circumstances considering their responsibilities to the non-Federal entity, its employees, where applicable its students or membership, the public at large, and the Federal Government.<PRTPAGE P="294"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) Whether the non-Federal entity significantly deviates from its established practices and policies regarding the incurrence of costs, which may unjustifiably increase the Federal award's cost.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 75.405</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Allocable costs.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A cost is allocable to a particular Federal award or other cost objective if the goods or services involved are chargeable or assignable to that Federal award or cost objective in accordance with relative benefits received. This standard is met if the cost:</P>
                <P>(1) Is incurred specifically for the Federal award;</P>
                <P>(2) Benefits both the Federal award and other work of the non-Federal entity and can be distributed in proportions that may be approximated using reasonable methods; and</P>
                <P>(3) Is necessary to the overall operation of the non-Federal entity and is assignable in part to the Federal award in accordance with the principles in this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) All activities which benefit from the non-Federal entity's indirect (F&amp;A) cost, including unallowable activities and donated services by the non-Federal entity or third parties, will receive an appropriate allocation of indirect costs.</P>
                <P>(c) Any cost allocable to a particular Federal award under the principles provided for in this part may not be charged to other Federal awards to overcome fund deficiencies, to avoid restrictions imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal awards, or for other reasons. However, this prohibition would not preclude the non-Federal entity from shifting costs that are allowable under two or more Federal awards in accordance with existing Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awards.</P>
                <P>(d) Direct cost allocation principles. If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the projects based on the proportional benefit. If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that cannot be determined because of the interrelationship of the work involved, then, notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, the costs may be allocated or transferred to benefitted projects on any reasonable documented basis. Where the purchase of equipment or other capital asset is specifically authorized under a Federal award, the costs are assignable to the Federal award regardless of the use that may be made of the equipment or other capital asset involved when no longer needed for the purpose for which it was originally required. See also §§ 75.317 through 75.323 and 75.439.</P>
                <P>(e) If the contract is subject to CAS, costs must be allocated to the contract pursuant to the Cost Accounting Standards. To the extent that CAS is applicable, the allocation of costs in accordance with CAS takes precedence over the allocation provisions in this part.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Applicable credits.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Applicable credits refer to those receipts or reduction-of-expenditure-type transactions that offset or reduce expense items allocable to the Federal award as direct or indirect (F&amp;A) costs. Examples of such transactions are: Purchase discounts, rebates or allowances, recoveries or indemnities on losses, insurance refunds or rebates, and adjustments of overpayments or erroneous charges. To the extent that such credits accruing to or received by the non-Federal entity relate to allowable costs, they must be credited to the Federal award either as a cost reduction or cash refund, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) In some instances, the amounts received from the Federal Government to finance activities or service operations of the non-Federal entity should be treated as applicable credits. Specifically, the concept of netting such credit items (including any amounts used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements) must be recognized in determining the rates or amounts to be charged to the Federal award. (See §§ 75.436 and 75.468, for areas of potential application in the matter of Federal financing of activities.)</P>

                <P>(a) Under any given Federal award, the reasonableness and allocability of <PRTPAGE P="295"/>certain items of costs may be difficult to determine. In order to avoid subsequent disallowance or dispute based on unreasonableness or non-allocability, the non-Federal entity may seek the prior written approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs or the HHS awarding agency in advance of the incurrence of special or unusual costs. Prior written approval should include the timeframe or scope of the agreement. The absence of prior written approval on any element of cost will not, in itself, affect the reasonableness or allocability of that element, unless prior approval is specifically required for allowability as described under certain circumstances in the following sections of this part:</P>

                <P>(a) Negotiated indirect (F&amp;A) cost rates based on a proposal later found to have included costs that:</P>
                <P>(1) Are unallowable as specified by Federal statutes, regulations or the terms and conditions of a Federal award; or</P>
                <P>(2) Are unallowable because they are not allocable to the Federal award(s), must be adjusted, or a refund must be made, in accordance with the requirements of this section. These adjustments or refunds are designed to correct the proposals used to establish the rates and do not constitute a reopening of the rate negotiation. The adjustments or refunds will be made regardless of the type of rate negotiated (predetermined, final, fixed, or provisional).</P>
                <P>(b) For rates covering a future fiscal year of the non-Federal entity, the unallowable costs will be removed from the indirect (F&amp;A) cost pools and the rates appropriately adjusted.</P>
                <P>(c) For rates covering a past period, the Federal share of the unallowable costs will be computed for each year involved and a cash refund (including interest chargeable in accordance with applicable regulations) will be made to the Federal Government. If cash refunds are made for past periods covered by provisional or fixed rates, appropriate adjustments will be made when the rates are finalized to avoid duplicate recovery of the unallowable costs by the Federal Government.</P>
                <P>(d) For rates covering the current period, either a rate adjustment or a refund, as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, must be required by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The choice of method must be at the discretion of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, based on its judgment as to which method would be most practical.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Classification of costs.</SUBJECT>
                <P>There is no universal rule for classifying certain costs as either direct or indirect (F&amp;A) under every accounting system. A cost may be direct with respect to some specific service or function, but indirect with respect to the Federal award or other final cost objective. Therefore, it is essential that each item of cost incurred for the same purpose be treated consistently in like circumstances either as a direct or an indirect (F&amp;A) cost in order to avoid possible double-charging of Federal awards. Guidelines for determining direct and indirect (F&amp;A) costs charged to Federal awards are provided in this subpart.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 75.413</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Direct costs.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Direct costs are those costs that can be identified specifically with a particular final cost objective, such as a Federal award, or other internally or externally funded activity, or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy. Costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances must be treated consistently as either direct or indirect (F&amp;A) costs. See also § 75.405.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Application to Federal awards.</E> Identification with the Federal award rather than the nature of the goods and services involved is the determining factor in distinguishing direct from indirect (F&amp;A) costs of Federal awards. Typical costs charged directly to a Federal award are the compensation of employees who work on that award, their related fringe benefit costs, the <PRTPAGE P="297"/>costs of materials and other items of expense incurred for the Federal award. If directly related to a specific award, certain costs that otherwise would be treated as indirect costs may also include extraordinary utility consumption, the cost of materials supplied from stock or services rendered by specialized facilities or other institutional service operations.</P>
                <P>(c) The salaries of administrative and clerical staff should normally be treated as indirect (F&amp;A) costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate only if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(1) Administrative or clerical services are integral to a project or activity;</P>
                <P>(2) Individuals involved can be specifically identified with the project or activity;</P>
                <P>(3) Such costs are explicitly included in the budget or have the prior written approval of the Federal awarding agency; and</P>
                <P>(4) The costs are not also recovered as indirect costs.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Minor items.</E> Any direct cost of minor amount may be treated as an indirect (F&amp;A) cost for reasons of practicality where such accounting treatment for that item of cost is consistently applied to all Federal and non-Federal cost objectives.</P>
                <P>(e) The costs of certain activities are not allowable as charges to Federal awards. However, even though these costs are unallowable for purposes of computing charges to Federal awards, they nonetheless must be treated as direct costs for purposes of determining indirect (F&amp;A) cost rates and be allocated their equitable share of the non-Federal entity's indirect costs if they represent activities which:</P>
                <P>(1) Include the salaries of personnel,</P>
                <P>(2) Occupy space, and</P>
                <P>(3) Benefit from the non-Federal entity's indirect (F&amp;A) costs.</P>
                <P>(f) For nonprofit organizations, the costs of activities performed by the non-Federal entity primarily as a service to members, clients, or the general public when significant and necessary to the non-Federal entity's mission must be treated as direct costs whether or not allowable, and be allocated an equitable share of indirect (F&amp;A) costs. Some examples of these types of activities include:</P>
                <P>(1) Maintenance of membership rolls, subscriptions, publications, and related functions. See also § 75.454.</P>
                <P>(2) Providing services and information to members, legislative or administrative bodies, or the public. See also §§ 75.454 and 75.450.</P>
                <P>(3) Promotion, lobbying, and other forms of public relations. See also §§ 75.421 and 75.450.</P>
                <P>(4) Conferences except those held to conduct the general administration of the non-Federal entity. See also § 75.432.</P>
                <P>(5) Maintenance, protection, and investment of special funds not used in operation of the non-Federal entity. See also § 75.442.</P>
                <P>(6) Administration of group benefits on behalf of members or clients, including life and hospital insurance, annuity or retirement plans, and financial aid. See also § 75.431.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Indirect (F&amp;A) costs.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Facilities and Administration Classification.</E> For major IHEs and major nonprofit organizations, indirect (F&amp;A) costs must be classified within two broad categories: “Facilities” and “Administration.” “Facilities” is defined as depreciation on buildings, equipment and capital improvement, interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, and operations and maintenance expenses. “Administration” is defined as general administration and general expenses such as the director's office, accounting, personnel and all other types of expenditures not listed specifically under one of the subcategories of “Facilities” (including cross allocations from other pools, where applicable). For nonprofit organizations, library expenses are included in the “Administration” category; for institutions of higher education, they are included in the “Facilities” category. Major IHEs are defined as those required to use the Standard Format for Submission as noted in appendix III to part 75.C. 11. Major nonprofit organizations are those which receive more than $10 million dollars in direct Federal funding.<PRTPAGE P="298"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Diversity of nonprofit organizations.</E> Because of the diverse characteristics and accounting practices of nonprofit organizations, it is not possible to specify the types of cost which may be classified as indirect (F&amp;A) cost in all situations. Identification with a Federal award rather than the nature of the goods and services involved is the determining factor in distinguishing direct from indirect (F&amp;A) costs of Federal awards. However, typical examples of indirect (F&amp;A) cost for many nonprofit organizations may include depreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining facilities, and general administration and general expenses, such as the salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel administration, and accounting.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal Agency Acceptance of Negotiated Indirect Cost Rates.</E> (See also § 75.306.)</P>
                <P>(1) The negotiated rates must be accepted by all Federal awarding agencies. An HHS awarding agency may use a rate different from the negotiated rate for a class of Federal awards or a single Federal award only when required by Federal statute or regulation, or when approved by a Federal awarding agency head or delegate based on documented justification as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) Indirect costs on training grants are limited to a fixed rate of eight percent of MTDC exclusive of tuition and related fees, direct expenditures for equipment, and subawards in excess of $25,000;</P>
                <P>(ii) Indirect costs on grants awarded to foreign organizations and foreign public entities and performed fully outside of the territorial limits of the U.S. may be paid to support the costs of compliance with federal requirements at a fixed rate of eight percent of MTDC exclusive of tuition and related fees, direct expenditures for equipment, and subawards in excess of $25,000; and,</P>
                <P>(iii) Negotiated indirect costs may be paid to the American University, Beirut, and the World Health Organization.</P>
                <P>(2) The HHS awarding agency head or delegate must notify OMB of any approved deviations.</P>
                <P>(3) The HHS awarding agency must implement, and make publicly available, the policies, procedures and general decision making criteria that their programs will follow to seek and justify deviations from negotiated rates.</P>
                <P>(4) As required under § 75.203(c), the HHS awarding agency must include in the notice of funding opportunity the policies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement, matching, or cost share as approved. See also appendix I.C.2 and D.6 of this part. As appropriate, the HHS agency should incorporate discussion of these policies into their outreach activities with non-Federal entities prior to the posting of a notice of funding opportunity.</P>
                <P>(d) Pass-through entities are subject to the requirements in § 75.352(a)(4).</P>
                <P>(e) Requirements for development and submission of indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans are contained in appendices III-VII, and appendix IX as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Appendix III to Part 75—Indirect (F&amp;A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs);</P>
                <P>(2) Appendix IV to Part 75—Indirect (F&amp;A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations;</P>
                <P>(3) Appendix V to Part 75—State/Local Governmentwide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans;</P>
                <P>(4) Appendix VI to Part 75—Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans;</P>
                <P>(5) Appendix VII to Part 75—States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals; and</P>
                <P>(6) Appendix IX to Part 75—Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.</P>

                <P>(f) In addition to the procedures outlined in the appendices in paragraph (e) of this section, any non-Federal entity that has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, except for those non-Federal entities described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) and section (D)(1)(b) of appendix VII to this part, may elect to charge a de minimis rate <PRTPAGE P="299"/>of 10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC) which may be used indefinitely. As described in § 75.403, costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or direct costs, but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. If chosen, this methodology once elected must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time as a non-Federal entity chooses to negotiate for a rate, which the non-Federal entity may apply to do at any time.</P>
                <P>(g) Any non-Federal entity that has a current federally negotiated indirect cost rate may apply for a one-time extension of the rates in that agreement for a period of up to four years. This extension will be subject to the review and approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs. If an extension is granted the non-Federal entity may not request a rate review until the extension period ends. At the end of the 4-year extension, the non-Federal entity must re-apply to negotiate a rate. Subsequent one-time extensions (up to four years) are permitted if a renegotiation is completed between each extension request.</P>

                <P>(a) To assure that expenditures are proper and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award and approved project budgets, the annual and final fiscal reports or vouchers requesting payment under the agreements must include a certification, signed by an official who is authorized to legally bind the non-Federal entity, which reads as follows: “By signing this report, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the report is true, complete, and accurate, and the expenditures, disbursements and cash receipts are for the purposes and objectives set forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise. (U.S. Code Title 18, Section 1001 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3730 and 3801-3812).”</P>
                <P>(b) Certification of cost allocation plan or indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate proposal. Each cost allocation plan or indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate proposal must comply with the following:</P>
                <P>(1) A proposal to establish a cost allocation plan or an indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate, whether submitted to a Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs or maintained on file by the non-Federal entity, must be certified by the non-Federal entity using the Certificate of Cost Allocation Plan or Certificate of Indirect Costs as set forth in appendices III through VII, and appendix IX. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the non-Federal entity by an individual at a level no lower than vice president or chief financial officer of the non-Federal entity that submits the proposal.</P>
                <P>(2) Unless the non-Federal entity has elected the option under § 75.414(f), the Federal Government may either disallow all indirect (F&amp;A) costs or unilaterally establish such a plan or rate when the non-Federal entity fails to submit a certified proposal for establishing such a plan or rate in accordance with the requirements. Such a plan or rate may be based upon audited historical data or such other data that have been furnished to the cognizant agency for indirect costs and for which it can be demonstrated that all unallowable costs have been excluded. When a cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate is unilaterally established by the Federal Government because the non-Federal entity failed to submit a certified proposal, the plan or rate established will be set to ensure that potentially unallowable costs will not be reimbursed.</P>
                <P>(c) Certifications by non-profit organizations as appropriate that they did not meet the definition of a major non-profit organization as defined in § 75.414(a).</P>

                <P>(a) For states, local governments and Indian tribes, certain services, such as motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, accounting, etc., are provided to operating agencies on a centralized basis.

The central service cost allocation plan provides that process.</P>
                <P>(b) Individual operating agencies (governmental department or agency), normally charge Federal awards for indirect costs through an indirect cost rate. A separate indirect cost rate(s) proposal for each operating agency is usually necessary to claim indirect costs under Federal-awards. Indirect costs include:</P>
                <P>(1) The indirect costs originating in each department or agency of the governmental unit carrying out Federal awards; and</P>
                <P>(2) The costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost allocation plan and not otherwise treated as direct costs.</P>

CAS-covered contracts awarded to the IHEs are subject to the CAS requirements at 48 CFR parts 9900 through 9999 and 48 CFR part 30 (FAR part 30).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclosure statement.</E> An IHE that receives aggregate Federal awards totaling $50 million or more subject to this part during its most recently completed fiscal year must disclose their cost accounting practices by filing a Disclosure Statement (DS-2), which is reproduced in appendix III to part 75. With the approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, an IHE may meet the DS-2 submission by submitting the DS-2 for each business unit that received $50 million or more in Federal awards.</P>

                <P>(2) An IHE is responsible for maintaining an accurate DS-2 and complying with disclosed cost accounting practices. An IHE must file amendments to the DS-2 to the cognizant agency for indirect costs six months in advance of a disclosed practice being changed to comply with a new or modified standard, or when a practice is changed for other reasons. An IHE may proceed with implementing the change only if it has not been notified by the Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs that either a longer period will be needed for review or there are concerns with the potential change within the six months period. Amendments of a DS-2 may be submitted at any time. Resubmission of a complete, updated DS-2 is discouraged except when there are extensive changes to disclosed practices.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Cost and funding adjustments.</E> Cost adjustments must be made by the cognizant agency for indirect costs if an IHE fails to comply with the cost policies in this part or fails to consistently follow its established or disclosed cost accounting practices when estimating, accumulating or reporting the costs of Federal awards, and the aggregate cost impact on Federal awards is material. The cost adjustment must normally be made on an aggregate basis for all affected Federal awards through an adjustment of the IHE's future F&amp;A costs rates or other means considered appropriate by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. Under the terms of CAS covered contracts, adjustments in the amount of funding provided may also be required when the estimated proposal costs were not determined in accordance with established cost accounting practices.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Overpayments.</E> Excess amounts paid in the aggregate by the Federal Government under Federal awards due to a noncompliant cost accounting practice used to estimate, accumulate, or report costs must be credited or refunded, as deemed appropriate by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. Interest applicable to the excess amounts paid in the aggregate during the period of noncompliance must also be determined and collected in accordance with applicable HHS agency regulations.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Compliant cost accounting practice changes.</E> Changes from one compliant cost accounting practice to another compliant practice that are approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs may require cost adjustments if the change has a material effect on Federal awards and the changes are deemed appropriate by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Responsibilities.</E> The cognizant agency for indirect cost must:</P>
                <P>(i) Determine cost adjustments for all Federal awards in the aggregate on behalf of the Federal Government. Actions of the cognizant agency for indirect cost in making cost adjustment determinations must be coordinated with all affected HHS awarding agencies to the extent necessary.</P>
                <P>(ii) Prescribe guidelines and establish internal procedures to promptly determine on behalf of the Federal Government that a DS-2 adequately discloses the IHE's cost accounting practices and that the disclosed practices are compliant with applicable CAS and the requirements of this part.</P>
                <P>(iii) Distribute to all affected Federal awarding agencies any DS-2 determination of adequacy or noncompliance.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Considerations for selected items of cost.</SUBJECT>

                <P>This section provides principles to be applied in establishing the allowability of certain items involved in determining cost, in addition to the requirements of §§ 75.402 through 75.411. These principles apply whether or not a particular item of cost is properly treated as direct cost or indirect (F&amp;A) cost. Failure to mention a particular item of cost is not intended to imply that it is either allowable or unallowable; rather, determination as to allowability in each case should be based on the treatment provided for similar or related items of cost, and based on the principles described in §§ 75.402 through 75.411. In case of a discrepancy between the provisions of a specific Federal award and the provisions below, the <PRTPAGE P="302"/>Federal award governs. Criteria outlined in § 75.403 must be applied in determining allowability. See also § 75.102.</P>

                <P>(2) Costs of communicating with the public and press pertaining to specific activities or accomplishments which result from performance of the Federal award (these costs are considered necessary as part of the outreach effort for the Federal award); or</P>
                <P>(3) Costs of conducting general liaison with news media and government public relations officers, to the extent that such activities are limited to communication and liaison necessary to keep the public informed on matters of public concern, such as notices of funding opportunities, financial matters, etc.</P>

                <P>(a) A reasonably proportionate share of the costs of audits required by, and performed in accordance with, the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507), as implemented by requirements of this part, are allowable. However, the following audit costs are unallowable:</P>

                <P>(1) Any costs when audits required by the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part—have not been conducted or <PRTPAGE P="303"/>have been conducted but not in accordance therewith; and</P>
                <P>(2) Any costs of auditing a non-Federal entity that is exempted from having an audit conducted under the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part because its expenditures under Federal awards are less than $750,000 during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year.</P>
                <P>(b) The costs of a financial statement audit of a non-Federal entity that does not currently have a Federal award may be included in the indirect cost pool for a cost allocation plan or indirect cost proposal.</P>
                <P>(c) Pass-through entities may charge Federal awards for the cost of agreed-upon-procedures engagements to monitor subrecipients (in accordance with subpart D of this part, §§ 75.351 through 75.353) which are exempted from the requirements of the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part. This cost is allowable only if the agreed-upon-procedures engagements are:</P>
                <P>(1) Conducted in accordance with GAGAS attestation standards;</P>
                <P>(2) Paid for and arranged by the pass-through entity; and</P>

                <P>Bad debts (debts which have been determined to be uncollectable), including losses (whether actual or estimated) arising from uncollectable accounts and other claims, are unallowable. Related collection costs, and related legal costs, arising from such debts after they have been determined to be uncollectable are also unallowable. See also § 75.428.</P>

They arise also in instances where the non-Federal entity requires similar assurance, including: Bonds as bid, performance, payment, advance payment, infringement, and fidelity bonds for employees and officials.</P>
                <P>(b) Costs of bonding required pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award are allowable.</P>
                <P>(c) Costs of bonding required by the non-Federal entity in the general conduct of its operations are allowable as an indirect cost to the extent that such bonding is in accordance with sound business practice and the rates and premiums are reasonable under the circumstances.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 75.430</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Compensation—personal services.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Compensation for personal services includes all remuneration, paid currently or accrued, for services of employees rendered during the period of performance under the Federal award, including but not necessarily limited to wages and salaries. Compensation for personal services may also include fringe benefits which are addressed in § 75.431. Costs of compensation are allowable to the extent that they satisfy the specific requirements of this part, and that the total compensation for individual employees:</P>
                <P>(1) Is reasonable for the services rendered and conforms to the established written policy of the non-Federal entity consistently applied to both Federal and non-Federal activities;</P>

                <P>(2) Follows an appointment made in accordance with a non-Federal entity's laws and/or rules or written policies <PRTPAGE P="304"/>and meets the requirements of Federal statute, where applicable; and</P>
                <P>(3) Is determined and supported as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, when applicable.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Reasonableness.</E> Compensation for employees engaged in work on Federal awards will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is consistent with that paid for similar work in other activities of the non-Federal entity. In cases where the kinds of employees required for Federal awards are not found in the other activities of the non-Federal entity, compensation will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is comparable to that paid for similar work in the labor market in which the non-Federal entity competes for the kind of employees involved.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Professional activities outside the non-Federal entity.</E> Unless an arrangement is specifically authorized by an HHS awarding agency, a non-Federal entity must follow its written non-Federal entity-wide policies and practices concerning the permissible extent of professional services that can be provided outside the non-Federal entity for non-organizational compensation. Where such non-Federal entity-wide written policies do not exist or do not adequately define the permissible extent of consulting or other non-organizational activities undertaken for extra outside pay, the Federal Government may require that the effort of professional staff working on Federal awards be allocated between:</P>
                <P>(1) Non-Federal entity activities, and</P>
                <P>(2) Non-organizational professional activities. If the HHS awarding agency considers the extent of non-organizational professional effort excessive or inconsistent with the conflicts-of-interest terms and conditions of the Federal award, appropriate arrangements governing compensation will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Unallowable costs.</E> (1) Costs which are unallowable under other sections of these principles must not be allowable under this section solely on the basis that they constitute personnel compensation.</P>
                <P>(2) The allowable compensation for certain employees is subject to a ceiling in accordance with statute. For the amount of the ceiling for cost-reimbursement contracts, the covered compensation subject to the ceiling, the covered employees, and other relevant provisions, see 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1)(P), and 41 U.S.C. 1127 and 4304(a)(16). For other types of Federal awards, other statutory ceilings may apply.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Special considerations.</E> Special considerations in determining allowability of compensation will be given to any change in a non-Federal entity's compensation policy resulting in a substantial increase in its employees' level of compensation (particularly when the change was concurrent with an increase in the ratio of Federal awards to other activities) or any change in the treatment of allowability of specific types of compensation due to changes in Federal policy.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Incentive compensation.</E> Incentive compensation to employees based on cost reduction, or efficient performance, suggestion awards, safety awards, etc., is allowable to the extent that the overall compensation is determined to be reasonable and such costs are paid or accrued pursuant to an agreement entered into in good faith between the non-Federal entity and the employees before the services were rendered, or pursuant to an established plan followed by the non-Federal entity so consistently as to imply, in effect, an agreement to make such payment.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Nonprofit organizations.</E> For compensation to members of nonprofit organizations, trustees, directors, associates, officers, or the immediate families thereof, determination must be made that such compensation is reasonable for the actual personal services rendered rather than a distribution of earnings in excess of costs. This may include director's and executive committee member's fees, incentive awards, allowances for off-site pay, incentive pay, location allowances, hardship pay, and cost-of-living differentials.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Institutions of higher education (IHEs).</E> (1) Certain conditions require special consideration and possible limitations in determining allowable personnel compensation costs under Federal awards. Among such conditions are the following:</P>

                <P>(i) Allowable activities. Charges to Federal awards may include reasonable <PRTPAGE P="305"/>amounts for activities contributing and directly related to work under an agreement, such as delivering special lectures about specific aspects of the ongoing activity, writing reports and articles, developing and maintaining protocols (human, animals, etc.), managing substances/chemicals, managing and securing project-specific data, coordinating research subjects, participating in appropriate seminars, consulting with colleagues and graduate students, and attending meetings and conferences.</P>
                <P>(ii) Incidental activities. Incidental activities for which supplemental compensation is allowable under written institutional policy (at a rate not to exceed institutional base salary) need not be included in the records described in paragraph (i) of this section to directly charge payments of incidental activities, such activities must either be specifically provided for in the Federal award budget or receive prior written approval by the HHS awarding agency.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Salary basis.</E> Charges for work performed on Federal awards by faculty members during the academic year are allowable at the IBS rate. Except as noted in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, in no event will charges to Federal awards, irrespective of the basis of computation, exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for that period. This principle applies to all members of faculty at an institution. IBS is defined as the annual compensation paid by an IHE for an individual's appointment, whether that individual's time is spent on research, instruction, administration, or other activities. IBS excludes any income that an individual earns outside of duties performed for the IHE. Unless there is prior approval by the HHS awarding agency, charges of a faculty member's salary to a Federal award must not exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for the period during which the faculty member worked on the award.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Intra-Institution of Higher Education (IHE) consulting.</E> Intra-IHE consulting by faculty is assumed to be undertaken as an IHE obligation requiring no compensation in addition to IBS. However, in unusual cases where consultation is across departmental lines or involves a separate or remote operation, and the work performed by the faculty member is in addition to his or her regular responsibilities, any charges for such work representing additional compensation above IBS are allowable provided that such consulting arrangements are specifically provided for in the Federal award or approved in writing by the HHS awarding agency.</P>
                <P>(4) Extra Service Pay normally represents overload compensation, subject to institutional compensation policies for services above and beyond IBS. Where extra service pay is a result of Intra-IHE consulting, it is subject to the same requirements of paragraph (b) above. It is allowable if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(i) The non-Federal entity establishes consistent written policies which apply uniformly to all faculty members, not just those working on Federal awards.</P>
                <P>(ii) The non-Federal entity establishes a consistent written definition of work covered by IBS which is specific enough to determine conclusively when work beyond that level has occurred. This may be described in appointment letters or other documentations.</P>
                <P>(iii) The supplementation amount paid is commensurate with the IBS rate of pay and the amount of additional work performed. See paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iv) The salaries, as supplemented, fall within the salary structure and pay ranges established by and documented in writing or otherwise applicable to the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(v) The total salaries charged to Federal awards including extra service pay are subject to the Standards of Documentation as described in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Periods outside the academic year.</E> (i) Except as specified for teaching activity in paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section, charges for work performed by faculty members on Federal awards during periods not included in the base salary period will be at a rate not in excess of the IBS.</P>

                <P>(ii) Charges for teaching activities performed by faculty members on Federal awards during periods not included <PRTPAGE P="306"/>in IBS period will be based on the normal written policy of the IHE governing compensation to faculty members for teaching assignments during such periods.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Part-time faculty.</E> Charges for work performed on Federal awards by faculty members having only part-time appointments will be determined at a rate not in excess of that regularly paid for part-time assignments.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Sabbatical leave costs.</E> Rules for sabbatical leave are as follow:</P>
                <P>(i) Costs of leaves of absence by employees for performance of graduate work or sabbatical study, travel, or research are allowable provided the IHE has a uniform written policy on sabbatical leave for persons engaged in instruction and persons engaged in research. Such costs will be allocated on an equitable basis among all related activities of the IHE.</P>
                <P>(ii) Where sabbatical leave is included in fringe benefits for which a cost is determined for assessment as a direct charge, the aggregate amount of such assessments applicable to all work of the institution during the base period must be reasonable in relation to the IHE's actual experience under its sabbatical leave policy.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Salary rates for non-faculty members.</E> Non-faculty full-time professional personnel may also earn “extra service pay” in accordance with the non-Federal entity's written policy and consistent with paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Standards for documentation of personnel expenses.</E> (1) Charges to Federal awards for salaries and wages must be based on records that accurately reflect the work performed. These records must:</P>
                <P>(i) Be supported by a system of internal control which provides reasonable assurance that the charges are accurate, allowable, and properly allocated;</P>
                <P>(ii) Be incorporated into the official records of the non-Federal entity;</P>
                <P>(iii) Reasonably reflect the total activity for which the employee is compensated by the non-Federal entity, not exceeding 100% of compensated activities (for IHE, this per the IHE's definition of IBS);</P>
                <P>(iv) Encompass both federally assisted and all other activities compensated by the non-Federal entity on an integrated basis, but may include the use of subsidiary records as defined in the non-Federal entity's written policy;</P>
                <P>(v) Comply with the established accounting policies and practices of the non-Federal entity (See paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section for treatment of incidental work for IHEs.); and</P>
                <P>(vi) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(vii) Support the distribution of the employee's salary or wages among specific activities or cost objectives if the employee works on more than one Federal award; a Federal award and non-Federal award; an indirect cost activity and a direct cost activity; two or more indirect activities which are allocated using different allocation bases; or an unallowable activity and a direct or indirect cost activity.</P>
                <P>(viii) Budget estimates (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> estimates determined before the services are performed) alone do not qualify as support for charges to Federal awards, but may be used for interim accounting purposes, provided that:</P>
                <P>(A) The system for establishing the estimates produces reasonable approximations of the activity actually performed;</P>
                <P>(B) Significant changes in the corresponding work activity (as defined by the non-Federal entity's written policies) are identified and entered into the records in a timely manner. Short term (such as one or two months) fluctuation between workload categories need not be considered as long as the distribution of salaries and wages is reasonable over the longer term; and</P>
                <P>(C) The non-Federal entity's system of internal controls includes processes to review after-the-fact interim charges made to a Federal awards based on budget estimates. All necessary adjustment must be made such that the final amount charged to the Federal award is accurate, allowable, and properly allocated.</P>
                <P>(ix) Because practices vary as to the activity constituting a full workload (for IHEs, IBS), records may reflect categories of activities expressed as a percentage distribution of total activities.</P>

                <P>(x) It is recognized that teaching, research, service, and administration are <PRTPAGE P="307"/>often inextricably intermingled in an academic setting. When recording salaries and wages charged to Federal awards for IHEs, a precise assessment of factors that contribute to costs is therefore not always feasible, nor is it expected.</P>
                <P>(2) For records which meet the standards required in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the non-Federal entity will not be required to provide additional support or documentation for the work performed, other than that referenced in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) In accordance with Department of Labor regulations implementing the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (29 CFR part 516), charges for the salaries and wages of nonexempt employees, in addition to the supporting documentation described in this section, must also be supported by records indicating the total number of hours worked each day.</P>
                <P>(4) Salaries and wages of employees used in meeting cost sharing or matching requirements on Federal awards must be supported in the same manner as salaries and wages claimed for reimbursement from Federal awards.</P>
                <P>(5) For states, local governments and Indian tribes, substitute processes or systems for allocating salaries and wages to Federal awards may be used in place of or in addition to the records described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section if approved by the cognizant agency for indirect cost. Such systems may include, but are not limited to, random moment sampling, “rolling” time studies, case counts, or other quantifiable measures of work performed.</P>
                <P>(i) Substitute systems which use sampling methods (primarily for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and other public assistance programs) must meet acceptable statistical sampling standards including:</P>
                <P>(A) The sampling universe must include all of the employees whose salaries and wages are to be allocated based on sample results except as provided in paragraph (i)(5)(iii) of this section;</P>
                <P>(B) The entire time period involved must be covered by the sample; and</P>
                <P>(C) The results must be statistically valid and applied to the period being sampled.</P>
                <P>(ii) Allocating charges for the sampled employees' supervisors, clerical and support staffs, based on the results of the sampled employees, will be acceptable.</P>
                <P>(iii) Less than full compliance with the statistical sampling standards noted in paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section may be accepted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs if it concludes that the amounts to be allocated to Federal awards will be minimal, or if it concludes that the system proposed by the non-Federal entity will result in lower costs to Federal awards than a system which complies with the standards.</P>
                <P>(6) Cognizant agencies for indirect costs are encouraged to approve alternative proposals based on outcomes and milestones for program performance where these are clearly documented. Where approved by the Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs, these plans are acceptable as an alternative to the requirements of paragraph (i)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(7) For Federal awards of similar purpose activity or instances of approved blended funding, a non-Federal entity may submit performance plans that incorporate funds from multiple Federal awards and account for their combined use based on performance-oriented metrics, provided that such plans are approved in advance by all involved HHS awarding agencies. In these instances, the non-Federal entity must submit a request for waiver of the requirements based on documentation that describes the method of charging costs, relates the charging of costs to the specific activity that is applicable to all fund sources, and is based on quantifiable measures of the activity in relation to time charged.</P>
                <P>(8) For a non-Federal entity where the records do not meet the standards described in this section, the Federal Government may require personnel activity reports, including prescribed certifications, or equivalent documentation that support the records as required in this section.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Compensation—fringe benefits.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Fringe benefits are allowances and services provided by employers to their employees as compensation in addition to regular salaries and wages. Fringe benefits include, but are not limited to, the costs of leave (vacation, family-related, sick or military), employee insurance, pensions, and unemployment benefit plans. Except as provided elsewhere in these principles, the costs of fringe benefits are allowable provided that the benefits are reasonable and are required by law, non-Federal entity-employee agreement, or an established policy of the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Leave.</E> The cost of fringe benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to employees during periods of authorized absences from the job, such as for annual leave, family-related leave, sick leave, holidays, court leave, military leave, administrative leave, and other similar benefits, are allowable if all of the following criteria are met:</P>
                <P>(1) They are provided under established written leave policies;</P>
                <P>(2) The costs are equitably allocated to all related activities, including Federal awards; and,</P>
                <P>(3) The accounting basis (cash or accrual) selected for costing each type of leave is consistently followed by the non-Federal entity or specified grouping of employees.</P>
                <P>(i) When a non-Federal entity uses the cash basis of accounting, the cost of leave is recognized in the period that the leave is taken and paid for. Payments for unused leave when an employee retires or terminates employment are allowable in the year of payment.</P>
                <P>(ii) The accrual basis may be only used for those types of leave for which a liability as defined by GAAP exists when the leave is earned. When a non-Federal entity uses the accrual basis of accounting, allowable leave costs are the lesser of the amount accrued or funded.</P>
                <P>(c) The cost of fringe benefits in the form of employer contributions or expenses for social security; employee life, health, unemployment, and worker's compensation insurance (except as indicated in § 75.447); pension plan costs (see paragraph (i) of this section); and other similar benefits are allowable, provided such benefits are granted under established written policies. Such benefits, must be allocated to Federal awards and all other activities in a manner consistent with the pattern of benefits attributable to the individuals or group(s) of employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such Federal awards and other activities, and charged as direct or indirect costs in accordance with the non-Federal entity's accounting practices.</P>
                <P>(d) Fringe benefits may be assigned to cost objectives by identifying specific benefits to specific individual employees or by allocating on the basis of entity-wide salaries and wages of the employees receiving the benefits. When the allocation method is used, separate allocations must be made to selective groupings of employees, unless the non-Federal entity demonstrates that costs in relationship to salaries and wages do not differ significantly for different groups of employees.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Insurance.</E> See also § 75.447(d)(1) and (2).</P>
                <P>(1) Provisions for a reserve under a self-insurance program for unemployment compensation or workers' compensation are allowable to the extent that the provisions represent reasonable estimates of the liabilities for such compensation, and the types of coverage, extent of coverage, and rates and premiums would have been allowable had insurance been purchased to cover the risks. However, provisions for self-insured liabilities which do not become payable for more than one year after the provision is made must not exceed the present value of the liability.</P>
                <P>(2) Costs of insurance on the lives of trustees, officers, or other employees holding positions of similar responsibility are allowable only to the extent that the insurance represents additional compensation. The costs of such insurance when the non-Federal entity is named as beneficiary are unallowable.</P>

                <P>(3) Actual claims paid to or on behalf of employees or former employees for workers' compensation, unemployment <PRTPAGE P="309"/>compensation, severance pay, and similar employee benefits (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> post-retirement health benefits), are allowable in the year of payment provided that the non-Federal entity follows a consistent costing policy.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Automobiles.</E> That portion of automobile costs furnished by the entity that relates to personal use by employees (including transportation to and from work) is unallowable as fringe benefit or indirect (F&amp;A) costs regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to the employees.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Pension plan costs.</E> Pension plan costs which are incurred in accordance with the established policies of the non-Federal entity are allowable, provided that:</P>
                <P>(1) Such policies meet the test of reasonableness.</P>
                <P>(2) The methods of cost allocation are not discriminatory.</P>
                <P>(3) For entities using accrual based accounting, the cost assigned to each fiscal year is determined in accordance with GAAP.</P>
                <P>(4) The costs assigned to a given fiscal year are funded for all plan participants within six months after the end of that year. However, increases to normal and past service pension costs caused by a delay in funding the actuarial liability beyond 30 calendar days after each quarter of the year to which such costs are assignable are unallowable. Non-Federal entity may elect to follow the “Cost Accounting Standard for Composition and Measurement of Pension Costs” (48 CFR 9904.412).</P>
                <P>(5) Pension plan termination insurance premiums paid pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1301-1461) are allowable. Late payment charges on such premiums are unallowable. Excise taxes on accumulated funding deficiencies and other penalties imposed under ERISA are unallowable.</P>
                <P>(6) Pension plan costs may be computed using a pay-as-you-go method or an acceptable actuarial cost method in accordance with established written policies of the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(i) For pension plans financed on a pay-as-you-go method, allowable costs will be limited to those representing actual payments to retirees or their beneficiaries.</P>
                <P>(ii) Pension costs calculated using an actuarial cost-based method recognized by GAAP are allowable for a given fiscal year if they are funded for that year within six months after the end of that year. Costs funded after the six month period (or a later period agreed to by the cognizant agency for indirect costs) are allowable in the year funded. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may agree to an extension of the six month period if an appropriate adjustment is made to compensate for the timing of the charges to the Federal Government and related Federal reimbursement and the non-Federal entity's contribution to the pension fund. Adjustments may be made by cash refund or other equitable procedures to compensate the Federal Government for the time value of Federal reimbursements in excess of contributions to the pension fund.</P>
                <P>(iii) Amounts funded by the non-Federal entity in excess of the actuarially determined amount for a fiscal year may be used as the non-Federal entity's contribution in future periods.</P>
                <P>(iv) When a non-Federal entity converts to an acceptable actuarial cost method, as defined by GAAP, and funds pension costs in accordance with this method, the unfunded liability at the time of conversion is allowable if amortized over a period of years in accordance with GAAP.</P>
                <P>(v) The Federal Government must receive an equitable share of any previously allowed pension costs (including earnings thereon) which revert or inure to the non-Federal entity in the form of a refund, withdrawal, or other credit.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Post-retirement health.</E> Post-retirement health plans (PRHP) refers to costs of health insurance or health services not included in a pension plan covered by paragraph (g) of this section for retirees and their spouses, dependents, and survivors. PRHP costs may be computed using a pay-as-you-go method or an acceptable actuarial cost method in accordance with established written policies of the non-Federal entity.</P>

                <P>(1) For PRHP financed on a pay-as-you-go method, allowable costs will be limited to those representing actual <PRTPAGE P="310"/>payments to retirees or their beneficiaries.</P>
                <P>(2) PRHP costs calculated using an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP are allowable if they are funded for that year within six months after the end of that year. Costs funded after the six month period (or a later period agreed to by the cognizant agency) are allowable in the year funded. The Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs may agree to an extension of the six month period if an appropriate adjustment is made to compensate for the timing of the charges to the Federal Government and related Federal reimbursements and the non-Federal entity's contributions to the PRHP fund. Adjustments may be made by cash refund, reduction in current year's PRHP costs, or other equitable procedures to compensate the Federal Government for the time value of Federal reimbursements in excess of contributions to the PRHP fund.</P>
                <P>(3) Amounts funded in excess of the actuarially determined amount for a fiscal year may be used as the non-Federal entity contribution in a future period.</P>
                <P>(4) When a non-Federal entity converts to an acceptable actuarial cost method and funds PRHP costs in accordance with this method, the initial unfunded liability attributable to prior years is allowable if amortized over a period of years in accordance with GAAP, or, if no such GAAP period exists, over a period negotiated with the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</P>
                <P>(5) To be allowable in the current year, the PRHP costs must be paid either to:</P>
                <P>(i) An insurer or other benefit provider as current year costs or premiums, or</P>
                <P>(ii) An insurer or trustee to maintain a trust fund or reserve for the sole purpose of providing post-retirement benefits to retirees and other beneficiaries.</P>
                <P>(6) The Federal Government must receive an equitable share of any amounts of previously allowed post-retirement benefit costs (including earnings thereon) which revert or inure to the non-Federal entity in the form of a refund, withdrawal, or other credit.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Severance pay.</E> (1) Severance pay, also commonly referred to as dismissal wages, is a payment in addition to regular salaries and wages, by non-Federal entities to workers whose employment is being terminated. Costs of severance pay are allowable only to the extent that in each case, it is required by:</P>
                <P>(i) Law;</P>
                <P>(ii) Employer-employee agreement;</P>
                <P>(iii) Established policy that constitutes, in effect, an implied agreement on the non-Federal entity's part; or</P>
                <P>(iv) Circumstances of the particular employment.</P>
                <P>(2) Costs of severance payments are divided into two categories as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) Actual normal turnover severance payments must be allocated to all activities; or, where the non-Federal entity provides for a reserve for normal severances, such method will be acceptable if the charge to current operations is reasonable in light of payments actually made for normal severances over a representative past period, and if amounts charged are allocated to all activities of the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(ii) Measurement of costs of abnormal or mass severance pay by means of an accrual will not achieve equity to both parties. Thus, accruals for this purpose are not allowable. However, the Federal Government recognizes its obligation to participate, to the extent of its fair share, in any specific payment. Prior approval by the Federal awarding agency or cognizant agency for indirect cost, as appropriate, is required.</P>
                <P>(3) Costs incurred in certain severance pay packages which are in an amount in excess of the normal severance pay paid by the non-Federal entity to an employee upon termination of employment and are paid to the employee contingent upon a change in management control over, or ownership of, the non-Federal entity's assets, are unallowable.</P>

                <P>(4) Severance payments to foreign nationals employed by the non-Federal entity outside the United States, to the extent that the amount exceeds the customary or prevailing practices for the non-Federal entity in the United States, are unallowable, unless they are necessary for the performance of <PRTPAGE P="311"/>Federal programs and approved by the HHS awarding agency.</P>
                <P>(5) Severance payments to foreign nationals employed by the non-Federal entity outside the United States due to the termination of the foreign national as a result of the closing of, or curtailment of activities by, the non-Federal entity in that country, are unallowable, unless they are necessary for the performance of Federal programs and approved by the HHS awarding agency.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">For IHEs only.</E> (1) Fringe benefits in the form of undergraduate and graduate tuition or remission of tuition for individual employees are allowable, provided such benefits are granted in accordance with established non-federal entity policies, and are distributed to all non-Federal entity activities on an equitable basis. Tuition benefits for family members other than the employee are unallowable.</P>
                <P>(2) Fringe benefits in the form of tuition or remission of tuition for individual employees not employed by IHEs are limited to the tax-free amount allowed per section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code as amended.</P>
                <P>(3) IHEs may offer employees tuition waivers or tuition reductions, provided that the benefit does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Employees can exercise these benefits at other institutions according to institutional policy. See § 75.466 for treatment of tuition remission provided to students.</P>
                <P>(k) For IHEs whose costs are paid by state or local governments, fringe benefit programs (such as pension costs and FICA) and any other benefits costs specifically incurred on behalf of, and in direct benefit to, the non-Federal entity, are allowable costs of such non-Federal entities whether or not these costs are recorded in the accounting records of the non-Federal entities, subject to the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The costs meet the requirements of Basic Considerations in §§ 75.402 through 75.411;</P>
                <P>(2) The costs are properly supported by approved cost allocation plans in accordance with applicable Federal cost accounting principles; and</P>
                <P>(3) The costs are not otherwise borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government.</P>

                <P>A conference is defined as a meeting, retreat, seminar, symposium, workshop or event whose primary purpose is the dissemination of technical information beyond the non-Federal entity and is necessary and reasonable for successful performance under the Federal award. Allowable conference costs paid by the non-Federal entity as a sponsor or host of the conference may include rental of facilities, speakers' fees, costs of meals and refreshments, local transportation, and other items incidental to such conferences unless further restricted by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. As needed, the costs of identifying, but not providing, locally available dependent-care resources are allowable. Conference hosts/sponsors must exercise discretion and judgment in ensuring that conference costs are appropriate, necessary and managed in a manner that minimizes costs to the Federal award. The HHS awarding agency may authorize exceptions where appropriate for programs including Indian tribes, children, and the elderly. See also §§ 75.438, 75.456, 75.474, and 75.475.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Contingency provisions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Contingency is that part of a budget estimate of future costs (typically of large construction projects, IT systems, or other items as approved by the HHS awarding agency) which is associated with possible events or conditions arising from causes the precise outcome of which is indeterminable at the time of estimate, and that experience shows will likely result, in aggregate, in additional costs for the approved activity or project. Amounts for major project scope changes, unforeseen risks, or extraordinary events may not be included.</P>

                <P>(b) It is permissible for contingency amounts other than those excluded in paragraph (a) of this section to be explicitly included in budget estimates, to the extent they are necessary to improve the precision of those estimates. <PRTPAGE P="312"/>Amounts must be estimated using broadly-accepted cost estimating methodologies, specified in the budget documentation of the Federal award, and accepted by the HHS awarding agency. As such, contingency amounts are to be included in the Federal award. In order for actual costs incurred to be allowable, they must comply with the cost principles and other requirements in this part (see also §§ 75.300 through 75.309 of subpart D of this part and 75.403); be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives, and be verifiable from the non-Federal entity's records.</P>
                <P>(c) Payments made by the HHS awarding agency to the non-Federal entity's “contingency reserve” or any similar payment made for events the occurrence of which cannot be foretold with certainty as to the time or intensity, or with an assurance of their happening, are unallowable, except as noted in §§ 75.431 and 75.447.</P>

                <P>(a) Costs of contributions and donations, including cash, property, and services, from the non-Federal entity to other entities, are unallowable.</P>
                <P>(b) The value of services and property donated to the non-Federal entity may not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct or indirect (F&amp;A) cost. The value of donated services and property may be used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements (see § 75.306). Depreciation on donated assets is permitted in accordance with § 75.436, as long as the donated property is not counted towards cost sharing or matching requirements.</P>
                <P>(c) Services donated or volunteered to the non-Federal entity may be furnished to a non-Federal entity by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor. The value of these services may not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct or indirect cost. However, the value of donated services may be used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements in accordance with the provisions of § 75.306.</P>
                <P>(d) To the extent feasible, services donated to the non-Federal entity will be supported by the same methods used to support the allocability of regular personnel services.</P>
                <P>(e) The following provisions apply to nonprofit organizations. The value of services donated to the nonprofit organization utilized in the performance of a direct cost activity must be considered in the determination of the non-Federal entity's indirect cost rate(s) and, accordingly, must be allocated a proportionate share of applicable indirect costs when the following circumstances exist:</P>
                <P>(1) The aggregate value of the services is material;</P>
                <P>(2) The services are supported by a significant amount of the indirect costs incurred by the non-Federal entity;</P>
                <P>(i) In those instances where there is no basis for determining the fair market value of the services rendered, the non-Federal entity and the cognizant agency for indirect costs must negotiate an appropriate allocation of indirect cost to the services.</P>
                <P>(ii) Where donated services directly benefit a project supported by the Federal award, the indirect costs allocated to the services will be considered as a part of the total costs of the project. Such indirect costs may be reimbursed under the Federal award or used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements.</P>
                <P>(f) Fair market value of donated services must be computed as described in § 75.306.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Personal property and use of space.</E> (1) Donated personal property and use of space may be furnished to a non-Federal entity. The value of the personal property and space may not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct or indirect cost.</P>
                <P>(2) The value of the donations may be used to meet cost sharing or matching share requirements under the conditions described in §§ 75.300 through 75.309 of subpart D of this part. The value of the donations must be determined in accordance with §§ 75.300 through 75.309. Where donations are treated as indirect costs, indirect cost rates will separate the value of the donations so that reimbursement will not be made.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Depreciation.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Depreciation is the method for allocating the cost of fixed assets to periods benefitting from asset use. The non-Federal entity may be compensated for the use of its buildings, capital improvements, equipment, and software projects capitalized in accordance with GAAP, provided that they are used, needed in the non-Federal entity's activities, and properly allocated to Federal awards. Such compensation must be made by computing depreciation.</P>
                <P>(b) The allocation for depreciation must be made in accordance with appendices III through IX.</P>
                <P>(c) Depreciation is computed applying the following rules. The computation of depreciation must be based on the acquisition cost of the assets involved. For an asset donated to the non-Federal entity by a third party, its fair market value at the time of the donation must be considered as the acquisition cost. Such assets may be depreciated or claimed as matching but not both. For the purpose of computing depreciation, the acquisition cost will exclude:</P>
                <P>(1) The cost of land;</P>
                <P>(2) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment borne by or donated by the Federal Government, irrespective of where title was originally vested or where it is presently located;</P>
                <P>(3) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment contributed by or for the non-Federal entity, where law or agreement prohibits recovery; and</P>
                <P>(4) Any asset acquired solely for the performance of a non-Federal award.</P>
                <P>(d) When computing depreciation charges, the following must be observed:</P>

                <P>(1) The period of useful service or useful life established in each case for usable capital assets must take into consideration such factors as type of <PRTPAGE P="315"/>construction, nature of the equipment, technological developments in the particular area, historical data, and the renewal and replacement policies followed for the individual items or classes of assets involved.</P>
                <P>(2) The depreciation method used to charge the cost of an asset (or group of assets) to accounting periods must reflect the pattern of consumption of the asset during its useful life. In the absence of clear evidence indicating that the expected consumption of the asset will be significantly greater in the early portions than in the later portions of its useful life, the straight-line method must be presumed to be the appropriate method. Depreciation methods once used may not be changed unless approved in advance by the cognizant agency. The depreciation methods used to calculate the depreciation amounts for indirect (F&amp;A) rate purposes must be the same methods used by the non-Federal entity for its financial statements.</P>

                <P>(3) The entire building, including the shell and all components, may be treated as a single asset and depreciated over a single useful life. A building may also be divided into multiple components. Each component item may then be depreciated over its estimated useful life. The building components must be grouped into three general components of a building: building shell (including construction and design costs), building services systems (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> elevators, HVAC, plumbing system and heating and air-conditioning system) and fixed equipment (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> sterilizers, casework, fume hoods, cold rooms and glassware/washers). In exceptional cases, a cognizant agency may authorize a non-Federal entity to use more than these three groupings. When a non-Federal entity elects to depreciate its buildings by its components, the same depreciation methods must be used for indirect (F&amp;A) purposes and financial statements purposes, as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) No depreciation may be allowed on any assets that have outlived their depreciable lives.</P>

                <P>(5) Where the depreciation method is introduced to replace the use allowance method, depreciation must be computed as if the asset had been depreciated over its entire life (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> from the date the asset was acquired and ready for use to the date of disposal or withdrawal from service). The total amount of use allowance and depreciation for an asset (including imputed depreciation applicable to periods prior to the conversion from the use allowance method as well as depreciation after the conversion) may not exceed the total acquisition cost of the asset.</P>
                <P>(e) Charges for depreciation must be supported by adequate property records, and physical inventories must be taken at least once every two years to ensure that the assets exist and are usable, used, and needed. Statistical sampling techniques may be used in taking these inventories. In addition, adequate depreciation records showing the amount of depreciation taken each period must also be maintained.</P>

                <P>(b) Such costs will be equitably apportioned to all activities of the non-Federal entity. Income generated from any of these activities will be credited to the cost thereof unless such income has been irrevocably sent to employee welfare organizations.</P>
                <P>(c) Losses resulting from operating food services are allowable only if the non-Federal entity's objective is to operate such services on a break-even basis. Losses sustained because of operating objectives other than the above are allowable only:</P>
                <P>(1) Where the non-Federal entity can demonstrate unusual circumstances; and</P>

                <P>(3) Capital expenditures for improvements to land, buildings, or equipment which materially increase their value or useful life are unallowable as a direct cost except with the prior written approval of the HHS awarding agency, or pass-through entity. See § 75.436 for rules on the allowability of depreciation on buildings, capital improvements, and equipment. See also § 75.465.</P>

                <P>(5) The unamortized portion of any equipment written off as a result of a change in capitalization levels may be recovered by continuing to claim the otherwise allowable depreciation on the equipment, or by amortizing the amount to be written off over a period of years negotiated with the Federal cognizant agency for indirect cost.</P>
                <P>(6) Cost of equipment disposal. If the non-Federal entity is instructed by the HHS awarding agency to otherwise dispose of or transfer the equipment the costs of such disposal or transfer are allowable.</P>

Prior approval of exchange rate fluctuations is required only when the change results in the need for additional Federal funding, or the increased costs result in the need to significantly reduce the scope of the project.

                <P>(a) As used in this section the following terms have the meanings set forth in this section:</P>
                <P>(1) Facilities means land and buildings or any portion thereof, equipment individually or collectively, or any other tangible capital asset, wherever located, and whether owned or leased by the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(2) Idle facilities means completely unused facilities that are excess to the non-Federal entity's current needs.</P>
                <P>(3) Idle capacity means the unused capacity of partially used facilities. It is the difference between:</P>
                <P>(i) That which a facility could achieve under 100 percent operating time on a one-shift basis less operating interruptions resulting from time lost for repairs, setups, unsatisfactory materials, and other normal delays and;</P>
                <P>(ii) The extent to which the facility was actually used to meet demands during the accounting period. A multi-shift basis should be used if it can be shown that this amount of usage would normally be expected for the type of facility involved.</P>

                <P>(4) Cost of idle facilities or idle capacity means costs such as maintenance, repair, housing, rent, and other related costs, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> insurance, interest, and depreciation. These costs could include the costs of idle public safety emergency facilities, telecommunications, or information technology system capacity that is built to withstand major fluctuations in load, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> consolidated data centers.</P>
                <P>(b) The costs of idle facilities are unallowable except to the extent that:</P>
                <P>(1) They are necessary to meet workload requirements which may fluctuate and are allocated appropriately to all benefiting programs; or</P>
                <P>(2) Although not necessary to meet fluctuations in workload, they were necessary when acquired and are now idle because of changes in program requirements, efforts to achieve more economical operations, reorganization, termination, or other causes which could not have been reasonably foreseen. Under the exception stated in this subsection, costs of idle facilities are allowable for a reasonable period of time, ordinarily not to exceed one year, depending on the initiative taken to use, lease, or dispose of such facilities.</P>
                <P>(c) The costs of idle capacity are normal costs of doing business and are a factor in the normal fluctuations of usage or indirect cost rates from period to period. Such costs are allowable, provided that the capacity is reasonably anticipated to be necessary to carry out the purpose of the Federal award or was originally reasonable and is not subject to reduction or elimination by use on other Federal awards, subletting, renting, or sale, in accordance with sound business, economic, or security practices. Widespread idle capacity throughout an entire facility or among a group of assets having substantially the same function may be considered idle facilities.</P>

                <P>(3) Costs allowed for business interruption or other similar insurance must exclude coverage of management fees.</P>
                <P>(4) Costs of insurance on the lives of trustees, officers, or other employees holding positions of similar responsibilities are allowable only to the extent that the insurance represents additional compensation (see § 75.431). The cost of such insurance when the non-Federal entity is identified as the beneficiary is unallowable.</P>
                <P>(5) Insurance against defects. Costs of insurance with respect to any costs incurred to correct defects in the non-Federal entity's materials or workmanship are unallowable.</P>
                <P>(6) Medical liability (malpractice) insurance. Medical liability insurance is an allowable cost of Federal research programs only to the extent that the Federal research programs involve human subjects or training of participants in research techniques. Medical liability insurance costs must be treated as a direct cost and must be assigned to individual projects based on the manner in which the insurer allocates the risk to the population covered by the insurance.</P>
                <P>(c) Actual losses which could have been covered by permissible insurance (through a self-insurance program or otherwise) are unallowable, unless expressly provided for in the Federal award. However, costs incurred because of losses not covered under nominal deductible insurance coverage provided in keeping with sound management practice, and minor losses not covered by insurance, such as spoilage, breakage, and disappearance of small hand tools, which occur in the ordinary course of operations, are allowable.</P>
                <P>(d) Contributions to a reserve for certain self-insurance programs including workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, and severance pay are allowable subject to the following provisions:</P>
                <P>(1) The type of coverage and the extent of coverage and the rates and premiums would have been allowed had insurance (including reinsurance) been purchased to cover the risks. However, provision for known or reasonably estimated self-insured liabilities, which do not become payable for more than one year after the provision is made, must not exceed the discounted present value of the liability. The rate used for discounting the liability must be determined by giving consideration to such factors as the non-Federal entity's settlement rate for those liabilities and its investment rate of return.</P>
                <P>(2) Earnings or investment income on reserves must be credited to those reserves.</P>
                <P>(3)(i) Contributions to reserves must be based on sound actuarial principles using historical experience and reasonable assumptions. Reserve levels must be analyzed and updated at least biennially for each major risk being insured and take into account any reinsurance, coinsurance, etc. Reserve levels related to employee-related coverages will normally be limited to the value of claims:</P>

                <P>(B) Submitted but not adjudicated; and</P>
                <P>(C) Incurred but not submitted.</P>
                <P>(ii) Reserve levels in excess of the amounts based on the above must be identified and justified in the cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal.</P>
                <P>(4) Accounting records, actuarial studies, and cost allocations (or billings) must recognize any significant differences due to types of insured risk and losses generated by the various insured activities or agencies of the non-Federal entity. If individual departments or agencies of the non-Federal entity experience significantly different levels of claims for a particular risk, those differences are to be recognized by the use of separate allocations or other techniques resulting in an equitable allocation.</P>

                <P>(5) Whenever funds are transferred from a self-insurance reserve to other accounts (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> general fund or unrestricted account), refunds must be made to the Federal Government for its share of funds transferred, including earned or imputed interest from the <PRTPAGE P="320"/>date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable Federal cognizant agency for indirect cost, claims collection regulations.</P>
                <P>(e) Insurance refunds must be credited against insurance costs in the year the refund is received.</P>
                <P>(f) Indemnification includes securing the non-Federal entity against liabilities to third persons and other losses not compensated by insurance or otherwise. The Federal Government is obligated to indemnify the non-Federal entity only to the extent expressly provided for in the Federal award, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Interest.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Costs incurred for interest on borrowed capital, temporary use of endowment funds, or the use of the non-Federal entity's own funds, however represented, are unallowable. Financing costs (including interest) to acquire, construct, or replace capital assets are allowable, subject to the conditions in this section.</P>

                <P>(b)(1) Capital assets is defined as noted in § 75.2 <E T="03">Capital assets.</E> An asset cost includes (as applicable) acquisition costs, construction costs, and other costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP.</P>

                <P>(2) For non-Federal entity fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, intangible assets include patents <PRTPAGE P="321"/>and computer software. For software development projects, only interest attributable to the portion of the project costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP is allowable.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Conditions for all non-Federal entities.</E> (1) The non-Federal entity uses the capital assets in support of Federal awards;</P>
                <P>(2) The allowable asset costs to acquire facilities and equipment are limited to a fair market value available to the non-Federal entity from an unrelated (arm's length) third party.</P>
                <P>(3) The non-Federal entity obtains the financing via an arm's-length transaction (that is, a transaction with an unrelated third party); or claims reimbursement of actual interest cost at a rate available via such a transaction.</P>
                <P>(4) The non-Federal entity limits claims for Federal reimbursement of interest costs to the least expensive alternative. For example, a capital lease may be determined less costly than purchasing through debt financing, in which case reimbursement must be limited to the amount of interest determined if leasing had been used.</P>
                <P>(5) The non-Federal entity expenses or capitalizes allowable interest cost in accordance with GAAP.</P>
                <P>(6) Earnings generated by the investment of borrowed funds pending their disbursement for the asset costs are used to offset the current period's allowable interest cost, whether that cost is expensed or capitalized. Earnings subject to being reported to the Federal Internal Revenue Service under arbitrage requirements are excludable.</P>
                <P>(7) The following conditions must apply to debt arrangements over $1 million to purchase or construct facilities, unless the non-Federal entity makes an initial equity contribution to the purchase of 25 percent or more. For this purpose, “initial equity contribution” means the amount or value of contributions made by the non-Federal entity for the acquisition of facilities prior to occupancy.</P>
                <P>(i) The non-Federal entity must reduce claims for reimbursement of interest cost by an amount equal to imputed interest earnings on excess cash flow attributable to the portion of the facility used for Federal awards.</P>
                <P>(ii) The non-Federal entity must impute interest on excess cash flow as follows:</P>
                <P>(A) Annually, the non-Federal entity must prepare a cumulative (from the inception of the project) report of monthly cash inflows and outflows, regardless of the funding source. For this purpose, inflows consist of Federal reimbursement for depreciation, amortization of capitalized construction interest, and annual interest cost. Outflows consist of initial equity contributions, debt principal payments (less the pro-rata share attributable to the cost of land), and interest payments.</P>
                <P>(B) To compute monthly cash inflows and outflows, the non-Federal entity must divide the annual amounts determined in step (i) by the number of months in the year (usually 12) that the building is in service.</P>
                <P>(C) For any month in which cumulative cash inflows exceed cumulative outflows, interest must be calculated on the excess inflows for that month and be treated as a reduction to allowable interest cost. The rate of interest to be used must be the three-month Treasury bill closing rate as of the last business day of that month.</P>
                <P>(8) Interest attributable to a fully depreciated asset is unallowable.</P>
                <P>(d) Additional conditions for states, local governments and Indian tribes. For costs to be allowable, the non-Federal entity must have incurred the interest costs for buildings after October 1, 1980, or for land and equipment after September 1, 1995.</P>
                <P>(1) The requirement to offset interest earned on borrowed funds against current allowable interest cost (paragraph (c)(5) of this section) also applies to earnings on debt service reserve funds.</P>
                <P>(2) The non-Federal entity will negotiate the amount of allowable interest cost related to the acquisition of facilities with asset costs of $1 million or more, as outlined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. For this purpose, a non-Federal entity must consider only cash inflows and outflows attributable to that portion of the real property used for Federal awards.</P>

                <P>(e) Additional conditions for IHEs. For costs to be allowable, the IHE must have incurred the interest costs after July 1, 1982, in connection with <PRTPAGE P="322"/>acquisitions of capital assets that occurred after that date.</P>
                <P>(f) Additional condition for nonprofit organizations. For costs to be allowable, the nonprofit organization incurred the interest costs after September 29, 1995, in connection with acquisitions of capital assets that occurred after that date.</P>
                <P>(g) The interest allowability provisions of this section do not apply to a nonprofit organization subject to “full coverage” under the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), as defined at 48 CFR 9903.201-2(a). The non-Federal entity's Federal awards are instead subject to CAS 414 (48 CFR 9904.414), and CAS 417 (48 CFR 9904.417).</P>

                <P>(a) The cost of certain influencing activities associated with obtaining grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, or loans is an unallowable cost. Lobbying with respect to certain grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and loans is governed by relevant statutes, including among others, the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 1352, as well as the common rule, “New Restrictions on Lobbying” published at 55 FR 6736 (February 26, 1990), including definitions, and the Office of Management and Budget “Government-wide Guidance for New Restrictions on Lobbying” and notices published at 54 FR 52306 (December 20, 1989), 55 FR 24540 (June 15, 1990), 57 FR 1772 (January 15, 1992), and 61 FR 1412 (January 19, 1996).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Executive lobbying costs.</E> Costs incurred in attempting to improperly influence either directly or indirectly, an employee or officer of the executive branch of the Federal Government to give consideration or to act regarding a Federal award or a regulatory matter are unallowable. Improper influence means any influence that induces or tends to induce a Federal employee or officer to give consideration or to act regarding a Federal award or regulatory matter on any basis other than the merits of the matter.</P>
                <P>(c) In addition to the above, the following restrictions are applicable to nonprofit organizations and IHEs:</P>
                <P>(1) Costs associated with the following activities are unallowable:</P>
                <P>(i) Attempts to influence the outcomes of any Federal, state, or local election, referendum, initiative, or similar procedure, through in-kind or cash contributions, endorsements, publicity, or similar activity;</P>

                <P>(iii) Any attempt to influence:</P>
                <P>(A) The introduction of Federal or state legislation;</P>
                <P>(B) The enactment or modification of any pending Federal or state legislation through communication with any member or employee of the Congress or state legislature (including efforts to influence state or local officials to engage in similar lobbying activity);</P>
                <P>(C) The enactment or modification of any pending Federal or state legislation by preparing, distributing, or using publicity or propaganda, or by urging members of the general public, or any segment thereof, to contribute to or participate in any mass demonstration, march, rally, fund raising drive, lobbying campaign or letter writing or telephone campaign; or</P>
                <P>(D) Any government official or employee in connection with a decision to sign or veto enrolled legislation;</P>
                <P>(iv) Legislative liaison activities, including attendance at legislative sessions or committee hearings, gathering information regarding legislation, and analyzing the effect of legislation, when such activities are carried on in support of or in knowing preparation for an effort to engage in unallowable lobbying.</P>
                <P>(2) The following activities are excepted from the coverage of paragraph (c)(1) of this section:</P>

                <P>(i) Technical and factual presentations on topics directly related to the performance of a grant, contract, or other agreement (through hearing testimony, statements, or letters to the Congress or a state legislature, or subdivision, member, or cognizant staff <PRTPAGE P="323"/>member thereof), in response to a documented request (including a Congressional Record notice requesting testimony or statements for the record at a regularly scheduled hearing) made by the non-Federal entity's member of congress, legislative body or a subdivision, or a cognizant staff member thereof, provided such information is readily obtainable and can be readily put in deliverable form, and further provided that costs under this section for travel, lodging or meals are unallowable unless incurred to offer testimony at a regularly scheduled Congressional hearing pursuant to a written request for such presentation made by the Chairman or Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee conducting such hearings;</P>
                <P>(ii) Any lobbying made unallowable by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section to influence state legislation in order to directly reduce the cost, or to avoid material impairment of the non-Federal entity's authority to perform the grant, contract, or other agreement; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Any activity specifically authorized by statute to be undertaken with funds from the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(iv) Any activity excepted from the definitions of “lobbying” or “influencing legislation” by the Internal Revenue Code provisions that require nonprofit organizations to limit their participation in direct and “grass roots” lobbying activities in order to retain their charitable deduction status and avoid punitive excise taxes, I.R.C. sections 501(c)(3), 501(h), 4911(a), including:</P>
                <P>(A) Nonpartisan analysis, study, or research reports;</P>
                <P>(B) Examinations and discussions of broad social, economic, and similar problems; and</P>
                <P>(C) Information provided upon request by a legislator for technical advice and assistance, as defined by IRC sec. 4911(d)(2) and 26 CFR 56.4911-2(c)(1)-(c)(3).</P>
                <P>(v) When a non-Federal entity seeks reimbursement for indirect (F&amp;A) costs, total lobbying costs must be separately identified in the indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate proposal, and thereafter treated as other unallowable activity costs in accordance with the procedures of § 75.413.</P>
                <P>(vi) The non-Federal entity must submit as part of its annual indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate proposal a certification that the requirements and standards of this section have been complied with. (See also § 75.415.)</P>
                <P>(vii)(A) Time logs, calendars, or similar records are not required to be created for purposes of complying with the record keeping requirements in § 75.302 with respect to lobbying costs during any particular calendar month when:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The employee engages in lobbying (as defined in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section) 25 percent or less of the employee's compensated hours of employment during that calendar month; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Within the preceding five-year period, the non-Federal entity has not materially misstated allowable or unallowable costs of any nature, including legislative lobbying costs.</P>
                <P>(B) When conditions in paragraph (c)(2)(vii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section are met, non-Federal entities are not required to establish records to support the allowability of claimed costs in addition to records already required or maintained. Also, when conditions in paragraphs (c)(2)(vii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section are met, the absence of time logs, calendars, or similar records will not serve as a basis for disallowing costs by contesting estimates of lobbying time spent by employees during a calendar month.</P>
                <P>(viii) The HHS awarding agency must establish procedures for resolving in advance, in consultation with OMB, any significant questions or disagreements concerning the interpretation or application of this section. Any such advance resolutions must be binding in any subsequent settlements, audits, or investigations with respect to that grant or contract for purposes of interpretation of this part, provided, however, that this must not be construed to prevent a contractor or non-Federal entity from contesting the lawfulness of such a determination.</P>

                <P>(a) Relocation costs are costs incident to the permanent change of duty assignment (for an indefinite period or for a stated period of not less than 12 months) of an existing employee or upon recruitment of a new employee. Relocation costs are allowable, subject to the limitations described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, provided that:</P>
                <P>(1) The move is for the benefit of the employer.</P>

                <P>(2) Reimbursement to the employee is in accordance with an established written policy consistently followed by the employer.<PRTPAGE P="327"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) The reimbursement does not exceed the employee's actual (or reasonably estimated) expenses.</P>
                <P>(b) Allowable relocation costs for current employees are limited to the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The costs of transportation of the employee, members of his or her immediate family and his household, and personal effects to the new location.</P>
                <P>(2) The costs of finding a new home, such as advance trips by employees and spouses to locate living quarters and temporary lodging during the transition period, up to maximum period of 30 calendar days.</P>
                <P>(3) Closing costs, such as brokerage, legal, and appraisal fees, incident to the disposition of the employee's former home. These costs, together with those described in (4), are limited to 8 per cent of the sales price of the employee's former home.</P>
                <P>(4) The continuing costs of ownership (for up to six months) of the vacant former home after the settlement or lease date of the employee's new permanent home, such as maintenance of buildings and grounds (exclusive of fixing-up expenses), utilities, taxes, and property insurance.</P>
                <P>(5) Other necessary and reasonable expenses normally incident to relocation, such as the costs of canceling an unexpired lease, transportation of personal property, and purchasing insurance against loss of or damages to personal property. The cost of canceling an unexpired lease is limited to three times the monthly rental.</P>
                <P>(c) Allowable relocation costs for new employees are limited to those described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. When relocation costs incurred incident to the recruitment of new employees have been charged to a Federal award and the employee resigns for reasons within the employee's control within 12 months after hire, the non-Federal entity must refund or credit the Federal Government for its share of the cost. However, the costs of travel to an overseas location must be considered travel costs in accordance with § 75.474, and not § 75.464, for the purpose of this paragraph if dependents are not permitted at the location for any reason and the costs do not include costs of transporting household goods.</P>
                <P>(d) The following costs related to relocation are unallowable:</P>
                <P>(1) Fees and other costs associated with acquiring a new home.</P>
                <P>(2) A loss on the sale of a former home.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Rental costs of real property and equipment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Subject to the limitations described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, rental costs are allowable to the extent that the rates are reasonable in light of such factors as: Rental costs of comparable property, if any; market conditions in the area; alternatives available; and the type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the property leased. Rental arrangements should be reviewed periodically to determine if circumstances have changed and other options are available.</P>
                <P>(b) Rental costs under “sale and lease back” arrangements are allowable only up to the amount that would be allowed had the non-Federal entity continued to own the property. This amount would include expenses such as depreciation, maintenance, taxes, and insurance.</P>
                <P>(c) Rental costs under “less-than-arm's-length” leases are allowable only up to the amount as explained in paragraph (b) of this section. For this purpose, a less-than-arm's-length lease is one under which one party to the lease agreement is able to control or substantially influence the actions of the other. Such leases include, but are not limited to those between:</P>
                <P>(1) Divisions of the non-Federal entity;</P>
                <P>(2) The non-Federal entity under common control through common officers, directors, or members; and</P>

                <P>(3) The non-Federal entity and a director, trustee, officer, or key employee of the non-Federal entity or an immediate family member, either directly or through corporations, trusts, or similar arrangements in which they hold a controlling interest. For example, the non-Federal entity may establish a separate corporation for the sole <PRTPAGE P="328"/>purpose of owning property and leasing it back to the non-Federal entity.</P>
                <P>(4) Family members include one party with any of the following relationships to another party:</P>
                <P>(i) Spouse, and parents thereof;</P>
                <P>(ii) Children, and spouses thereof;</P>

                <P>(v) Grandparents and grandchildren, and spouses thereof;</P>
                <P>(vi) Domestic partner and parents thereof, including domestic partners of any individual in 2 through 5 of this definition; and</P>
                <P>(vii) Any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.</P>
                <P>(5) Rental costs under leases which are required to be treated as capital leases under GAAP are allowable only up to the amount (as explained in paragraph (b) of this section) that would be allowed had the non-Federal entity purchased the property on the date the lease agreement was executed. The provisions of GAAP must be used to determine whether a lease is a capital lease. Interest costs related to capital leases are allowable to the extent they meet the criteria in § 75.449. Unallowable costs include amounts paid for profit, management fees, and taxes that would not have been incurred had the non-Federal entity purchased the property.</P>
                <P>(6) The rental of any property owned by any individuals or entities affiliated with the non-Federal entity, to include commercial or residential real estate, for purposes such as the home office workspace is unallowable.</P>

                <P>(1) Does not discriminate between activities under Federal awards and other activities of the non-Federal entity, including usage by the non-Federal entity for internal purposes, and</P>
                <P>(2) Is designed to recover only the aggregate costs of the services. The costs of each service must consist normally of both its direct costs and its allocable share of all indirect (F&amp;A) costs.

                <P>(1) Taxes that a governmental unit is legally required to pay are allowable, except for self-assessed taxes that disproportionately affect Federal programs or changes in tax policies that disproportionately affect Federal programs.</P>
                <P>(2) Gasoline taxes, motor vehicle fees, and other taxes that are in effect user fees for benefits provided to the Federal Government are allowable.</P>
                <P>(3) This provision does not restrict the authority of the HHS awarding agency to identify taxes where Federal participation is inappropriate. Where the identification of the amount of unallowable taxes would require an inordinate amount of effort, the cognizant agency for indirect costs may accept a reasonable approximation thereof.</P>
                <P>(b) For nonprofit organizations and IHEs:</P>
                <P>(1) In general, taxes which the non-Federal entity is required to pay and which are paid or accrued in accordance with GAAP, and payments made to local governments in lieu of taxes which are commensurate with the local government services received are allowable, except for:</P>
                <P>(i) Taxes from which exemptions are available to the non-Federal entity directly or which are available to the non-Federal entity based on an exemption afforded the Federal Government and, in the latter case, when the HHS awarding agency makes available the necessary exemption certificates,</P>
                <P>(ii) Special assessments on land which represent capital improvements, and</P>
                <P>(iii) Federal income taxes.</P>
                <P>(2) Any refund of taxes, and any payment to the non-Federal entity of interest thereon, which were allowed as Federal award costs, will be credited either as a cost reduction or cash refund, as appropriate, to the Federal Government. However, any interest actually paid or credited to an non-Federal entity incident to a refund of tax, interest, and penalty will be paid or credited to the Federal Government only to the extent that such interest accrued over the period during which the non-Federal entity has been reimbursed by the Federal Government for the taxes, interest, and penalties.</P>

                <P>(c) Value Added Tax (VAT) Foreign taxes charged for the purchase of goods or services that a non-Federal entity is legally required to pay in country is an allowable expense under Federal awards. Foreign tax refunds or applicable credits under Federal awards refer to receipts, or reduction of expenditures, which operate to offset or reduce expense items that are allocable to Federal awards as direct or indirect costs. To the extent that such credits accrued or received by the non-Federal entity relate to allowable cost, these costs must be credited to the HHS awarding agency either as costs or cash refunds. If the costs are credited back to the Federal award, the non-Federal entity may reduce the Federal share of <PRTPAGE P="330"/>costs by the amount of the foreign tax reimbursement, or where Federal award has not expired, use the foreign government tax refund for approved activities under the Federal award with prior approval of the HHS awarding agency.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Termination costs.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Termination of a Federal award generally gives rise to the incurrence of costs, or the need for special treatment of costs, which would not have arisen had the Federal award not been terminated. Cost principles covering these items are set forth in this section. They are to be used in conjunction with the other provisions of this part in termination situations.</P>
                <P>(a) The cost of items reasonably usable on the non-Federal entity's other work must not be allowable unless the non-Federal entity submits evidence that it would not retain such items at cost without sustaining a loss. In deciding whether such items are reasonably usable on other work of the non-Federal entity, the HHS awarding agency should consider the non-Federal entity's plans and orders for current and scheduled activity. Contemporaneous purchases of common items by the non-Federal entity must be regarded as evidence that such items are reasonably usable on the non-Federal entity's other work. Any acceptance of common items as allocable to the terminated portion of the Federal award must be limited to the extent that the quantities of such items on hand, in transit, and on order are in excess of the reasonable quantitative requirements of other work.</P>
                <P>(b) If in a particular case, despite all reasonable efforts by the non-Federal entity, certain costs cannot be discontinued immediately after the effective date of termination, such costs are generally allowable within the limitations set forth in this part, except that any such costs continuing after termination due to the negligent or willful failure of the non-Federal entity to discontinue such costs must be unallowable.</P>
                <P>(c) Loss of useful value of special tooling, machinery, and equipment is generally allowable if:</P>
                <P>(1) Such special tooling, special machinery, or equipment is not reasonably capable of use in the other work of the non-Federal entity,</P>
                <P>(2) The interest of the Federal Government is protected by transfer of title or by other means deemed appropriate by the HHS awarding agency (see also § 75.320(d)), and</P>
                <P>(3) The loss of useful value for any one terminated Federal award is limited to that portion of the acquisition cost which bears the same ratio to the total acquisition cost as the terminated portion of the Federal award bears to the entire terminated Federal award and other Federal awards for which the special tooling, machinery, or equipment was acquired.</P>
                <P>(d) Rental costs under unexpired leases are generally allowable where clearly shown to have been reasonably necessary for the performance of the terminated Federal award less the residual value of such leases, if:</P>
                <P>(1) The amount of such rental claimed does not exceed the reasonable use value of the property leased for the period of the Federal award and such further period as may be reasonable, and</P>
                <P>(2) The non-Federal entity makes all reasonable efforts to terminate, assign, settle, or otherwise reduce the cost of such lease. There also may be included the cost of alterations of such leased property, provided such alterations were necessary for the performance of the Federal award, and of reasonable restoration required by the provisions of the lease.</P>
                <P>(e) Settlement expenses including the following are generally allowable:</P>
                <P>(1) Accounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs reasonably necessary for:</P>
                <P>(i) The preparation and presentation to the Federal awarding agency of settlement claims and supporting data with respect to the terminated portion of the Federal award, unless the termination is for cause (see subpart D of this part, §§ 75.371 through 75.375); and</P>
                <P>(ii) The termination and settlement of subawards.</P>

                <P>(2) Reasonable costs for the storage, transportation, protection, and disposition of property provided by the Federal Government or acquired or produced for the Federal award.<PRTPAGE P="331"/>
                </P>
                <P>(f) Claims under subawards, including the allocable portion of claims which are common to the Federal award and to other work of the non-Federal entity, are generally allowable. An appropriate share of the non-Federal entity's indirect costs may be allocated to the amount of settlements with contractors and/or subrecipients, provided that the amount allocated is otherwise consistent with the basic guidelines contained in § 75.414. The indirect costs so allocated must exclude the same and similar costs claimed directly or indirectly as settlement expenses.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Travel costs.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Travel costs are the expenses for transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items incurred by employees who are in travel status on official business of the non-Federal entity. Such costs may be charged on an actual cost basis, on a per diem or mileage basis in lieu of actual costs incurred, or on a combination of the two, provided the method used is applied to an entire trip and not to selected days of the trip, and results in charges consistent with those normally allowed in like circumstances in the non-Federal entity's non-federally-funded activities and in accordance with non-Federal entity's written travel reimbursement policies. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 75.444, travel costs of officials covered by that section are allowable with the prior written approval of the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity when they are specifically related to the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Lodging and subsistence.</E> Costs incurred by employees and officers for travel, including costs of lodging, other subsistence, and incidental expenses, must be considered reasonable and otherwise allowable only to the extent such costs do not exceed charges normally allowed by the non-Federal entity in its regular operations as the result of the non-Federal entity's written travel policy. In addition, if these costs are charged directly to the Federal award documentation must justify that:</P>
                <P>(1) Participation of the individual is necessary to the Federal award; and</P>
                <P>(2) The costs are reasonable and consistent with non-Federal entity's established travel policy.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) Temporary dependent care costs (as dependent is defined in 26 U.S.C. 152) above and beyond regular dependent care that directly results from travel to conferences is allowable provided that:</P>
                <P>(i) The costs are a direct result of the individual's travel for the Federal award;</P>
                <P>(ii) The costs are consistent with the non-Federal entity's documented travel policy for all entity travel; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Are only temporary during the travel period.</P>
                <P>(2) Travel costs for dependents are unallowable, except for travel of duration of six months or more with prior approval of the HHS awarding agency. See also § 75.432.</P>

                <P>(d) In the absence of an acceptable, written non-Federal entity policy regarding travel costs, the rates and amounts established under 5 U.S.C. 5701-11 (“Travel and Subsistence Expenses: Mileage Allowance”), or by the Administrator of General Services, or by the President (or his or her designee) pursuant to any provisions of such subchapter must apply to travel under Federal awards (48 CFR 31.205-46(a)).<PRTPAGE P="332"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Commercial air travel.</E> (1) Airfare costs in excess of the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines are unallowable except when such accommodations would:</P>
                <P>(i) Require circuitous routing;</P>
                <P>(ii) Require travel during unreasonable hours;</P>
                <P>(iii) Excessively prolong travel;</P>
                <P>(iv) Result in additional costs that would offset the transportation savings; or</P>
                <P>(v) Offer accommodations not reasonably adequate for the traveler's medical needs. The non-Federal entity must justify and document these conditions on a case-by-case basis in order for the use of first-class or business-class airfare to be allowable in such cases.</P>
                <P>(2) Unless a pattern of avoidance is detected, the Federal Government will generally not question a non-Federal entity's determinations that customary standard airfare or other discount airfare is unavailable for specific trips if the non-Federal entity can demonstrate that such airfare was not available in the specific case.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Air travel by other than commercial carrier.</E> Costs of travel by non-Federal entity-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft include the cost of lease, charter, operation (including personnel costs), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and other related costs. The portion of such costs that exceeds the cost of airfare as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section, is unallowable.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Audit requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Audit required.</E> A non-Federal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this part.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Single audit.</E> A non-Federal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in <PRTPAGE P="333"/>Federal awards must have a single audit conducted in accordance with § 75.514 except when it elects to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Program-specific audit election.</E> When an auditee expends Federal awards under only one Federal program (excluding R&amp;D) and the Federal program's statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award do not require a financial statement audit of the auditee, the auditee may elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with § 75.507. A program-specific audit may not be elected for R&amp;D unless all of the Federal awards expended were received from the same Federal agency, or the same Federal agency and the same pass-through entity, and that Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, approves in advance a program-specific audit.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $750,000.</E> A non-Federal entity that expends less than $750,000 during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards is exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted in § 75.503, but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and Government Accountability Office (GAO).</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC).</E> Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Subrecipients and contractors.</E> An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. Federal awards expended as a recipient or a subrecipient are subject to audit under this part. The payments received for goods or services provided as a contractor are not Federal awards. Section 75.351 sets forth the considerations in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods or services provided as a contractor.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Compliance responsibility for contractors.</E> In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for contractors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards. Federal award compliance requirements normally do not pass through to contractors. However, the auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for procurement transactions which are structured such that the contractor is responsible for program compliance or the contractor's records must be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these procurement transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit must include determining whether these transactions are in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">For-profit subrecipient.</E> Since this part does not apply to for-profit subrecipients, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements, as necessary, to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients. The agreement with the for-profit subrecipient must describe applicable compliance requirements and the for-profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits. See also § 75.352.</P>
                <P>(i) Recipients and subrecipients that are commercial organizations (including for-profit hospitals) have two options regarding audits:</P>
                <P>(1) A financial related audit (as defined in the Government Auditing Standards, GPO Stock #020-000-00-265-4) of a particular award in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, in those cases where the recipient receives awards under only one HHS program; or, if awards are received under multiple HHS programs, a financial related audit of all HHS awards in accordance with Government Auditing Standards; or</P>
                <P>(2) An audit that meets the requirements contained in this subpart.</P>

                <P>(j) Commercial organizations that receive annual HHS awards totaling less than $750,000 are exempt from requirements for a non-Federal audit for that <PRTPAGE P="334"/>year, but records must be available for review by appropriate officials of Federal agencies.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Basis for determining Federal awards expended.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Determining Federal awards expended.</E> The determination of when a Federal award is expended must be based on when the activity related to the Federal award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards, such as: expenditure/expense transactions associated with awards including grants, cost-reimbursement contracts under the FAR, compacts with Indian Tribes, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or use of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and the period when insurance is in force.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Loan and loan guarantees (loans).</E> Since the Federal Government is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid, the following guidelines must be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under loan programs, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section:</P>
                <P>(1) Value of new loans made or received during the audit period; plus</P>
                <P>(2) Beginning of the audit period balance of loans from previous years for which the Federal Government imposes continuing compliance requirements; plus</P>
                <P>(3) Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance received.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at IHEs.</E> When loans are made to students of an IHE but the IHE does not make the loans, then only the value of loans made during the audit period must be considered Federal awards expended in that audit period. The balance of loans for previous audit periods is not included as Federal awards expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans).</E> Loans, the proceeds of which were received and expended in prior years, are not considered Federal awards expended under this part when the Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards pertaining to such loans impose no continuing compliance requirements other than to repay the loans.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Endowment funds.</E> The cumulative balance of Federal awards for endowment funds that are federally restricted are considered Federal awards expended in each audit period in which the funds are still restricted.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Free rent.</E> Free rent received by itself is not considered a Federal award expended under this part. However, free rent received as part of a Federal award to carry out a Federal program must be included in determining Federal awards expended and subject to audit under this part.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Valuing non-cash assistance.</E> Federal non-cash assistance, such as free rent, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property, must be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by the HHS agency.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Medicare.</E> Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for providing patient care services to Medicare-eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Medicaid.</E> Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing patient care services to Medicaid-eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a state requires the funds to be treated as Federal awards expended because reimbursement is on a cost-reimbursement basis.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Certain loans provided by the National Credit Union Administration.</E> For purposes of this part, loans made from the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and the Central Liquidity Facility that are funded by contributions from insured non-Federal entities are not considered Federal awards expended.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Relation to other audit requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) An audit conducted in accordance with this part must be in lieu of any financial audit of Federal awards which a non-Federal entity is required to undergo under any other Federal statute or regulation. To the extent that such audit provides a Federal agency with the information it requires to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation, a Federal agency must rely upon and use that information.</P>
                <P>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a Federal agency, Inspectors General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits which are necessary to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation. The provisions of this part do not authorize any non-Federal entity to constrain, in any manner, such Federal agency from carrying out or arranging for such additional audits, except that the Federal agency must plan such audits to not be duplicative of other audits of Federal awards. Prior to commencing such an audit, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must review the FAC for recent audits submitted by the non-Federal entity, and to the extent such audits meet a Federal agency or pass-through entity's needs, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must rely upon and use such audits. Any additional audits must be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed, including the audit documentation, sampling, and testing already performed, by other auditors.</P>
                <P>(c) The provisions of this part do not limit the authority of Federal agencies to conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of Federal awards, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal official. For example, requirements that may be applicable under the FAR or CAS and the terms and conditions of a cost-reimbursement contract may include additional applicable audits to be conducted or arranged for by Federal agencies.</P>
                <P>(d) Federal agency to pay for additional audits. A Federal agency that conducts or arranges for additional audits must, consistent with other applicable Federal statutes and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits.</P>
                <P>(e) Request for a program to be audited as a major program. An HHS awarding agency may request that an auditee have a particular Federal program audited as a major program in lieu of the HHS awarding agency conducting or arranging for the additional audits. To allow for planning, such requests should be made at least 180 calendar days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited. The auditee, after consultation with its auditor, should promptly respond to such a request by informing the HHS awarding agency whether the program would otherwise be audited as a major program using the risk-based audit approach described in § 75.518 and, if not, the estimated incremental cost. The HHS awarding agency must then promptly confirm to the auditee whether it wants the program audited as a major program. If the program is to be audited as a major program based upon this HHS awarding agency request, and the HHS awarding agency agrees to pay the full incremental costs, then the auditee must have the program audited as a major program. A pass-through entity may use the provisions of this paragraph for a subrecipient.</P>

                <P>(a) A state, local government, or Indian tribe that is required by constitution or statute, in effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo its audits less frequently than annually, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially. This requirement must still be in effect for the biennial period.</P>
                <P>(b) Any nonprofit organization that had biennial audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially.</P>

A listing of current program-specific audit guides can be found in the compliance supplement beginning with the 2014 supplement including HHS awarding agency contact information and a Web site where a copy of the guide can be obtained. When a current program-specific audit guide is available, the auditor must follow GAGAS and the guide when performing a program-specific audit.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Program-specific audit guide not available.</E> (1) When a current program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor must have basically the same responsibilities for the Federal program as they would have for an audit of a major program in a single audit.</P>
                <P>(2) The auditee must prepare the financial statement(s) for the Federal program that includes, at a minimum, a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the program and notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, a summary schedule of prior audit findings consistent with the requirements of § 75.511(b), and a corrective action plan consistent with the requirements of § 75.511(c).</P>
                <P>(3) The auditor must:</P>
                <P>(i) Perform an audit of the financial statement(s) for the Federal program in accordance with GAGAS;</P>
                <P>(ii) Obtain an understanding of internal controls and perform tests of internal controls over the Federal program consistent with the requirements of § 75.514(c) for a major program;</P>
                <P>(iii) Perform procedures to determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program consistent with the requirements of § 75.514(d) for a major program;</P>
                <P>(iv) Follow up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with the requirements of § 75.511, and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding; and</P>
                <P>(v) Report any audit findings consistent with the requirements of § 75.516.</P>
                <P>(4) The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:</P>

When procuring audit services, the objective is to obtain high-quality audits. In requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit must be made clear and the non-Federal entity must request a copy of the audit organization's peer review report which the auditor is required to provide under GAGAS. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of peer and external quality control reviews, and price. Whenever possible, the auditee must make positive efforts to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, in procuring audit services as stated in § 75.330, or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable.<PRTPAGE P="338"/>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Financial statements.</E> The auditee must prepare financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements must be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year that is chosen to meet the requirements of this part. However, non-Federal entity-wide financial statements may also include departments, agencies, and other organizational units that have separate audits in accordance with § 75.514(a) and prepare separate financial statements.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards.</E> The auditee must also prepare a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the period covered by the auditee's financial statements which must include the total Federal awards expended as determined in accordance with § 75.502. While not required, the auditee may choose to provide information requested by HHS awarding agencies and pass-through entities to make the schedule easier to use. For example, when a Federal program has multiple Federal award years, the auditee may list the amount of Federal awards expended for each Federal award year separately. At a minimum, the schedule must:</P>
                <P>(1) List individual Federal programs by Federal agency. For a cluster of programs, provide the cluster name, list individual Federal programs within the cluster of programs, and provide the applicable Federal agency name. For R&amp;D, total Federal awards expended must be shown either by individual Federal award or by Federal agency and major subdivision within the Federal agency. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision in the Department of Health and Human Services.</P>
                <P>(2) For Federal awards received as a subrecipient, the name of the pass-through entity and identifying number assigned by the pass-through entity must be included.</P>
                <P>(3) Provide total Federal awards expended for each individual Federal program and the CFDA number or other identifying number when the CFDA information is not available. For a cluster of programs also provide the total for the cluster.</P>

                <P>(5) For loan or loan guarantee programs described in § 75.502(b), identify in the notes to the schedule the balances outstanding at the end of the audit period. This is in addition to including the total Federal awards expended for loan or loan guarantee programs in the schedule.</P>
                <P>(6) Include notes that describe that significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, and note whether or not the auditee elected to use the 10% de minimis cost rate as covered in § 75.414.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee must prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee must also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan must include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under § 75.516(c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it must include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred. The corrective action plan and summary schedule of prior audit findings must <PRTPAGE P="339"/>include findings relating to the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Summary schedule of prior audit findings.</E> The summary schedule of prior audit findings must report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs. The summary schedule must also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.</P>
                <P>(2) When audit findings were not corrected or were only partially corrected, the summary schedule must describe the reasons for the finding's recurrence and planned corrective action, and any partial corrective action taken. When corrective action taken is significantly different from corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or in the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule must provide an explanation.</P>
                <P>(3) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position must be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:</P>
                <P>(i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to the FAC;</P>
                <P>(ii) The Federal agency or pass-through entity is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and</P>
                <P>(iii) A management decision was not issued.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Corrective action plan.</E> At the completion of the audit, the auditee must prepare, in a document separate from the auditor's findings described in § 75.516, a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the current year auditor's reports. The corrective action plan must provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for corrective action, the corrective action planned, and the anticipated completion date. If the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, then the corrective action plan must include an explanation and specific reasons.</P>

If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the reporting package is due the next business day.</P>
                <P>(2) Unless restricted by Federal statutes or regulations, the auditee must make copies available for public inspection. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable information.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Data collection.</E> The FAC is the repository of record for subpart F of this part reporting packages and the data collection form. All Federal agencies, pass-through entities and others interested in a reporting package and data collection form must obtain it by accessing the FAC.</P>

                <P>(1) The auditee must submit required data elements described in appendix X to part 75, which state whether the audit was completed in accordance with this part and provides information about the auditee, its Federal programs, and the results of the audit. The data must include information available from the audit required by this part that is necessary for Federal agencies to use the audit to ensure integrity for Federal programs. The data elements and format must be approved by OMB, available from the FAC, and include collections of information from the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section. A senior level representative of the auditee (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                  <PRTPAGE P="340"/>state controller, director of finance, chief executive officer, or chief financial officer) must sign a statement to be included as part of the data collection that says that the auditee complied with the requirements of this part, the data were prepared in accordance with this part (and the instructions accompanying the form), the reporting package does not include protected personally identifiable information, the information included in its entirety is accurate and complete, and that the FAC is authorized to make the reporting package and the form publicly available on a Web site.</P>

If this option is exercised, the auditee becomes responsible for submitting the reporting package directly to any pass-through entities through which it has received a Federal award and to pass-through entities for which the summary schedule of prior audit findings reported the status of any findings related to Federal awards that the pass-through entity provided. Unless restricted by Federal statute or regulation, if the auditee opts not to authorize publication, it must make copies of the reporting package available for public inspection.</P>
                <P>(3) Using the information included in the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section, the auditor must complete the applicable data elements of the data collection form. The auditor must sign a statement to be included as part of the data collection form that indicates, at a minimum, the source of the information included in the form, the auditor's responsibility for the information, that the form is not a substitute for the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section, and that the content of the form is limited to the collection of information prescribed by OMB.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Reporting package.</E> The reporting package must include the:</P>

                <P>(e) <E T="03">Requests for management letters issued by the auditor.</E> In response to requests by a Federal agency or pass-through entity, auditees must submit a copy of any management letters issued by the auditor.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Report retention requirements.</E> Auditees must keep one copy of the data collection form described in paragraph (b) of this section and one copy of the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section on file for three years from the date of submission to the FAC.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Responsibilities.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a)(1) Cognizant agency for audit responsibilities. A non-Federal entity expending more than $50 million a year in Federal awards must have a cognizant agency for audit. The designated cognizant agency for audit must be the Federal awarding agency that provides <PRTPAGE P="341"/>the predominant amount of direct funding to a non-Federal entity unless OMB designates a specific cognizant agency for audit.</P>
                <P>(2) To provide for continuity of cognizance, the determination of the predominant amount of direct funding must be based upon direct Federal awards expended in the non-Federal entity's fiscal years ending in 2009, 2014, 2019 and every fifth year thereafter. For example, audit cognizance for periods ending in 2011 through 2015 will be determined based on Federal awards expended in 2009.</P>
                <P>(3) Notwithstanding the manner in which audit cognizance is determined, a Federal awarding agency with cognizance for an auditee may reassign cognizance to another Federal awarding agency that provides substantial funding and agrees to be the cognizant agency for audit. Within 30 calendar days after any reassignment, both the old and the new cognizant agency for audit must provide notice of the change to the FAC, the auditee, and, if known, the auditor. The cognizant agency for audit must:</P>
                <P>(i) Provide technical audit advice and liaison assistance to auditees and auditors.</P>
                <P>(ii) Obtain or conduct quality control reviews on selected audits made by non-Federal auditors, and provide the results to other interested organizations. Cooperate and provide support to the Federal agency designated by OMB to lead a government-wide project to determine the quality of single audits by providing a statistically reliable estimate of the extent that single audits conform to applicable requirements, standards, and procedures; and to make recommendations to address noted audit quality issues, including recommendations for any changes to applicable requirements, standards and procedures indicated by the results of the project. This government-wide audit quality project must be performed once every 6 years beginning in 2018 or at such other interval as determined by OMB, and the results must be public.</P>
                <P>(iii) Promptly inform other affected Federal agencies and appropriate Federal law enforcement officials of any direct reporting by the auditee or its auditor required by GAGAS or statutes and regulations.</P>
                <P>(iv) Advise the community of independent auditors of any noteworthy or important factual trends related to the quality of audits stemming from quality control reviews. Significant problems or quality issues consistently identified through quality control reviews of audit reports must be referred to appropriate state licensing agencies and professional bodies.</P>
                <P>(v) Advise the auditor, HHS awarding agencies, and, where appropriate, the auditee of any deficiencies found in the audits when the deficiencies require corrective action by the auditor. When advised of deficiencies, the auditee must work with the auditor to take corrective action. If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency for audit must notify the auditor, the auditee, and applicable HHS awarding agencies and pass-through entities of the facts and make recommendations for follow-up action. Major inadequacies or repetitive substandard performance by auditors must be referred to appropriate state licensing agencies and professional bodies for disciplinary action.</P>
                <P>(vi) Coordinate, to the extent practical, audits or reviews made by or for Federal agencies that are in addition to the audits made pursuant to this part, so that the additional audits or reviews build upon rather than duplicate audits performed in accordance with this part.</P>

                <P>(vii) Coordinate a management decision for cross-cutting audit findings (as defined in § 75.2 <E T="03">Cross-cutting audit finding</E>) that affect the Federal programs of more than one agency when requested by any Federal awarding agency whose awards are included in the audit finding of the auditee.</P>
                <P>(viii) Coordinate the audit work and reporting responsibilities among auditors to achieve the most cost-effective audit.</P>
                <P>(ix) Provide advice to auditees as to how to handle changes in fiscal years.</P>

                <P>(b) Oversight agency for audit responsibilities. An auditee who does not have a designated cognizant agency for audit will be under the general oversight of the Federal agency determined <PRTPAGE P="342"/>in accordance with § 75.2 <E T="03">Oversight agency for audit.</E> A Federal agency with oversight for an auditee may reassign oversight to another Federal agency that agrees to be the oversight agency for audit. Within 30 calendar days after any reassignment, both the old and the new oversight agency for audit must provide notice of the change to the FAC, the auditee, and, if known, the auditor. The oversight agency for audit:</P>
                <P>(1) Must provide technical advice to auditees and auditors as requested.</P>
                <P>(2) May assume all or some of the responsibilities normally performed by a cognizant agency for audit.</P>
                <P>(c) HHS awarding agency responsibilities. The HHS awarding agency must perform the following for the Federal awards it makes (See also the requirements of § 75.210):</P>
                <P>(1) Ensure that audits are completed and reports are received in a timely manner and in accordance with the requirements of this part.</P>
                <P>(2) Provide technical advice and counsel to auditees and auditors as requested.</P>
                <P>(3) Follow-up on audit findings to ensure that the recipient takes appropriate and timely corrective action. As part of audit follow-up, the HHS awarding agency must:</P>
                <P>(i) Issue a management decision as prescribed in § 75.521;</P>
                <P>(ii) Monitor the recipient taking appropriate and timely corrective action;</P>

                <P>(iii) Use cooperative audit resolution mechanisms (see § 75.2 <E T="03">Cooperative audit resolution</E>) to improve Federal program outcomes through better audit resolution, follow-up, and corrective action; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Develop a baseline, metrics, and targets to track, over time, the effectiveness of the Federal agency's process to follow-up on audit findings and on the effectiveness of Single Audits in improving non-Federal entity accountability and their use by HHS awarding agencies in making award decisions.</P>
                <P>(4) Provide OMB annual updates to the compliance supplement and work with OMB to ensure that the compliance supplement focuses the auditor to test the compliance requirements most likely to cause improper payments, fraud, waste, abuse or generate audit finding for which the Federal awarding agency will take sanctions.</P>
                <P>(5) Provide OMB with the name of a single audit accountable official from among the senior policy officials of the HHS awarding agency who must be:</P>
                <P>(i) Responsible for ensuring that the agency fulfills all the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and effectively uses the single audit process to reduce improper payments and improve Federal program outcomes.</P>
                <P>(ii) Held accountable to improve the effectiveness of the single audit process based upon metrics as described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) Responsible for designating the Federal agency's key management single audit liaison.</P>
                <P>(6) Provide OMB with the name of a key management single audit liaison who must:</P>
                <P>(i) Serve as the Federal awarding agency's management point of contact for the single audit process both within and outside the Federal Government.</P>
                <P>(ii) Promote interagency coordination, consistency, and sharing in areas such as coordinating audit follow-up; identifying higher-risk non-Federal entities; providing input on single audit and follow-up policy; enhancing the utility of the FAC; and studying ways to use single audit results to improve Federal award accountability and best practices.</P>
                <P>(iii) Oversee training for the HHS awarding agency's program management personnel related to the single audit process.</P>
                <P>(iv) Promote the HHS awarding agency's use of cooperative audit resolution mechanisms.</P>
                <P>(v) Coordinate the HHS awarding agency's activities to ensure appropriate and timely follow-up and corrective action on audit findings.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Scope of audit.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The audit must be conducted in accordance with GAGAS. The audit must cover the entire operations of the auditee, or, at the option of the auditee, such audit must include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units that expended or otherwise administered Federal awards during such audit period, provided that each such audit must encompass the financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for each such department, agency, and other organizational unit, which must be considered to be a non-Federal entity. The financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards must be for the same audit period.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Financial statements.</E> The auditor must determine whether the financial statements of the auditee are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The auditor must also determine whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Internal control.</E> (1) The compliance supplement provides guidance on internal controls over Federal programs based upon the guidance in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Internal Control—Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).</P>
                <P>(2) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over Federal programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk of noncompliance for major programs.</P>
                <P>(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the auditor must:</P>
                <P>(i) Plan the testing of internal control over compliance for major programs to support a low assessed level of control risk for the assertions relevant to the compliance requirements for each major program; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements for a major program are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor must report a significant deficiency or material weakness in accordance with § 75.516, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Compliance.</E> (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that may have a direct and material effect on each of its major programs.</P>
                <P>(2) The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal programs and the compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplement.</P>
                <P>(3) For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplement, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplement, the auditor must determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplement, the auditor must follow the compliance supplement's guidance for programs not included in the supplement.</P>

                <P>(4) The compliance testing must include tests of transactions and such other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an opinion on compliance.<PRTPAGE P="344"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Audit follow-up.</E> The auditor must follow-up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 75.511(b), and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding. The auditor must perform audit follow-up procedures regardless of whether a prior audit finding relates to a major program in the current year.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Data collection form.</E> As required in § 75.512(b)(3), the auditor must complete and sign specified sections of the data collection form.</P>

                <P>The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:</P>
                <P>(a) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements as a whole.</P>
                <P>(b) A report on internal control over financial reporting and compliance with provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and award agreements, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements. This report must describe the scope of testing of internal control and compliance and the results of the tests, and, where applicable, it will refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) A report on compliance for each major program and a report on internal control over compliance. This report must describe the scope of testing of internal control over compliance, include an opinion or disclaimer of opinion as to whether the auditee complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards which could have a direct and material effect on each major program and refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

                <P>(vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any audit findings that the auditor is required to report under § 75.516(a);</P>
                <P>(vii) An identification of major programs by listing each individual major program; however in the case of a cluster of programs only the cluster name as shown on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards is required;</P>
                <P>(viii) The dollar threshold used to distinguish between Type A and Type B programs, as described in § 75.518(b)(1), or (b)(3) when a recalculation of the Type A threshold is required for large loan or loan guarantees; and</P>

                <SUBJECT>Audit findings.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Audit findings reported.</E> The auditor must report the following as audit findings in a schedule of findings and questioned costs:</P>
                <P>(1) Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over major programs and significant instances of abuse relating to major programs. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a significant deficiency or material weakness for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the Compliance Supplement.</P>
                <P>(2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether a noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement.</P>
                <P>(3) Known questioned costs that are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. Known questioned costs are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the best estimate of total costs questioned (likely questioned costs), not just the questioned costs specifically identified (known questioned costs). The auditor must also report known questioned costs when likely questioned costs are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. In reporting questioned costs, the auditor must include information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.</P>

                <P>(4) Known questioned costs that are greater than $25,000 for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required under this part to perform audit procedures for such a Federal program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program that is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a Federal program that is not audited as a major program (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $25,000, then the auditor must report this as an audit finding.</P>
                <P>(5) The circumstances concerning why the auditor's report on compliance for each major program is other than an unmodified opinion, unless such circumstances are otherwise reported as audit findings in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards.</P>

                <P>(6) Known or likely fraud affecting a Federal award, unless such fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards. This paragraph does not require the auditor to report publicly information which could compromise investigative or <PRTPAGE P="346"/>legal proceedings or to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.</P>
                <P>(7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 75.511(b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Audit finding detail and clarity.</E> Audit findings must be presented in sufficient detail and clarity for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action, and for Federal agencies and pass-through entities to arrive at a management decision. The following specific information must be included, as applicable, in audit findings:</P>
                <P>(1) Federal program and specific Federal award identification including the CFDA title and number, Federal award identification number and year, name of Federal agency, and name of the applicable pass-through entity. When information, such as the CFDA title and number or Federal award identification number, is not available, the auditor must provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.</P>
                <P>(2) The criteria or specific requirement upon which the audit finding is based, including the Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awards. Criteria generally identify the required or desired state or expectation with respect to the program or operation. Criteria provide a context for evaluating evidence and understanding findings.</P>
                <P>(3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.</P>
                <P>(4) A statement of cause that identifies the reason or explanation for the condition or the factors responsible for the difference between the situation that exists (condition) and the required or desired state (criteria), which may also serve as a basis for recommendations for corrective action.</P>
                <P>(5) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action. A statement of the effect or potential effect should provide a clear, logical link to establish the impact or potential impact of the difference between the condition and the criteria.</P>
                <P>(6) Identification of questioned costs and how they were computed. Known questioned costs must be identified by applicable CFDA number(s) and applicable Federal award identification number(s).</P>
                <P>(7) Information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the audit findings, such as whether the audit findings represent an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified must be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value. The auditor should report whether the sampling was a statistically valid sample.</P>
                <P>(8) Identification of whether the audit finding was a repeat of a finding in the immediately prior audit and if so any applicable prior year audit finding numbers.</P>
                <P>(9) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.</P>
                <P>(10) Views of responsible officials of the auditee.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Reference numbers.</E> Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs must include a reference number in the format meeting the requirements of the data collection form submission required by § 75.512(b) to allow for easy referencing of the audit findings during follow-up.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Retention of audit documentation.</E> The auditor must retain audit documentation and reports for a minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee, unless the auditor is notified in writing by the cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, cognizant agency for indirect costs, or pass-through entity to extend the retention period. When the auditor is aware that the Federal agency, pass-<PRTPAGE P="347"/>through entity, or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor must contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to destruction of the audit documentation and reports.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Access to audit documentation.</E> Audit documentation must be made available upon request to the cognizant or oversight agency for audit or its designee, cognizant agency for indirect cost, a Federal agency, or GAO at the completion of the audit, as part of a quality review, to resolve audit findings, or to carry out oversight responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this part.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The auditor must use a risk-based approach to determine which Federal programs are major programs. This risk-based approach must include consideration of: Current and prior audit experience, oversight by Federal agencies and pass-through entities, and the inherent risk of the Federal this program.

                <P>(2) Federal programs not labeled Type A under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be labeled Type B programs.</P>
                <P>(3) The inclusion of large loan and loan guarantees (loans) must not result in the exclusion of other programs as Type A programs. When a Federal program providing loans exceeds four times the largest non-loan program it is considered a large loan program, and the auditor must consider this Federal program as a Type A program and exclude its values in determining other Type A programs. This recalculation of the Type A program is performed after removing the total of all large loan programs. For the purposes of this paragraph a program is only considered to be a Federal program providing loans if the value of Federal awards expended for loans within the program comprises fifty percent or more of the total Federal awards expended for the program. A cluster of programs is treated as one program and the value of Federal awards expended under a loan program is determined as described in § 75.502.</P>
                <P>(4) For biennial audits permitted under § 75.504, the determination of Type A and Type B programs must be based upon the Federal awards expended during the two-year period.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Step two.</E> (1) The auditor must identify Type A programs which are low-risk. In making this determination, the auditor must consider whether the requirements in § 75.519(c), the results of audit follow-up, or any changes in personnel or systems affecting the program indicate significantly increased risk and preclude the program from being low risk. For a Type A program to be considered low-risk, it must have been audited as a major program in at least one of the two most recent audit periods (in the most recent audit period in the case of a biennial audit), and, in the most recent audit period, the program must have not had:</P>

                <P>(i) Internal control deficiencies which were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on <PRTPAGE P="348"/>internal control for major programs as required under § 75.515(c);</P>
                <P>(ii) A modified opinion on the program in the auditor's report on major programs as required under § 75.515(c); or</P>
                <P>(iii) Known or likely questioned costs that exceed five percent of the total Federal awards expended for the program.</P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, OMB may approve an HHS awarding agency's request that a Type A program may not be considered low risk for a certain recipient. For example, it may be necessary for a large Type A program to be audited as a major program each year at a particular recipient to allow the HHS awarding agency to comply with 31 U.S.C. 3515. The HHS awarding agency must notify the recipient and, if known, the auditor of OMB's approval at least 180 calendar days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Step three.</E> (1) The auditor must identify Type B programs which are high-risk using professional judgment and the criteria in § 75.519. However, the auditor is not required to identify more high-risk Type B programs than at least one fourth the number of low-risk Type A programs identified as low-risk under Step 2 (paragraph (c) of this section). Except for known material weakness in internal control or compliance problems as discussed in § 75.519(b)(1), (b)(2), and (c)(1), a single criteria in risk would seldom cause a Type B program to be considered high-risk. When identifying which Type B programs to risk assess, the auditor is encouraged to use an approach which provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major over a period of time.</P>
                <P>(2) The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on relatively small Federal programs. Therefore, the auditor is only required to perform risk assessments on Type B programs that exceed twenty-five percent (0.25) of the Type A threshold determined in Step 1 (paragraph (b) of this section).</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Step four.</E> At a minimum, the auditor must audit all of the following as major programs:</P>
                <P>(1) All Type A programs not identified as low risk under step two (paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</P>
                <P>(2) All Type B programs identified as high-risk under step three (paragraph (d) of this section).</P>
                <P>(3) Such additional programs as may be necessary to comply with the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. This may require the auditor to audit more programs as major programs than the number of Type A programs.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Percentage of coverage rule.</E> If the auditee meets the criteria in § 75.520, the auditor need only audit the major programs identified in Step 4 (paragraph (e)(1) and (2) of this section) and such additional Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in aggregate, all major programs encompass at least 20 percent (0.20) of total Federal awards expended. Otherwise, the auditor must audit the major programs identified in Step 4 (paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section) and such additional Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in aggregate, all major programs encompass at least 40 percent (0.40) of total Federal awards expended.</P>

                <P>(h) <E T="03">Auditor's judgment.</E> When the major program determination was performed and documented in accordance with this subpart, the auditor's judgment in applying the risk-based approach to determine major programs must be presumed correct. Challenges by Federal agencies and pass-through entities must only be for clearly improper use of the requirements in this part. However, Federal agencies and pass-through entities may provide auditors guidance about the risk of a particular Federal program and the auditor must consider this guidance in determining major programs in audits not yet completed.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Criteria for Federal program risk.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of noncompliance occurring that could be material to the <PRTPAGE P="349"/>Federal program. The auditor must consider criteria, such as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular Federal program with auditee management and the Federal agency or pass-through entity.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Current and prior audit experience.</E> (1) Weaknesses in internal control over Federal programs would indicate higher risk. Consideration should be given to the control environment over Federal programs and such factors as the expectation of management's adherence to Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the Federal programs.</P>

                <P>(i) A Federal program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. When assessing risk in a large single audit, the auditor must consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.</P>
                <P>(ii) When significant parts of a Federal program are passed through to subrecipients, a weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk.</P>
                <P>(2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, particularly when the situations identified in the audit findings could have a significant impact on a Federal program or have not been corrected.</P>
                <P>(3) Federal programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than Federal programs recently audited as major programs without audit findings.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Oversight exercised by Federal agencies and pass-through entities.</E> (1) Oversight exercised by Federal agencies or pass-through entities could be used to assess risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity that disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk, whereas monitoring that disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.</P>
                <P>(2) Federal agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, may identify Federal programs that are higher risk. OMB will provide this identification in the compliance supplement.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Inherent risk of the Federal program.</E> (1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be of higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may have high risk for noncompliance with requirements of § 75.430, but otherwise be at low risk.</P>
                <P>(2) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards may increase risk.</P>
                <P>(3) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.</P>
                <P>(4) Type B programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Criteria for a low-risk auditee.</SUBJECT>
                <P>An auditee that meets all of the following conditions for each of the preceding two audit periods must qualify as a low-risk auditee and be eligible for reduced audit coverage in accordance with § 75.518.</P>
                <P>(a) Single audits were performed on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, including submitting the data collection form and the reporting package to the FAC within the timeframe specified in § 75.512 . A non-Federal entity that has biennial audits does not qualify as a low-risk auditee.</P>

                <P>(b) The auditor's opinion on whether the financial statements were prepared <PRTPAGE P="350"/>in accordance with GAAP, or a basis of accounting required by state law, and the auditor's in relation to opinion on the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards were unmodified.</P>
                <P>(c) There were no deficiencies in internal control which were identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of GAGAS.</P>
                <P>(d) The auditor did not report a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern.</P>
                <P>(e) None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two audit periods in which they were classified as Type A programs:</P>
                <P>(1) Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control for major programs as required under § 75.515(c);</P>
                <P>(2) A modified opinion on a major program in the auditor's report on major programs as required under § 75.515(c); or</P>
                <P>(3) Known or likely questioned costs that exceeded five percent of the total Federal awards expended for a Type A program during the audit period.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Management decision.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The management decision must clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments, or take other action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee. While not required, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may also issue a management decision on findings relating to the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal agency.</E> As provided in § 75.513(a)(3)(vii), the cognizant agency for audit must be responsible for coordinating a management decision for audit findings that affect the programs of more than one Federal agency. As provided in § 75.513(c)(3), a Federal awarding agency is responsible for issuing a management decision for findings that relate to Federal awards it makes to non-Federal entities.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Pass-through entity.</E> As provided in § 75.352(d), the pass-through entity must be responsible for issuing a management decision for audit findings that relate to Federal awards it makes to subrecipients.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Time requirements.</E> The HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity responsible for issuing a management decision must do so within six months of acceptance of the audit report by the FAC. The auditee must initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible and corrective action should begin no later than upon receipt of the audit report.</P>

            <APPENDIX>
              <EAR>Pt. 75, App. I</EAR>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix I to Part 75—Full Text of Notice of Funding Opportunity</HD>
              <P>The full text of the notice of funding opportunity is organized in sections. The required format outlined in this appendix indicates immediately following the title of each section whether that section is required in every announcement or is an HHS awarding agency option. The format is designed so that similar types of information will appear in the same sections in announcements of different Federal funding opportunities. Toward that end, there is text in each of the following sections to describe the types of information that an HHS awarding agency would include in that section of an actual announcement.</P>

              <P>An HHS awarding agency that wishes to include information that the format does not specifically discuss may address that subject in whatever section(s) is most appropriate. For example, if an HHS awarding agency chooses to address performance goals in the announcement, it might do so in the funding opportunity description, the application content, or the reporting requirements.<PRTPAGE P="351"/>
              </P>
              <P>Similarly, when this format calls for a type of information to be in a particular section, an HHS awarding agency wishing to address that subject in other sections may elect to repeat the information in those sections or use cross references between the sections (there should be hyperlinks for cross-references in any electronic versions of the announcement). For example, an HHS awarding agency may want to include in Section A information about the types of non-Federal entities who are eligible to apply. The format specifies a standard location for that information in Section C.1 but that does not preclude repeating the information in Section I or creating a cross reference between Sections A and C.1, as long as a potential applicant can find the information quickly and easily from the standard location.</P>
              <P>The sections of the full text of the announcement are described in the following paragraphs.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. Program Description—Required</HD>

              <P>This section contains the full program description of the funding opportunity. It may be as long as needed to adequately communicate to potential applicants the areas in which funding may be provided. It describes the HHS awarding agency's funding priorities or the technical or focus areas in which the HHS awarding agency intends to provide assistance. As appropriate, it may include any program history (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> whether this is a new program or a new or changed area of program emphasis). This section may communicate indicators of successful projects (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if the program encourages collaborative efforts) and may include examples of projects that have been funded previously. This section also may include other information the HHS awarding agency deems necessary, and must at a minimum include citations for authorizing statutes and regulations for the funding opportunity.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. Federal Award Information—Required</HD>
              <P>This section provides sufficient information to help an applicant make an informed decision about whether to submit a proposal. Relevant information could include the total amount of funding that the HHS awarding agency expects to award through the announcement; the anticipated number of Federal awards; the expected amounts of individual Federal awards (which may be a range); the amount of funding per Federal award, on average, experienced in previous years; and the anticipated start dates and periods of performance for new Federal awards. This section also should address whether applications for renewal or supplementation of existing projects are eligible to compete with applications for new Federal awards.</P>

              <P>This section also must indicate the type(s) of assistance instrument (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> grant, cooperative agreement) that may be awarded if applications are successful. If cooperative agreements may be awarded, this section either should describe the “substantial involvement” that the HHS awarding agency expects to have or should reference where the potential applicant can find that information (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> in the funding opportunity description in section A. or Federal award administration information in Section D. If procurement contracts also may be awarded, this must be stated.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">C. Eligibility Information</HD>
              <P>This section addresses the considerations or factors that determine applicant or application eligibility. This includes the eligibility of particular types of applicant organizations, any factors affecting the eligibility of the principal investigator or project director, and any criteria that make particular projects ineligible. HHS agencies should make clear whether an applicant's failure to meet an eligibility criterion by the time of an application deadline will result in the HHS awarding agency returning the application without review or, even though an application may be reviewed, will preclude the HHS awarding agency from making a Federal award. Key elements to be addressed are:</P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Eligible Applicants—Required.</E> Announcements must clearly identify the types of entities that are eligible to apply. If there are no restrictions on eligibility, this section may simply indicate that all potential applicants are eligible. If there are restrictions on eligibility, it is important to be clear about the specific types of entities that are eligible, not just the types that are ineligible. For example, if the program is limited to nonprofit organizations subject to 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) of the tax code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)), the announcement should say so. Similarly, it is better to state explicitly that Native American tribal organizations are eligible than to assume that they can unambiguously infer that from a statement that nonprofit organizations may apply. Eligibility also can be expressed by exception, (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> open to all types of domestic applicants other than individuals). This section should refer to any portion of Section D. specifying documentation that must be submitted to support an eligibility determination (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> proof of 501(c)(3) status as determined by the Internal Revenue Service or an authorizing tribal resolution). To the extent that any funding restriction in Section D.6 could affect the eligibility of an applicant or project, the announcement must either restate that restriction in this section or provide a cross-reference to its description in Section D.6.<PRTPAGE P="352"/>
              </P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Cost Sharing or Matching—Required.</E> Announcements must state whether there is required cost sharing, matching, or cost participation without which an application would be ineligible (if cost sharing is not required, the announcement must explicitly say so). Required cost sharing may be a certain percentage or amount, or may be in the form of contributions of specified items or activities (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> provision of equipment). It is important that the announcement be clear about any restrictions on the types of cost (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> in-kind contributions) that are acceptable as cost sharing. Cost sharing as an eligibility criterion includes requirements based in statute or regulation, as described in § 75.306. This section should refer to the appropriate portion(s) of section D. stating any pre-award requirements for submission of letters or other documentation to verify commitments to meet cost-sharing requirements if a Federal award is made.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Other—Required, if applicable.</E> If there are other eligibility criteria (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> criteria that have the effect of making an application or project ineligible for Federal awards, whether referred to as “responsiveness” criteria, “go-no go” criteria, “threshold” criteria, or in other ways), must be clearly stated and must include a reference to the regulation of requirement that describes the restriction, as applicable. For example, if entities that have been found to be in violation of a particular Federal statute are ineligible, it is important to say so. This section must also state any limit on the number of applications an applicant may submit under the announcement and make clear whether the limitation is on the submitting organization, individual investigator/program director, or both. This section should also address any eligibility criteria for beneficiaries or for program participants other than Federal award recipients.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">D. Application and Submission Information</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Address to Request Application Package—Required.</E> Potential applicants must be told how to get application forms, kits, or other materials needed to apply (if this announcement contains everything needed, this section need only say so). An Internet address where the materials can be accessed is acceptable. However, since high-speed Internet access is not yet universally available for downloading documents, and applicants may have additional accessibility requirements, there also should be a way for potential applicants to request paper copies of materials, such as a U.S. Postal Service mailing address, telephone or FAX number, Telephone Device for the Deaf (TDD), Text Telephone (TTY) number, and/or Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) number.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Content and Form of Application Submission—Required.</E> This section must identify the required content of an application and the forms or formats that an applicant must use to submit it. If any requirements are stated elsewhere because they are general requirements that apply to multiple programs or funding opportunities, this section should refer to where those requirements may be found. This section also should include required forms or formats as part of the announcement or state where the applicant may obtain them.</P>
              <P>This section should specifically address content and form or format requirements for:</P>
              <P>i. Pre-applications, letters of intent, or white papers required or encouraged (see Section D.4), including any limitations on the number of pages or other formatting requirements similar to those for full applications.</P>
              <P>ii. The application as a whole. For all submissions, this would include any limitations on the number of pages, font size and typeface, margins, paper size, number of copies, and sequence or assembly requirements. If electronic submission is permitted or required, this could include special requirements for formatting or signatures.</P>
              <P>iii. Component pieces of the application (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if all copies of the application must bear original signatures on the face page or the program narrative may not exceed 10 pages). This includes any pieces that may be submitted separately by third parties (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> references or letters confirming commitments from third parties that will be contributing a portion of any required cost sharing).</P>
              <P>iv. Information that successful applicants must submit after notification of intent to make a Federal award, but prior to a Federal award. This could include evidence of compliance with requirements relating to human subjects or information needed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370h).</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Unique Entity Identifier and System for Award Management (SAM)—Required.</E>
              </P>
              <P>This paragraph must state clearly that each applicant (unless the applicant is an individual or Federal awarding agency that is excepted from those requirements under 2 CFR 25.110(b) or (c), or has an exception approved by the Federal awarding agency under 2 CFR 25.110(d)) is required to:</P>
              <P>(i) Be registered in SAM before submitting its application;</P>
              <P>(ii) provide a valid unique entity identifier in its application; and</P>
              <P>(iii) continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by a Federal awarding agency.</P>

              <P>It also must state that the Federal awarding agency may not make a Federal award to <PRTPAGE P="353"/>an applicant until the applicant has complied with all applicable unique entity identifier and SAM requirements and, if an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements by the time the Federal awarding agency is ready to make a Federal award, the Federal awarding agency may determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a Federal award and use that determination as a basis for making a Federal award to another applicant.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Submission Dates and Times—Required.</E> Announcements must identify due dates and times for all submissions. This includes not only the full applications but also any preliminary submissions (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> letters of intent, white papers, or pre-applications). It also includes any other submissions of information before Federal award that are separate from the full application. If the funding opportunity is a general announcement that is open for a period of time with no specific due dates for applications, this section should say so. Note that the information on dates that is included in this section also must appear with other overview information in a location preceding the full text of the announcement (see § 75.203).</P>
              <P>Each type of submission should be designated as encouraged or required and, if required, any deadline date (or dates, if the Federal awarding agency plans more than one cycle of application submission, review, and Federal award under the announcement) should be specified. The announcement must state (or provide a reference to another document that states):</P>
              <P>i. Any deadline in terms of a date and local time. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the reporting package is due the next business day.</P>
              <P>ii. What the deadline means (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> whether it is the date and time by which the Federal awarding agency must receive the application, the date by which the application must be postmarked, or something else) and how that depends, if at all, on the submission method (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mail, electronic, or personal/courier delivery).</P>
              <P>iii. The effect of missing a deadline (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> whether late applications are neither reviewed nor considered or are reviewed and considered under some circumstances).</P>
              <P>iv. How the receiving Federal office determines whether an application or pre-application has been submitted before the deadline. This includes the form of acceptable proof of mailing or system-generated documentation of receipt date and time.</P>
              <P>This section also may indicate whether, when, and in what form the applicant will receive an acknowledgement of receipt. This information should be displayed in ways that will be easy to understand and use. It can be difficult to extract all needed information from narrative paragraphs, even when they are well written. A tabular form for providing a summary of the information may help applicants for some programs and give them what effectively could be a checklist to verify the completeness of their application package before submission.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Intergovernmental Review—Required, if applicable.</E> If the funding opportunity is subject to Executive Order 12372, “Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,” the notice must say so. In alerting applicants that they must contact their state's Single Point of Contact (SPOC) to find out about and comply with the state's process under Executive Order 12372, it may be useful to inform potential applicants that the names and addresses of the SPOCs are listed in the Office of Management and Budget's Web site. <E T="03">www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/spoc.html</E>.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">Funding Restrictions—Required.</E> Notices must include information on funding restrictions in order to allow an applicant to develop an application and budget consistent with program requirements. Examples are whether construction is an allowable activity, if there are any limitations on direct costs such as foreign travel or equipment purchases, and if there are any limits on indirect costs (or facilities and administrative costs). Applicants must be advised if Federal awards will not allow reimbursement of pre-Federal award costs.</P>
              <P>7. <E T="03">Other Submission Requirements— Required.</E> This section must address any other submission requirements not included in the other paragraphs of this section. This might include the format of submission, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> paper or electronic, for each type of required submission. Applicants should not be required to submit in more than one format and this section should indicate whether they may choose whether to submit applications in hard copy or electronically, may submit only in hard copy, or may submit only electronically.</P>

              <P>This section also must indicate where applications (and any pre-applications) must be submitted if sent by postal mail, electronic means, or hand-delivery. For postal mail submission, this must include the name of an office, official, individual or function (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> application receipt center) and a complete mailing address. For electronic submission, this must include the URL or email address; whether a password(s) is required; whether particular software or other electronic capabilities are required; what to do in the event of system problems and a point of contact who will be available in the event the applicant experiences technical difficulties.<SU>1</SU>

              <P>
                <E T="03">1. Criteria—Required.</E> This section must address the criteria that the Federal awarding agency will use to evaluate applications. This includes the merit and other review criteria that evaluators will use to judge applications, including any statutory, regulatory, or other preferences (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> minority status or Native American tribal preferences) that will be applied in the review process. These criteria are distinct from eligibility criteria that are addressed before an application is accepted for review and any program policy or other factors that are applied during the selection process, after the review process is completed. The intent is to make the application process transparent so applicants can make informed decisions when preparing their applications to maximize fairness of the process. The announcement should clearly describe all criteria, including any sub-criteria. If criteria vary in importance, the announcement should specify the relative percentages, weights, or other means used to distinguish among them. For statutory, regulatory, or other preferences, the announcement should provide a detailed explanation of those preferences with an explicit indication of their effect (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> whether they result in additional points being assigned).</P>

              <P>If an applicant's proposed cost sharing will be considered in the review process (as opposed to being an eligibility criterion described in Section C.2), the announcement must specifically address how it will be considered (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> to assign a certain number of additional points to applicants who offer cost sharing, or to break ties among applications with equivalent scores after evaluation against all other factors). If cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation, the announcement should say so, so that there is no ambiguity for potential applicants. Vague statements that cost sharing is encouraged, without clarification as to what that means, are unhelpful to applicants. It also is important that the announcement be clear about any restrictions on the types of cost (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> in-kind contributions) that are acceptable as cost sharing.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">2. Review and Selection Process—Required.</E> This section may vary in the level of detail provided. The announcement must list any program policy or other factors or elements, other than merit criteria, that the selecting official may use in selecting applications for Federal award (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> geographical dispersion, program balance, or diversity). The HHS awarding agency may also include other appropriate details. For example, this section may indicate who is responsible for evaluation against the merit criteria (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> peers external to the HHS awarding agency or HHS awarding agency personnel) and/or who makes the final selections for Federal awards. If there is a multi-phase review process (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an external panel advising internal HHS awarding agency personnel who make final recommendations to the deciding official), the announcement may describe the phases. It also may include: the number of people on an evaluation panel and how it operates, the way reviewers are selected, reviewer qualifications, and the way that conflicts of interest are avoided. With respect to electronic methods for providing information about funding opportunities or accepting applicants' submissions of information, each HHS awarding agency is responsible for compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d).</P>
              <P>In addition, if the HHS awarding agency permits applicants to nominate suggested reviewers of their applications or suggest those they feel may be inappropriate due to a conflict of interest, that information should be included in this section.</P>

              <P>3. For any Federal award under a notice of funding opportunity, if the HHS awarding agency anticipates that the total Federal share will be greater than the simplified acquisition threshold on any Federal award under a notice of funding opportunity may include, over the period of performance (see § 75.2 <E T="03">Simplified Acquisition Threshold</E>), this section must also inform applicants:</P>
              <P>i. That the HHS awarding agency, prior to making a Federal award with a total amount of Federal share greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS) (see 41 U.S.C. 2313);</P>
              <P>ii. That an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through SAM and comment on any information about itself that the HHS awarding agency previously entered and is currently in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM;</P>
              <P>iii. That the HHS awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to the other information in the designated integrity and performance system, in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in § 75.205.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">4. Anticipated Announcement and Federal Award Dates—Optional.</E> This section is intended to provide applicants with information they can use for planning purposes. If there is a single application deadline followed by the simultaneous review of all applications, the HHS awarding agency can include in this section information about the <PRTPAGE P="355"/>anticipated dates for announcing or notifying successful and unsuccessful applicants and for having Federal awards in place. If applications are received and evaluated on a “rolling” basis at different times during an extended period, it may be appropriate to give applicants an estimate of the time needed to process an application and notify the applicant of the HHS awarding agency's decision.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">F. Federal Award Administration Information</HD>
              <P>
                <E T="03">1. Federal Award Notices—Required.</E> This section must address what a successful applicant can expect to receive following selection. If the HHS awarding agency's practice is to provide a separate notice stating that an application has been selected before it actually makes the Federal award, this section would be the place to indicate that the letter is not an authorization to begin performance (to the extent that it allows charging to Federal awards of pre-award costs at the non-Federal entity's own risk). This section should indicate that the notice of Federal award signed by the grants officer (or equivalent) is the authorizing document, and whether it is provided through postal mail or by electronic means and to whom. It also may address the timing, form, and content of notifications to unsuccessful applicants. See also § 75.210.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements—Required.</E> This section must identify the usual administrative and national policy requirements the HHS awarding agency's Federal awards may include. Providing this information lets a potential applicant identify any requirements with which it would have difficulty complying if its application is successful. In those cases, early notification about the requirements allows the potential applicant to decide not to apply or to take needed actions before receiving the Federal award. The announcement need not include all of the terms and conditions of the Federal-award, but may refer to a document (with information about how to obtain it) or Internet site where applicants can see the terms and conditions. If this funding opportunity will lead to Federal awards with some specific terms and conditions that differ from the HHS awarding agency's usual (sometimes called “general”) terms and conditions, this section should highlight those specific terms and conditions. Doing so will alert applicants that have received Federal awards from the HHS awarding agency previously and might not otherwise expect different terms and conditions. For the same reason, the announcement should inform potential applicants about special requirements that could apply to particular Federal awards after the review of applications and other information, based on the particular circumstances of the effort to be supported (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if human subjects were to be involved or if some situations may justify special terms on intellectual property, data sharing or security requirements).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">3. Reporting—Required.</E> This section must include general information about the type (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, financial or performance), frequency, and means of submission (paper or electronic) of post-Federal award reporting requirements. Highlight any special reporting requirements for Federal awards under this funding opportunity that differ (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, by report type, frequency, form/format, or circumstances for use) from what the HHS awarding agency's Federal awards usually require. HHS agencies must also describe in this section all relevant requirements such as those at 2 CFR 180.335 and 2 CFR 180.350. If the Federal share of any Federal award may include more than $500,000 over the period of performance, this section must inform potential applicants about the post award reporting requirements in Appendix XII.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">G. HHS Awarding Agency Contact(s)—Required</HD>
              <P>The announcement must give potential applicants a point(s) of contact for answering questions or helping with problems while the funding opportunity is open. The intent of this requirement is to be as helpful as possible to potential applicants, so the HHS awarding agency should consider approaches such as giving:</P>

              <P>1. Points of contact who may be reached in multiple ways (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> by telephone, FAX, and/or email, as well as regular mail).</P>
              <P>2. A fax or email address that multiple people access, so that someone will respond even if others are unexpectedly absent during critical periods.</P>
              <P>3. Different contacts for distinct kinds of help (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> one for questions of programmatic content and a second for administrative questions).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">H. Other Information—Optional</HD>
              <P>This section may include any additional information that will assist a potential applicant. For example, the section might:</P>
              <P>1. Indicate whether this is a new program or a one-time initiative.</P>
              <P>2. Mention related programs or other upcoming or ongoing HHS awarding agency funding opportunities for similar activities.</P>
              <P>3. Include current Internet addresses for the HHS awarding agency Web sites that may be useful to an applicant in understanding the program.</P>

              <P>4. Alert applicants to the need to identify proprietary information and inform them about the way the HHS awarding agency will handle it.<PRTPAGE P="356"/>
              </P>
              <P>5. Include certain routine notices to applicants (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> that the Federal Government is not obligated to make any Federal award as a result of the announcement or that only grants officers can bind the Federal Government to the expenditure of funds).</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix II to Part 75—Contract Provisions for Non-Federal Entity Contracts Under Federal Awards</HD>
              <P>In addition to other provisions required by the HHS agency or non-Federal entity, all contracts made by the non-Federal entity under the Federal award must contain provisions covering the following, as applicable.</P>
              <P>A. Contracts for more than the simplified acquisition threshold currently set at $150,000, which is the inflation adjusted amount determined by the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (Councils) as authorized by 41 U.S.C. 1908, must address administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as appropriate.</P>
              <P>B. All contracts in excess of $10,000 must address termination for cause and for convenience by the non-Federal entity including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement.</P>
              <P>C. Equal Employment Opportunity. Except as otherwise provided under 41 CFR part 60, all contracts that meet the definition of “federally assisted construction contract” in 41 CFR part 60-1.3 must include the equal opportunity clause provided under 41 CFR 60-1.4(b), in accordance with Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity (30 FR 12319, 12935, 3 CFR 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339) as amended by Executive Order 11375 amending Executive Order 11246 Relating to Equal Employment Opportunity, and implementing regulations at 41 CFR part 60.</P>
              <P>D. Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 3141-3148). When required by Federal program legislation, all prime construction contracts in excess of $2,000 awarded by non-Federal entities must include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141-3144, and 3146-3148) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). In accordance with the statute, contractors must be required to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than the prevailing wages specified in a wage determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors must be required to pay wages not less than once a week. The non-Federal entity must place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued by the Department of Labor in each solicitation. The decision to award a contract or subcontract must be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage determination. The non-Federal entity must report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal awarding agency. The contracts must also include a provision for compliance with the Copeland “Anti-Kickback” Act (40 U.S.C. 3145), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3). The Act provides that each contractor or subrecipient must be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the compensation to which he or she is otherwise entitled. The non-Federal entity must report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal awarding agency.</P>
              <P>E. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701-3708). Where applicable, all contracts awarded by the non-Federal entity in excess of $100,000 that involve the employment of mechanics or laborers must include a provision for compliance with 40 U.S.C. 3702 and 3704, as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under 40 U.S.C. 3702 of the Act, each contractor must be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than one and a half times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in the work week. The requirements of 40 U.S.C. 3704 are applicable to construction work and provide that no laborer or mechanic must be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of intelligence.</P>
              <P>F. Rights to Inventions Made Under a Contract or Agreement. If the Federal award meets the definition of “funding agreement” under 37 CFR 401.2 (a) and the recipient or subrecipient wishes to enter into a contract with a small business firm or nonprofit organization regarding the substitution of parties, assignment or performance of experimental, developmental, or research work under that “funding agreement,” the recipient or subrecipient must comply with the requirements of 37 CFR part 401 and any implementing regulations issued by the awarding agency.</P>

              <P>G. Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387), as amended—Contracts and subgrants of amounts in excess of $150,000 must contain a provision that requires the non-Federal award to agree to comply with <PRTPAGE P="357"/>all applicable standards, orders or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387). Violations must be reported to the Federal awarding agency and the Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</P>
              <P>H. Debarment and Suspension (Executive Orders 12549 and 12689)—A contract award (see 2 CFR 180.220) must not be made to parties listed on the government-wide exclusions in the System for Award Management (SAM), in accordance with the OMB guidelines at 2 CFR part 180 that implement Executive Orders 12549 (3 CFR part 1986 Comp., p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR part 1989 Comp., p. 235), “Debarment and Suspension.” SAM Exclusions contains the names of parties debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, as well as parties declared ineligible under statutory or regulatory authority other than Executive Order 12549.</P>
              <P>I. Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352)—Contractors that apply or bid for an award exceeding $100,000 must file the required certification. Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 U.S.C. 1352. Each tier must also disclose any lobbying with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the non-Federal award.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix III to Part 75—Indirect (F&amp;A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs)</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. General</HD>
              <P>This appendix provides criteria for identifying and computing indirect (or indirect (F&amp;A)) rates at IHEs (institutions). Indirect (F&amp;A) costs are those that are incurred for common or joint objectives and therefore cannot be identified readily and specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other institutional activity. See subsection B.1, for a discussion of the components of indirect (F&amp;A) costs.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Major Functions of an Institution</HD>
              <P>Refers to instruction, organized research, other sponsored activities and other institutional activities as defined in this section:</P>
              <P>a. <E T="03">Instruction</E> means the teaching and training activities of an institution. Except for research training as provided in subsection b, this term includes all teaching and training activities, whether they are offered for credits toward a degree or certificate or on a non-credit basis, and whether they are offered through regular academic departments or separate divisions, such as a summer school division or an extension division. Also considered part of this major function are departmental research, and, where agreed to, university research.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sponsored instruction and training</E> means specific instructional or training activity established by grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. For purposes of the cost principles, this activity may be considered a major function even though an institution's accounting treatment may include it in the instruction function.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Departmental research</E> means research, development and scholarly activities that are not organized research and, consequently, are not separately budgeted and accounted for. Departmental research, for purposes of this document, is not considered as a major function, but as a part of the instruction function of the institution.</P>
              <P>(3) Only mandatory cost sharing or cost sharing specifically committed in the project budget must be included in the organized research base for computing the indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate or reflected in any allocation of indirect costs. Salary costs above statutory limits are not considered cost sharing.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Organized research</E> means all research and development activities of an institution that are separately budgeted and accounted for. It includes:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sponsored research</E> means all research and development activities that are sponsored by Federal and non-Federal agencies and organizations. This term includes activities involving the training of individuals in research techniques (commonly called research training) where such activities utilize the same facilities as other research and development activities and where such activities are not included in the instruction function.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">University research</E> means all research and development activities that are separately budgeted and accounted for by the institution under an internal application of institutional funds. University research, for purposes of this document, must be combined with sponsored research under the function of organized research.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Other sponsored activities</E> means programs and projects financed by Federal and non-<PRTPAGE P="358"/>Federal agencies and organizations which involve the performance of work other than instruction and organized research. Examples of such programs and projects are health service projects and community service programs. However, when any of these activities are undertaken by the institution without outside support, they may be classified as other institutional activities.</P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">Other institutional activitie</E>s means all activities of an institution except for instruction, departmental research, organized research, and other sponsored activities, as defined in this section; indirect (F&amp;A) cost activities identified in this Appendix paragraph B, Identification and assignment of indirect (F&amp;A) costs; and specialized services facilities described in § 75.468 of this part.</P>
              <P>Examples of other institutional activities include operation of residence halls, dining halls, hospitals and clinics, student unions, intercollegiate athletics, bookstores, faculty housing, student apartments, guest houses, chapels, theaters, public museums, and other similar auxiliary enterprises. This definition also includes any other categories of activities, costs of which are “unallowable” to Federal awards, unless otherwise indicated in an award.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Criteria for Distribution</HD>
              <P>a. <E T="03">Base period.</E> A base period for distribution of indirect (F&amp;A) costs is the period during which the costs are incurred. The base period normally should coincide with the fiscal year established by the institution, but in any event the base period should be so selected as to avoid inequities in the distribution of costs.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Need for cost groupings.</E> The overall objective of the indirect (F&amp;A) cost allocation process is to distribute the indirect (F&amp;A) costs described in Section B, Identification and assignment of indirect (F&amp;A) costs, to the major functions of the institution in proportions reasonably consistent with the nature and extent of their use of the institution's resources. In order to achieve this objective, it may be necessary to provide for selective distribution by establishing separate groupings of cost within one or more of the indirect (F&amp;A) cost categories referred to in subsection B.1. In general, the cost groupings established within a category should constitute, in each case, a pool of those items of expense that are considered to be of like nature in terms of their relative contribution to (or degree of remoteness from) the particular cost objectives to which distribution is appropriate. Cost groupings should be established considering the general guides provided in subsection c of this section. Each such pool or cost grouping should then be distributed individually to the related cost objectives, using the distribution base or method most appropriate in light of the guidelines set forth in subsection d of this section.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">General considerations on cost groupings.</E> The extent to which separate cost groupings and selective distribution would be appropriate at an institution is a matter of judgment to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Typical situations which may warrant the establishment of two or more separate cost groupings (based on account classification or analysis) within an indirect (F&amp;A) cost category include but are not limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) If certain items or categories of expense relate solely to one of the major functions of the institution or to less than all functions, such expenses should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for direct assignment or selective allocation in accordance with the guides provided in subsections b and d.</P>
              <P>(2) If any types of expense ordinarily treated as general administration or departmental administration are charged to Federal awards as direct costs, expenses applicable to other activities of the institution when incurred for the same purposes in like circumstances must, through separate cost groupings, be excluded from the indirect (F&amp;A) costs allocable to those Federal awards and included in the direct cost of other activities for cost allocation purposes.</P>
              <P>(3) If it is determined that certain expenses are for the support of a service unit or facility whose output is susceptible of measurement on a workload or other quantitative basis, such expenses should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for distribution on such basis to organized research, instructional, and other activities at the institution or within the department.</P>
              <P>(4) If activities provide their own purchasing, personnel administration, building maintenance or similar service, the distribution of general administration and general expenses, or operation and maintenance expenses to such activities should be accomplished through cost groupings which include only that portion of central indirect (F&amp;A) costs (such as for overall management) which are properly allocable to such activities.</P>
              <P>(5) If the institution elects to treat fringe benefits as indirect (F&amp;A) charges, such costs should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for selective distribution to related cost objectives.</P>
              <P>(6) The number of separate cost groupings within a category should be held within practical limits, after taking into consideration the materiality of the amounts involved and the degree of precision attainable through less selective methods of distribution.</P>
              <P>d. Selection of distribution method.</P>

              <P>(1) Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the method or base to be used in distributing individual cost <PRTPAGE P="359"/>groupings. The essential consideration in selecting a base is that it be the one best suited for assigning the pool of costs to cost objectives in accordance with benefits derived; with a traceable cause-and-effect relationship; or with logic and reason, where neither benefit nor a cause-and-effect relationship is determinable.</P>
              <P>(2) If a cost grouping can be identified directly with the cost objective benefitted, it should be assigned to that cost objective.</P>
              <P>(3) If the expenses in a cost grouping are more general in nature, the distribution may be based on a cost analysis study which results in an equitable distribution of the costs. Such cost analysis studies may take into consideration weighting factors, population, or space occupied if appropriate. Cost analysis studies, however, must (a) be appropriately documented in sufficient detail for subsequent review by the cognizant agency for indirect costs, (b) distribute the costs to the related cost objectives in accordance with the relative benefits derived, (c) be statistically sound, (d) be performed specifically at the institution at which the results are to be used, and (e) be reviewed periodically, but not less frequently than rate negotiations, updated if necessary, and used consistently. Any assumptions made in the study must be stated and explained. The use of cost analysis studies and periodic changes in the method of cost distribution must be fully justified.</P>
              <P>(4) If a cost analysis study is not performed, or if the study does not result in an equitable distribution of the costs, the distribution must be made in accordance with the appropriate base cited in Section B, unless one of the following conditions is met:</P>
              <P>(a) It can be demonstrated that the use of a different base would result in a more equitable allocation of the costs, or that a more readily available base would not increase the costs charged to Federal awards, or</P>
              <P>(b) The institution qualifies for, and elects to use, the simplified method for computing indirect (F&amp;A) cost rates described in Section D.</P>
              <P>(5) Notwithstanding subsection (3), effective July 1, 1998, a cost analysis or base other than that in Section B must not be used to distribute utility or student services costs. Instead, subsections B.4.c may be used in the recovery of utility costs.</P>
              <P>e. Order of distribution.</P>
              <P>(1) Indirect (F&amp;A) costs are the broad categories of costs discussed in Section B.1.</P>
              <P>(2) Depreciation, interest expenses, operation and maintenance expenses, and general administrative and general expenses should be allocated in that order to the remaining indirect (F&amp;A) cost categories as well as to the major functions and specialized service facilities of the institution. Other cost categories may be allocated in the order determined to be most appropriate by the institutions. When cross allocation of costs is made as provided in subsection (3), this order of allocation does not apply.</P>
              <P>(3) Normally an indirect (F&amp;A) cost category will be considered closed once it has been allocated to other cost objectives, and costs may not be subsequently allocated to it. However, a cross allocation of costs between two or more indirect (F&amp;A) cost categories may be used if such allocation will result in a more equitable allocation of costs. If a cross allocation is used, an appropriate modification to the composition of the indirect (F&amp;A) cost categories described in Section B is required.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Definition of Facilities and Administration</HD>
              <P>See § 75.414 which provides the basis for these indirect cost requirements.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Depreciation</HD>
              <P>a. The expenses under this heading are the portion of the costs of the institution's buildings, capital improvements to land and buildings, and equipment which are computed in accordance with § 75.436.</P>
              <P>b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(1) Depreciation on buildings used exclusively in the conduct of a single function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be assigned to that function.</P>
              <P>(2) Depreciation on buildings used for more than one function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be allocated to the individual functions performed in each building on the basis of usable square feet of space, excluding common areas such as hallways, stairwells, and rest rooms.</P>

              <P>(3) Depreciation on buildings, capital improvements and equipment related to space (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> individual rooms, laboratories) used jointly by more than one function (as determined by the users of the space) must be treated as follows. The cost of each jointly used unit of space must be allocated to benefitting functions on the basis of:</P>
              <P>(a) The employee full-time equivalents (FTEs) or salaries and wages of those individual functions benefitting from the use of that space; or</P>
              <P>(b) Institution-wide employee FTEs or salaries and wages applicable to the benefitting major functions (see Section A.1) of the institution.</P>

              <P>(4) Depreciation on certain capital improvements to land, such as paved parking <PRTPAGE P="360"/>areas, fences, sidewalks, and the like, not included in the cost of buildings, must be allocated to user categories of students and employees on a full-time equivalent basis. The amount allocated to the student category must be assigned to the instruction function of the institution. The amount allocated to the employee category must be further allocated to the major functions of the institution in proportion to the salaries and wages of all employees applicable to those functions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Interest</HD>
              <P>Interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, as defined in § 75.449, must be classified as an expenditure under the category Facilities. These costs must be allocated in the same manner as the depreciation on the buildings, equipment and capital improvements to which the interest relates.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Operation and Maintenance Expenses</HD>
              <P>a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the administration, supervision, operation, maintenance, preservation, and protection of the institution's physical plant. They include expenses normally incurred for such items as janitorial and utility services; repairs and ordinary or normal alterations of buildings, furniture and equipment; care of grounds; maintenance and operation of buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake and disaster preparedness; environmental safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability and all other insurance relating to property; space and capital leasing; facility planning and management; and central receiving. The operation and maintenance expense category should also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, depreciation, and interest costs.</P>
              <P>b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated in the same manner as described in subsection 2.b for depreciation.</P>
              <P>c. A utility cost adjustment of up to 1.3 percentage points may be included in the negotiated indirect cost rate of the IHE for organized research, per the computation alternatives in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Where space is devoted to a single function and metering allows unambiguous measurement of usage related to that space, costs must be assigned to the function located in that space.</P>
              <P>(2) Where space is allocated to different functions and metering does not allow unambiguous measurement of usage by function, costs must be allocated as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Utilities costs should be apportioned to functions in the same manner as depreciation, based on the calculated difference between the site or building actual square footage for monitored research laboratory space (site, building, floor, or room), and a separate calculation prepared by the IHE using the “effective square footage” described in subsection (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) “Effective square footage” allocated to research laboratory space must be calculated as the actual square footage times the relative energy utilization index (REUI) posted on the OMB Web site at the time of a rate determination.</P>
              <P>A. This index is the ratio of a laboratory energy use index (lab EUI) to the corresponding index for overall average college or university space (college EUI).</P>

              <P>B. In July 2012, values for these two indices (taken respectively from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory “Labs for the 21st Century” benchmarking tool <E T="03">http://labs21benchmarking.lbl.gov/CompareData.php</E> and the US Department of Energy “Buildings Energy Databook” and <E T="03">http://buildingsdatabook.eren.doe.gov/CBECS.aspx</E>) were 310 kBtu/sq ft-yr. and 155 kBtu/sq ft-yr., so that the adjustment ratio is 2.0 by this methodology. To retain currency, OMB will adjust the EUI numbers from time to time (no more often than annually nor less often than every 5 years), using reliable and publicly disclosed data. Current values of both the EUIs and the REUI will be posted on the OMB Web site.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. General Administration and General Expenses</HD>

              <P>a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the general executive and administrative offices of educational institutions and other expenses of a general character which do not relate solely to any major function of the institution; <E T="03">i.e.,</E> solely to (1) instruction, (2) organized research, (3) other sponsored activities, or (4) other institutional activities. The general administration and general expense category should also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, operation and maintenance expense, depreciation, and interest costs. Examples of general administration and general expenses include: Those expenses incurred by administrative offices that serve the entire university system of which the institution is a part; central offices of the institution such as the President's or Chancellor's office, the offices for institution-wide financial management, business services, budget and planning, personnel management, and safety and risk management; the office of the General Counsel; and the operations of the central administrative management information systems. General administration and general expenses must not include expenses incurred within non-<PRTPAGE P="361"/>university-wide deans' offices, academic departments, organized research units, or similar organizational units. (See subsection 6.)</P>
              <P>b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be grouped first according to common major functions of the institution to which they render services or provide benefits. The aggregate expenses of each group must then be allocated to serviced or benefitted functions on the modified total cost basis. Modified total costs consist of the same elements as those in Section C.2. When an activity included in this indirect (F&amp;A) cost category provides a service or product to another institution or organization, an appropriate adjustment must be made to either the expenses or the basis of allocation or both, to assure a proper allocation of costs.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Departmental Administration Expenses</HD>
              <P>a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for administrative and supporting services that benefit common or joint departmental activities or objectives in academic deans' offices, academic departments and divisions, and organized research units. Organized research units include such units as institutes, study centers, and research centers. Departmental administration expenses are subject to the following limitations.</P>
              <P>(1) Academic deans' offices. Salaries and operating expenses are limited to those attributable to administrative functions.</P>
              <P>(2) Academic departments:</P>
              <P>(a) Salaries and fringe benefits attributable to the administrative work (including bid and proposal preparation) of faculty (including department heads) and other professional personnel conducting research and/or instruction, must be allowed at a rate of 3.6 percent of modified total direct costs. This category does not include professional business or professional administrative officers. This allowance must be added to the computation of the indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate for major functions in Section C; the expenses covered by the allowance must be excluded from the departmental administration cost pool. No documentation is required to support this allowance.</P>
              <P>(b) Other administrative and supporting expenses incurred within academic departments are allowable provided they are treated consistently in like circumstances. This would include expenses such as the salaries of secretarial and clerical staffs, the salaries of administrative officers and assistants, travel, office supplies, stockrooms, and the like.</P>
              <P>(3) Other fringe benefit costs applicable to the salaries and wages included in subsections (1) and (2) are allowable, as well as an appropriate share of general administration and general expenses, operation and maintenance expenses, and depreciation.</P>
              <P>(4) Federal agencies may authorize reimbursement of additional costs for department heads and faculty only in exceptional cases where an institution can demonstrate undue hardship or detriment to project performance.</P>
              <P>b. The following guidelines apply to the determination of departmental administrative costs as direct or indirect (F&amp;A) costs.</P>

              <P>(1) In developing the departmental administration cost pool, special care should be exercised to ensure that costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances are treated consistently as either direct or indirect (F&amp;A) costs. For example, salaries of technical staff, laboratory supplies (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> chemicals), telephone toll charges, animals, animal care costs, computer costs, travel costs, and specialized shop costs must be treated as direct costs wherever identifiable to a particular cost objective. Direct charging of these costs may be accomplished through specific identification of individual costs to benefitting cost objectives, or through recharge centers or specialized service facilities, as appropriate under the circumstances. See §§ 75.413(c) and 75.468.</P>
              <P>(2) Items such as office supplies, postage, local telephone costs, and memberships must normally be treated as indirect (F&amp;A) costs.</P>
              <P>c. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The administrative expenses of the dean's office of each college and school must be allocated to the academic departments within that college or school on the modified total cost basis.</P>
              <P>(2) The administrative expenses of each academic department, and the department's share of the expenses allocated in subsection (1) must be allocated to the appropriate functions of the department on the modified total cost basis.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Sponsored Projects Administration</HD>

              <P>a. The expenses under this heading are limited to those incurred by a separate organization(s) established primarily to administer sponsored projects, including such functions as grant and contract administration (Federal and non-Federal), special security, purchasing, personnel, administration, and editing and publishing of research and other reports. They include the salaries and expenses of the head of such organization, assistants, and immediate staff, together with the salaries and expenses of personnel engaged in supporting activities maintained by the organization, such as stock rooms, print shops, and the like. This category also includes an allocable share of fringe benefit costs, general administration and general expenses, <PRTPAGE P="362"/>operation and maintenance expenses, and depreciation. Appropriate adjustments will be made for services provided to other functions or organizations.</P>
              <P>b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated to the major functions of the institution under which the sponsored projects are conducted on the basis of the modified total cost of sponsored projects.</P>
              <P>c. An appropriate adjustment must be made to eliminate any duplicate charges to Federal awards when this category includes similar or identical activities as those included in the general administration and general expense category or other indirect (F&amp;A) cost items, such as accounting, procurement, or personnel administration.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Library Expenses</HD>
              <P>a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the operation of the library, including the cost of books and library materials purchased for the library, less any items of library income that qualify as applicable credits under § 75.406. The library expense category should also include the fringe benefits applicable to the salaries and wages included therein, an appropriate share of general administration and general expense, operation and maintenance expense, and depreciation. Costs incurred in the purchases of rare books (museum-type books) with no value to Federal awards should not be allocated to them.</P>
              <P>b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated first on the basis of primary categories of users, including students, professional employees, and other users.</P>
              <P>(1) The student category must consist of full-time equivalent students enrolled at the institution, regardless of whether they earn credits toward a degree or certificate.</P>
              <P>(2) The professional employee category must consist of all faculty members and other professional employees of the institution, on a full-time equivalent basis. This category may also include post-doctorate fellows and graduate students.</P>
              <P>(3) The other users category must consist of a reasonable factor as determined by institutional records to account for all other users of library facilities.</P>
              <P>c. Amount allocated in paragraph b of this section must be assigned further as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount in the student category must be assigned to the instruction function of the institution.</P>
              <P>(2) The amount in the professional employee category must be assigned to the major functions of the institution in proportion to the salaries and wages of all faculty members and other professional employees applicable to those functions.</P>
              <P>(3) The amount in the other users category must be assigned to the other institutional activities function of the institution.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Student Administration and Services</HD>
              <P>a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the administration of student affairs and for services to students, including expenses of such activities as deans of students, admissions, registrar, counseling and placement services, student advisers, student health and infirmary services, catalogs, and commencements and convocations. The salaries of members of the academic staff whose responsibilities to the institution require administrative work that benefits sponsored projects may also be included to the extent that the portion charged to student administration is determined in accordance with Subpart E of this part. This expense category also includes the fringe benefit costs applicable to the salaries and wages included therein, an appropriate share of general administration and general expenses, operation and maintenance, interest expense, and depreciation.</P>
              <P>b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses in this category must be allocated to the instruction function, and subsequently to Federal awards in that function.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Offset for Indirect (F&amp;A) Expenses Otherwise Provided for by the Federal Government</HD>
              <P>a. The items to be accumulated under this heading are the reimbursements and other payments from the Federal Government which are made to the institution to support solely, specifically, and directly, in whole or in part, any of the administrative or service activities described in subsections 2 through 9.</P>
              <P>b. The items in this group must be treated as a credit to the affected individual indirect (F&amp;A) cost category before that category is allocated to benefitting functions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">C. Determination and Application of Indirect (F&amp;A) Cost Rate or Rates</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Indirect (F&amp;A) Cost Pools</HD>
              <P>a. (1) Subject to subsection b, the separate categories of indirect (F&amp;A) costs allocated to each major function of the institution as prescribed in Section B of this paragraph C.1-, must be aggregated and treated as a common pool for that function. The amount in each pool must be divided by the distribution base described in subsection 2 to arrive at a single indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate for each function.</P>

              <P>(2) The rate for each function is used to distribute indirect (F&amp;A) costs to individual Federal awards of that function. Since a common pool is established for each major <PRTPAGE P="363"/>function of the institution, a separate indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate would be established for each of the major functions described in Section A.1 under which Federal awards are carried out.</P>
              <P>(3) Each institution's indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate process must be appropriately designed to ensure that Federal sponsors do not in any way subsidize the indirect (F&amp;A) costs of other sponsors, specifically activities sponsored by industry and foreign governments. Accordingly, each allocation method used to identify and allocate the indirect (F&amp;A) cost pools, as described in Sections A.2, and B.2 through B.9, must contain the full amount of the institution's modified total costs or other appropriate units of measurement used to make the computations. In addition, the final rate distribution base (as defined in subsection 2) for each major function (organized research, instruction, etc., as described in Section A.1) must contain all the programs or activities which utilize the indirect (F&amp;A) costs allocated to that major function. At the time an indirect (F&amp;A) cost proposal is submitted to a cognizant agency for indirect costs, each institution must describe the process it uses to ensure that Federal funds are not used to subsidize industry and foreign government funded programs.</P>
              <P>b. In some instances a single rate basis for use across the board on all work within a major function at an institution may not be appropriate. A single rate for research, for example, might not take into account those different environmental factors and other conditions which may affect substantially the indirect (F&amp;A) costs applicable to a particular segment of research at the institution. A particular segment of research may be that performed under a single sponsored agreement or it may consist of research under a group of Federal awards performed in a common environment. The environmental factors are not limited to the physical location of the work. Other important factors are the level of the administrative support required, the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, the scientific disciplines or technical skills involved, the organizational arrangements used, or any combination thereof. If a particular segment of a sponsored agreement is performed within an environment which appears to generate a significantly different level of indirect (F&amp;A) costs, provisions should be made for a separate indirect (F&amp;A) cost pool applicable to such work. The separate indirect (F&amp;A) cost pool should be developed during the regular course of the rate determination process and the separate indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate resulting therefrom should be utilized; provided it is determined that (1) such indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate differs significantly from that which would have been obtained under subsection a, and (2) the volume of work to which such rate would apply is material in relation to other Federal awards at the institution.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. The Distribution Basis</HD>
              <P>Indirect (F&amp;A) costs must be distributed to applicable Federal awards and other benefitting activities within each major function (see section A.1, Major functions of an institution) on the basis of modified total direct costs (MTDC), consisting of all salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the first $25,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period covered by the subaward). MTDC is defined in § 75.2. For this purpose, an indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate should be determined for each of the separate indirect (F&amp;A) cost pools developed pursuant to subsection 1. The rate in each case should be stated as the percentage which the amount of the particular indirect (F&amp;A) cost pool is of the modified total direct costs identified with such pool.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Negotiated Lump Sum for Indirect (F&amp;A) Costs</HD>
              <P>A negotiated fixed amount in lieu of indirect (F&amp;A) costs may be appropriate for self-contained, off-campus, or primarily subcontracted activities where the benefits derived from an institution's indirect (F&amp;A) services cannot be readily determined. Such negotiated indirect (F&amp;A) costs will be treated as an offset before allocation to instruction, organized research, other sponsored activities, and other institutional activities. The base on which such remaining expenses are allocated should be appropriately adjusted.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Predetermined Rates for Indirect (F&amp;A) Costs</HD>

              <P>Public Law 87-638 (76 Stat. 437) as amended (41 U.S.C. 4708) authorizes the use of predetermined rates in determining the “indirect costs” (indirect (F&amp;A) costs) applicable under research agreements with educational institutions. The stated objectives of the law are to simplify the administration of cost-type research and development contracts (including grants) with educational institutions, to facilitate the preparation of their budgets, and to permit more expeditious closeout of such contracts when the work is completed. In view of the potential advantages offered by this procedure, negotiation of predetermined rates for indirect (F&amp;A) costs for a period of two to four years should be the norm in those situations where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable the parties involved to reach an informed judgment as to the probable level of indirect (F&amp;A) costs during the ensuing accounting periods.<PRTPAGE P="364"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Negotiated Fixed Rates and Carry-Forward Provisions</HD>
              <P>When a fixed rate is negotiated in advance for a fiscal year (or other time period), the over- or under-recovery for that year may be included as an adjustment to the indirect (F&amp;A) cost for the next rate negotiation. When the rate is negotiated before the carry-forward adjustment is determined, the carry-forward amount may be applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation. When such adjustments are to be made, each fixed rate negotiated in advance for a given period will be computed by applying the expected indirect (F&amp;A) costs allocable to Federal awards for the forecast period plus or minus the carry-forward adjustment (over- or under-recovery) from the prior period, to the forecast distribution base. Unrecovered amounts under lump-sum agreements or cost-sharing provisions of prior years must not be carried forward for consideration in the new rate negotiation. There must, however, be an advance understanding in each case between the institution and the cognizant agency for indirect costs as to whether these differences will be considered in the rate negotiation rather than making the determination after the differences are known. Further, institutions electing to use this carry-forward provision may not subsequently change without prior approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs. In the event that an institution returns to a post-determined rate, any over- or under-recovery during the period in which negotiated fixed rates and carry-forward provisions were followed will be included in the subsequent post-determined rates. Where multiple rates are used, the same procedure will be applicable for determining each rate.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Provisional and Final Rates for Indirect (F&amp;A) Costs</HD>
              <P>Where the cognizant agency for indirect costs determines that cost experience and other pertinent facts do not justify the use of predetermined rates, or a fixed rate with a carry-forward, or if the parties cannot agree on an equitable rate, a provisional rate must be established. To prevent substantial overpayment or underpayment, the provisional rate may be adjusted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs during the institution's fiscal year. Predetermined or fixed rates may replace provisional rates at any time prior to the close of the institution's fiscal year. If a provisional rate is not replaced by a predetermined or fixed rate prior to the end of the institution's fiscal year, a final rate will be established and upward or downward adjustments will be made based on the actual allowable costs incurred for the period involved.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Fixed Rates for the Life of the Sponsored Agreement</HD>
              <P>a. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of § 75.414 Federal agencies must use the negotiated rates for indirect (F&amp;A) costs in effect at the time of the initial award throughout the life of the Federal award. Award levels for Federal awards may not be adjusted in future years as a result of changes in negotiated rates. “Negotiated rates” per the rate agreement include final, fixed, and predetermined rates and exclude provisional rates. “Life” for the purpose of this subsection means each competitive segment of a project. A competitive segment is a period of years approved by the Federal awarding agency at the time of the Federal award. If negotiated rate agreements do not extend through the life of the Federal award at the time of the initial award, then the negotiated rate for the last year of the Federal award must be extended through the end of the life of the Federal award.</P>
              <P>b. Except as provided in § 75.414, when an educational institution does not have a negotiated rate with the Federal Government at the time of an award (because the educational institution is a new recipient or the parties cannot reach agreement on a rate), the provisional rate used at the time of the award must be adjusted once a rate is negotiated and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Limitation on Reimbursement of Administrative Costs</HD>
              <P>a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C.1.a, the administrative costs charged to Federal awards awarded or amended (including continuation and renewal awards) with effective dates beginning on or after the start of the institution's first fiscal year which begins on or after October 1, 1991, must be limited to 26% of modified total direct costs (as defined in subsection 2) for the total of General Administration and General Expenses, Departmental Administration, Sponsored Projects Administration, and Student Administration and Services (including their allocable share of depreciation, interest costs, operation and maintenance expenses, and fringe benefits costs, as provided by Section B, Identification and assignment of indirect (F&amp;A) costs, and all other types of expenditures not listed specifically under one of the subcategories of facilities in Section B.</P>

              <P>b. Institutions should not change their accounting or cost allocation methods if the effect is to change the charging of a particular type of cost from F&amp;A to direct, or to reclassify costs, or increase allocations from the administrative pools identified in paragraph B.1 of this Appendix to the other F&amp;A cost pools or fringe benefits. Cognizant agencies for indirect cost are authorized to allow <PRTPAGE P="365"/>changes where an institution's charging practices are at variance with acceptable practices followed by a substantial majority of other institutions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Alternative Method for Administrative Costs</HD>
              <P>a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C.1.a, an institution may elect to claim a fixed allowance for the “Administration” portion of indirect (F&amp;A) costs. The allowance could be either 24% of modified total direct costs or a percentage equal to 95% of the most recently negotiated fixed or predetermined rate for the cost pools included under “Administration” as defined in Section B.1, whichever is less. Under this alternative, no cost proposal need be prepared for the “Administration” portion of the indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate nor is further identification or documentation of these costs required (see subsection c). Where a negotiated indirect (F&amp;A) cost agreement includes this alternative, an institution must make no further charges for the expenditure categories described in Section B.5, Section B.6, Section B.7, and Section B.9.</P>
              <P>b. In negotiations of rates for subsequent periods, an institution that has elected the option of subsection a may continue to exercise it at the same rate without further identification or documentation of costs.</P>
              <P>c. If an institution elects to accept a threshold rate as defined in subsection a of this section, it is not required to perform a detailed analysis of its administrative costs. However, in order to compute the facilities components of its indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate, the institution must reconcile its indirect (F&amp;A) cost proposal to its financial statements and make appropriate adjustments and reclassifications to identify the costs of each major function as defined in Section A.1, as well as to identify and allocate the facilities components. Administrative costs that are not identified as such by the institution's accounting system (such as those incurred in academic departments) will be classified as instructional costs for purposes of reconciling indirect (F&amp;A) cost proposals to financial statements and allocating facilities costs.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Individual Rate Components</HD>
              <P>In order to provide mutually agreed-upon information for management purposes, each indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate negotiation or determination must include development of a rate for each indirect (F&amp;A) cost pool as well as the overall indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Negotiation and Approval of Indirect (F&amp;A) Rate</HD>
              <P>a. Cognizant agency for indirect costs is defined in § 75.2.</P>
              <P>(1) Cost negotiation cognizance is assigned to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or the Department of Defense's Office of Naval Research (DOD), normally depending on which of the two agencies (HHS or DOD) provides more funds to the educational institution for the most recent three years. Information on funding must be derived from relevant data gathered by the National Science Foundation. In cases where neither HHS nor DOD provides Federal funding to an educational institution, the cognizant agency for indirect costs assignment must default to HHS. Notwithstanding the method for cognizance determination described in this section, other arrangements for cognizance of a particular educational institution may also be based in part on the types of research performed at the educational institution and must be decided based on mutual agreement between HHS and DOD. Where a non-Federal entity only receives funds as a subrecipient, see the requirements of § 75.352.</P>
              <P>(2) After cognizance is established, it must continue for a five-year period.</P>

              <P>c. Correcting deficiencies. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must negotiate changes needed to correct systems deficiencies relating to accountability for Federal awards. Cognizant agencies for indirect costs must address the concerns of other affected agencies, as appropriate, and must negotiate special rates for Federal agencies that are required to limit recovery of indirect costs by statute.</P>
              <P>d. Resolving questioned costs. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must conduct any necessary negotiations with an educational institution regarding amounts questioned by audit that are due the Federal Government related to costs covered by a negotiated agreement.</P>
              <P>e. Reimbursement. Reimbursement to cognizant agencies for indirect costs for work performed under this Part may be made by reimbursement billing under the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 1535.</P>
              <P>f. Procedure for establishing facilities and administrative rates must be established by one of the following methods:</P>

              <P>(1) Formal negotiation. The cognizant agency for indirect costs is responsible for negotiating and approving rates for an educational institution on behalf of all Federal agencies. Federal awarding agencies that do not have cognizance for indirect costs must notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs of specific concerns (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a need to establish special cost rates) which could affect the negotiation process. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must address the concerns of all interested agencies, as appropriate. A pre-negotiation conference may be scheduled among all interested agencies, if necessary. The cognizant agency for indirect <PRTPAGE P="366"/>costs must then arrange a negotiation conference with the educational institution.</P>
              <P>(2) Other than formal negotiation. The cognizant agency for indirect costs and educational institution may reach an agreement on rates without a formal negotiation conference; for example, through correspondence or use of the simplified method described in this section D of this Appendix.</P>
              <P>g. Formalizing determinations and agreements. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must formalize all determinations or agreements reached with an educational institution and provide copies to other agencies having an interest. Determinations should include a description of any adjustments, the actual amount, both dollar and percentage adjusted, and the reason for making adjustments.</P>
              <P>h. Disputes and disagreements. Where the cognizant agency for indirect costs is unable to reach agreement with an educational institution with regard to rates or audit resolution, the appeal system of the cognizant agency for indirect costs must be followed for resolution of the disagreement.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Standard Format for Submission</HD>
              <P>For facilities and administrative (indirect (F&amp;A)) rate proposals, educational institutions must use the standard format, shown in section E of this appendix, to submit their indirect (F&amp;A) rate proposal to the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may, on an institution-by-institution basis, grant exceptions from all or portions of Part II of the standard format requirement. This requirement does not apply to educational institutions that use the simplified method for calculating indirect (F&amp;A) rates, as described in Section D of this Appendix.</P>
              <P>As provided in section C.10, each F&amp;A cost rate negotiation or determination must include development of a rate for each F&amp;A cost pool as well as the overall F&amp;A rate.</P>

              <P>a. Where the total direct cost of work covered by this part 75 at an institution does not exceed $10 million in a fiscal year, the simplified procedure described in subsections 2 or 3 may be used in determining allowable indirect (F&amp;A) costs. Under this simplified procedure, the institution's most recent annual financial report and immediately available supporting information must be utilized as a basis for determining the indirect (F&amp;A) cost rate applicable to all Federal awards. The institution may use either the salaries and wages (see subsection 2) or modified total direct costs (see subsection 3) as the distribution basis.</P>
              <P>b. The simplified procedure should not be used where it produces results which appear inequitable to the Federal Government or the institution. In any such case, indirect (F&amp;A) costs should be determined through use of the regular procedure.</P>

              <EAR>Pt. 75, App. IV</EAR>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix IV to Part 75—Indirect (F&amp;A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. General</HD>
              <P>1. Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or joint objectives and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective. Direct cost of minor amounts may be treated as indirect costs under the conditions described in § 75.413(d). After direct costs have been determined and assigned directly to awards or other work as appropriate, indirect costs are those remaining to be allocated to benefitting cost objectives. A cost may not be allocated to a Federal award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, has been assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost.</P>
              <P>2. “Major nonprofit organizations” are defined in § 75.414(a). See indirect cost rate reporting requirements in sections B.2.e and B.3.g. of this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. Allocation of Indirect Costs and Determination of Indirect Cost Rates</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. General</HD>
              <P>a. If a nonprofit organization has only one major function, or where all its major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs and the computation of an indirect cost rate may be accomplished through simplified allocation procedures, as described in section B.2 of this Appendix.</P>
              <P>b. If an organization has several major functions which benefit from its indirect costs in varying degrees, allocation of indirect costs may require the accumulation of such costs into separate cost groupings which then are allocated individually to benefitting functions by means of a base which best measures the relative degree of benefit. The indirect costs allocated to each function are then distributed to individual Federal awards and other activities included in that function by means of an indirect cost rate(s).</P>
              <P>c. The determination of what constitutes an organization's major functions will depend on its purpose in being; the types of services it renders to the public, its clients, and its members; and the amount of effort it devotes to such activities as fundraising, public information and membership activities.</P>
              <P>d. Specific methods for allocating indirect costs and computing indirect cost rates along with the conditions under which each method should be used are described in section B.2 through B.5 of this Appendix.</P>
              <P>e. The base period for the allocation of indirect costs is the period in which such costs are incurred and accumulated for allocation to work performed in that period. The base period normally should coincide with the organization's fiscal year but, in any event, must be so selected as to avoid inequities in the allocation of the costs.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Simplified Allocation Method</HD>
              <P>a. Where an organization's major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs may be accomplished by (i) separating the organization's total costs for the base period as either direct or indirect, and (ii) dividing the total allowable indirect costs (net of applicable credits) by an equitable distribution base. The result of this process is an indirect cost rate which is used to distribute indirect costs to individual Federal awards. The rate should be expressed as the percentage which the total amount of allowable indirect costs bears to the base selected. This method should also be used where an organization has only one major function encompassing a number of individual projects or activities, and may be used where the level of Federal awards to an organization is relatively small.</P>
              <P>b. Both the direct costs and the indirect costs must exclude capital expenditures and unallowable costs. However, unallowable costs which represent activities must be included in the direct costs under the conditions described in § 75.413(e).</P>
              <P>c. The distribution base may be total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other distorting items, such as subawards for $25,000 or more), direct salaries and wages, or other base which results in an equitable distribution. The distribution base must exclude participant support costs as defined in § 75.2.</P>
              <P>d. Except where a special rate(s) is required in accordance with section B.5 of this Appendix, the indirect cost rate developed under the above principles is applicable to all Federal awards of the organization. If a special rate(s) is required, appropriate modifications must be made in order to develop the special rate(s).</P>

              <P>e. For an organization that receives more than $10 million in direct Federal funding in a fiscal year, a breakout of the indirect cost component into two broad categories, Facilities and Administration as defined in § 75.414(a), is required. The rate in each case must be stated as the percentage which the amount of the particular indirect cost category (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> Facilities or Administration) is of the distribution base identified with that category.<PRTPAGE P="369"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Multiple Allocation Base Method</HD>
              <P>a. General. Where an organization's indirect costs benefit its major functions in varying degrees, indirect costs must be accumulated into separate cost groupings, as described in subparagraph b. Each grouping must then be allocated individually to benefitting functions by means of a base which best measures the relative benefits. The default allocation bases by cost pool are described in section B.3.c of this Appendix.</P>
              <P>b. Identification of indirect costs. Cost groupings must be established so as to permit the allocation of each grouping on the basis of benefits provided to the major functions. Each grouping must constitute a pool of expenses that are of like character in terms of functions they benefit and in terms of the allocation base which best measures the relative benefits provided to each function. The groupings are classified within the two broad categories: “Facilities” and “Administration,” as described in section A.3 of this Appendix. The indirect cost pools are defined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Depreciation. The expenses under this heading are the portion of the costs of the organization's buildings, capital improvements to land and buildings, and equipment which are computed in accordance with § 75.436 .</P>
              <P>(2) Interest. Interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements are computed in accordance with § 75.449.</P>
              <P>(3) Operation and maintenance expenses. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the administration, operation, maintenance, preservation, and protection of the organization's physical plant. They include expenses normally incurred for such items as: janitorial and utility services; repairs and ordinary or normal alterations of buildings, furniture and equipment; care of grounds; maintenance and operation of buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake and disaster preparedness; environmental safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability and other insurance relating to property; space and capital leasing; facility planning and management; and central receiving. The operation and maintenance expenses category must also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, depreciation, and interest costs.</P>
              <P>(4) General administration and general expenses. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the overall general executive and administrative offices of the organization and other expenses of a general nature which do not relate solely to any major function of the organization. This category must also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, operation and maintenance expense, depreciation, and interest costs. Examples of this category include central offices, such as the director's office, the office of finance, business services, budget and planning, personnel, safety and risk management, general counsel, management information systems, and library costs.</P>
              <P>In developing this cost pool, special care should be exercised to ensure that costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances are treated consistently as either direct or indirect costs. For example, salaries of technical staff, project supplies, project publication, telephone toll charges, computer costs, travel costs, and specialized services costs must be treated as direct costs wherever identifiable to a particular program. The salaries and wages of administrative and pooled clerical staff should normally be treated as indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate as described in § 75.413. Items such as office supplies, postage, local telephone costs, periodicals and memberships should normally be treated as indirect costs.</P>
              <P>c. Allocation bases. Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the base to be used in allocating the expenses in each grouping to benefitting functions. The essential consideration in selecting a method or a base is that it is the one best suited for assigning the pool of costs to cost objectives in accordance with benefits derived; a traceable cause and effect relationship; or logic and reason, where neither the cause nor the effect of the relationship is determinable. When an allocation can be made by assignment of a cost grouping directly to the function benefitted, the allocation must be made in that manner. When the expenses in a cost grouping are more general in nature, the allocation must be made through the use of a selected base which produces results that are equitable to both the Federal Government and the organization. The distribution must be made in accordance with the bases described herein unless it can be demonstrated that the use of a different base would result in a more equitable allocation of the costs, or that a more readily available base would not increase the costs charged to Federal awards. The results of special cost studies (such as an engineering utility study) must not be used to determine and allocate the indirect costs to Federal awards.</P>
              <P>(1) Depreciation. Depreciation expenses must be allocated in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(a) Depreciation on buildings used exclusively in the conduct of a single function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be assigned to that function.</P>

              <P>(b) Depreciation on buildings used for more than one function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be allocated to the individual functions performed in each building on the basis of <PRTPAGE P="370"/>usable square feet of space, excluding common areas, such as hallways, stairwells, and restrooms.</P>

              <P>(c) Depreciation on buildings, capital improvements and equipment related space (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> individual rooms, and laboratories) used jointly by more than one function (as determined by the users of the space) must be treated as follows. The cost of each jointly used unit of space must be allocated to the benefitting functions on the basis of:</P>
              <P>(i) the employees and other users on a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis or salaries and wages of those individual functions benefitting from the use of that space; or</P>
              <P>(ii) organization-wide employee FTEs or salaries and wages applicable to the benefitting functions of the organization.</P>
              <P>(d) Depreciation on certain capital improvements to land, such as paved parking areas, fences, sidewalks, and the like, not included in the cost of buildings, must be allocated to user categories on a FTE basis and distributed to major functions in proportion to the salaries and wages of all employees applicable to the functions.</P>
              <P>(2) Interest. Interest costs must be allocated in the same manner as the depreciation on the buildings, equipment and capital equipment to which the interest relates.</P>
              <P>(3) Operation and maintenance expenses. Operation and maintenance expenses must be allocated in the same manner as the depreciation.</P>
              <P>(4) General administration and general expenses. General administration and general expenses must be allocated to benefitting functions based on modified total costs (MTC). The MTC is the modified total direct costs (MTDC), as described in § 75.2, plus the allocated indirect cost proportion. The expenses included in this category could be grouped first according to major functions of the organization to which they render services or provide benefits. The aggregate expenses of each group must then be allocated to benefitting functions based on MTC.</P>
              <P>d. Order of distribution.</P>
              <P>(1) Indirect cost categories consisting of depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration and general expenses must be allocated in that order to the remaining indirect cost categories as well as to the major functions of the organization. Other cost categories should be allocated in the order determined to be most appropriate by the organization. This order of allocation does not apply if cross allocation of costs is made as provided in section B.3.d.2 of this Appendix.</P>
              <P>(2) Normally, an indirect cost category will be considered closed once it has been allocated to other cost objectives, and costs must not be subsequently allocated to it. However, a cross allocation of costs between two or more indirect costs categories could be used if such allocation will result in a more equitable allocation of costs. If a cross allocation is used, an appropriate modification to the composition of the indirect cost categories is required.</P>
              <P>e. Application of indirect cost rate or rates. Except where a special indirect cost rate(s) is required in accordance with section B.5 of this Appendix, the separate groupings of indirect costs allocated to each major function must be aggregated and treated as a common pool for that function. The costs in the common pool must then be distributed to individual Federal awards included in that function by use of a single indirect cost rate.</P>
              <P>f. Distribution basis. Indirect costs must be distributed to applicable Federal awards and other benefitting activities within each major function on the basis of MTDC (see definition in § 75.2).</P>
              <P>g. Individual Rate Components. An indirect cost rate must be determined for each separate indirect cost pool developed. The rate in each case must be stated as the percentage which the amount of the particular indirect cost pool is of the distribution base identified with that pool. Each indirect cost rate negotiation or determination agreement must include development of the rate for each indirect cost pool as well as the overall indirect cost rate. The indirect cost pools must be classified within two broad categories: “Facilities” and “Administration,” as described in § 75.414(a).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Direct Allocation Method</HD>
              <P>a. Some nonprofit organizations treat all costs as direct costs except general administration and general expenses. These organizations generally separate their costs into three basic categories: (i) General administration and general expenses, (ii) fundraising, and (iii) other direct functions (including projects performed under Federal awards). Joint costs, such as depreciation, rental costs, operation and maintenance of facilities, telephone expenses, and the like are prorated individually as direct costs to each category and to each Federal award or other activity using a base most appropriate to the particular cost being prorated.</P>
              <P>b. This method is acceptable, provided each joint cost is prorated using a base which accurately measures the benefits provided to each Federal award or other activity. The bases must be established in accordance with reasonable criteria, and be supported by current data. This method is compatible with the Standards of Accounting and Financial Reporting for Voluntary Health and Welfare Organizations issued jointly by the National Health Council, Inc., the National Assembly of Voluntary Health and Social Welfare Organizations, and the United Way of America.</P>

              <P>c. Under this method, indirect costs consist exclusively of general administration and general expenses. In all other respects, the organization's indirect cost rates must <PRTPAGE P="371"/>be computed in the same manner as that described in section B.2 of this Appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Special Indirect Cost Rates</HD>
              <P>In some instances, a single indirect cost rate for all activities of an organization or for each major function of the organization may not be appropriate, since it would not take into account those different factors which may substantially affect the indirect costs applicable to a particular segment of work. For this purpose, a particular segment of work may be that performed under a single Federal award or it may consist of work under a group of Federal awards performed in a common environment. These factors may include the physical location of the work, the level of administrative support required, the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, the scientific disciplines or technical skills involved, the organizational arrangements used, or any combination thereof. When a particular segment of work is performed in an environment which appears to generate a significantly different level of indirect costs, provisions should be made for a separate indirect cost pool applicable to such work. The separate indirect cost pool should be developed during the course of the regular allocation process, and the separate indirect cost rate resulting therefrom should be used, provided it is determined that (i) the rate differs significantly from that which would have been obtained under sections B.2, B.3, and B.4 of this Appendix, and (ii) the volume of work to which the rate would apply is material.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Definitions</HD>
              <P>As used in this section, the following terms have the meanings set forth in this section:</P>
              <P>a. <E T="03">Cognizant agency for indirect costs</E> means the Federal agency responsible for negotiating and approving indirect cost rates for a nonprofit organization on behalf of all Federal agencies.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Predetermined rate</E> means an indirect cost rate, applicable to a specified current or future period, usually the organization's fiscal year. The rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be incurred during the period. A predetermined rate is not subject to adjustment.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Fixed rate</E> means an indirect cost rate which has the same characteristics as a predetermined rate, except that the difference between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the period covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period.</P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">Final rate</E> means an indirect cost rate applicable to a specified past period which is based on the actual costs of the period. A final rate is not subject to adjustment.</P>
              <P>e. <E T="03">Provisional rate or billing rate</E> means a temporary indirect cost rate applicable to a specified period which is used for funding, interim reimbursement, and reporting indirect costs on Federal awards pending the establishment of a final rate for the period.</P>
              <P>f. <E T="03">Indirect cost proposal</E> means the documentation prepared by an organization to substantiate its claim for the reimbursement of indirect costs. This proposal provides the basis for the review and negotiation leading to the establishment of an organization's indirect cost rate.</P>
              <P>g. <E T="03">Cost objective</E> means a function, organizational subdivision, contract, Federal award, or other work unit for which cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate and measure the cost of processes, projects, jobs and capitalized projects.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Negotiation and Approval of Rates</HD>
              <P>a. Unless different arrangements are agreed to by the Federal agencies concerned, the Federal agency with the largest dollar value of Federal awards with an organization will be designated as the cognizant agency for indirect costs for the negotiation and approval of the indirect cost rates and, where necessary, other rates such as fringe benefit and computer charge-out rates. Once an agency is assigned cognizance for a particular nonprofit organization, the assignment will not be changed unless there is a shift in the dollar volume of the Federal awards to the organization for at least three years. All concerned Federal agencies must be given the opportunity to participate in the negotiation process but, after a rate has been agreed upon, it will be accepted by all Federal agencies. When a Federal agency has reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its Federal awards necessitate special indirect cost rates in accordance with section B.5 of this Appendix, it will, prior to the time the rates are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs. (See also § 75.414.) Where a non-Federal entity only receives funds as a subrecipient, see the requirements of § 75.352.</P>
              <P>b. Except as otherwise provided in § 75.414(f), a nonprofit organization which has not previously established an indirect cost rate with a Federal agency must submit its initial indirect cost proposal immediately after the organization is advised that a Federal award will be made and, in no event, later than three months after the effective date of the Federal award.</P>

              <P>c. Unless approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs in accordance with § 75.414(g), organizations that have previously established indirect cost rates must submit a new indirect cost proposal to the cognizant agency for indirect costs within six months after the close of each fiscal year.<PRTPAGE P="372"/>
              </P>
              <P>d. A predetermined rate may be negotiated for use on Federal awards where there is reasonable assurance, based on past experience and reliable projection of the organization's costs, that the rate is not likely to exceed a rate based on the organization's actual costs.</P>
              <P>e. Fixed rates may be negotiated where predetermined rates are not considered appropriate. A fixed rate, however, must not be negotiated if (i) all or a substantial portion of the organization's Federal awards are expected to expire before the carry-forward adjustment can be made; (ii) the mix of Federal and non-Federal work at the organization is too erratic to permit an equitable carry-forward adjustment; or (iii) the organization's operations fluctuate significantly from year to year.</P>
              <P>f. Provisional and final rates must be negotiated where neither predetermined nor fixed rates are appropriate. Predetermined or fixed rates may replace provisional rates at any time prior to the close of the organization's fiscal year. If that event does not occur, a final rate will be established and upward or downward adjustments will be made based on the actual allowable costs incurred for the period involved.</P>
              <P>g. The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the nonprofit organization. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must make available copies of the agreement to all concerned Federal agencies.</P>
              <P>h. If a dispute arises in a negotiation of an indirect cost rate between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the nonprofit organization, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</P>
              <P>i. To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal agencies in connection with the negotiation and approval process, OMB will lend assistance as required to resolve such problems in a timely manner.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">D. Certification of Indirect (F&amp;A) Costs</HD>
              <P>1. Required Certification. No proposal to establish indirect (F&amp;A) cost rates must be acceptable unless such costs have been certified by the non-profit organization using the Certificate of Indirect (F&amp;A) Costs set forth in subsection 2., below. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the organization by an individual at a level no lower than vice president or chief financial officer for the organization.</P>
              <P>2. Each indirect cost rate proposal must be accompanied by a certification in the following form:</P>
              <P>Certificate of Indirect (F&amp;A) Costs</P>
              <P>This is to certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief:</P>
              <P>(1) I have reviewed the indirect (F&amp;A) cost proposal submitted herewith;</P>
              <P>(2) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish billing or final indirect (F&amp;A) costs rate for [identify period covered by rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of the Federal awards to which they apply and with Subpart E of part 75.</P>
              <P>(3) This proposal does not include any costs which are unallowable under Subpart E of part 75 such as (without limitation): public relations costs, contributions and donations, entertainment costs, fines and penalties, lobbying costs, and defense of fraud proceedings; and</P>
              <P>(4) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the Federal awards to which they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements.</P>
              <P>I declare that the foregoing is true and correct.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix V to Part 75—State/Local Governmentwide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. General</HD>
              <P>1. Most governmental units provide certain services, such as motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, accounting, etc., to operating agencies on a centralized basis. Since federally-supported awards are performed within the individual operating agencies, there needs to be a process whereby these central service costs can be identified and assigned to benefitted activities on a reasonable and consistent basis. The central service cost allocation plan provides that process. All costs and other data used to distribute the costs included in the plan should be supported by formal accounting and other records that will support the propriety of the costs assigned to Federal awards.</P>

              <P>2. Guidelines and illustrations of central service cost allocation plans are provided in a brochure published by the Department of Health and Human Services entitled “<E T="03">A Guide for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments: Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government</E>.” A copy of this brochure may be obtained from the HHS' Cost Allocation Services or at their Web site at <E T="03">https://rates.psc.gov</E>.<PRTPAGE P="373"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. Definitions</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Agency or operating agency</E> means an organizational unit or sub-division within a governmental unit that is responsible for the performance or administration of Federal awards or activities of the governmental unit.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Allocated central services</E> means central services that benefit operating agencies but are not billed to the agencies on a fee-for-service or similar basis. These costs are allocated to benefitted agencies on some reasonable basis. Examples of such services might include general accounting, personnel administration, purchasing, etc.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Billed central services</E> means central services that are billed to benefitted agencies or programs on an individual fee-for-service or similar basis. Typical examples of billed central services include computer services, transportation services, insurance, and fringe benefits.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Cognizant agency for indirect costs</E> is defined in § 75.2. The determination of cognizant agency for indirect costs for states and local governments is described in section F.1.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Major local government</E> means local government that receives more than $100 million in direct Federal awards subject to this part.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">C. Scope of the Central Service Cost Allocation Plans</HD>
              <P>The central service cost allocation plan will include all central service costs that will be claimed (either as a billed or an allocated cost) under Federal awards and will be documented as described in section E. Costs of central services omitted from the plan will not be reimbursed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">D. Submission Requirements</HD>
              <P>1. Each state will submit a plan to the Department of Health and Human Services for each year in which it claims central service costs under Federal awards. The plan should include (a) a projection of the next year's allocated central service cost (based either on actual costs for the most recently completed year or the budget projection for the coming year), and (b) a reconciliation of actual allocated central service costs to the estimated costs used for either the most recently completed year or the year immediately preceding the most recently completed year.</P>
              <P>2. Each major local government is also required to submit a plan to its cognizant agency for indirect costs annually.</P>
              <P>3. All other local governments claiming central service costs must develop a plan in accordance with the requirements described in this Part and maintain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit. These local governments are not required to submit their plans for Federal approval unless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. Where a local government only receives funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for monitoring the subrecipient's plan.</P>
              <P>4. All central service cost allocation plans will be prepared and, when required, submitted within six months prior to the beginning of each of the governmental unit's fiscal years in which it proposes to claim central service costs. Extensions may be granted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">E. Documentation Requirements for Submitted Plans</HD>
              <P>The documentation requirements described in this section may be modified, expanded, or reduced by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on a case-by-case basis. For example, the requirements may be reduced for those central services which have little or no impact on Federal awards. Conversely, if a review of a plan indicates that certain additional information is needed, and will likely be needed in future years, it may be routinely requested in future plan submissions. Items marked with an asterisk (*) should be submitted only once; subsequent plans should merely indicate any changes since the last plan.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. General</HD>
              <P>All proposed plans must be accompanied by the following: An organization chart sufficiently detailed to show operations including the central service activities of the state/local government whether or not they are shown as benefitting from central service functions; a copy of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (or a copy of the Executive Budget if budgeted costs are being proposed) to support the allowable costs of each central service activity included in the plan; and, a certification (see subsection 4.) that the plan was prepared in accordance with this Part, contains only allowable costs, and was prepared in a manner that treated similar costs consistently among the various Federal awards and between Federal and non-Federal awards/activities.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Allocated Central Services</HD>

              <P>For each allocated central service*, the plan must also include the following: a brief description of the service, an identification of the unit rendering the service and the operating agencies receiving the service, the items of expense included in the cost of the service, the method used to distribute the cost of the service to benefitted agencies, and a summary schedule showing the allocation of each service to the specific benefitted agencies. If any self-insurance funds or fringe benefits costs are treated as allocated <PRTPAGE P="374"/>(rather than billed) central services, documentation discussed in subsections 3.b. and c. must also be included.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Billed Services</HD>
              <P>a. <E T="03">General.</E> The information described in this section must be provided for all billed central services, including internal service funds, self-insurance funds, and fringe benefit funds.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Internal service funds.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(1) For each internal service fund or similar activity with an operating budget of $5 million or more, the plan must include: A brief description of each service; a balance sheet for each fund based on individual accounts contained in the governmental unit's accounting system; a revenue/expenses statement, with revenues broken out by source, <E T="03">e.g.</E>, regular billings, interest earned, etc.; a listing of all non-operating transfers (as defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)) into and out of the fund; a description of the procedures (methodology) used to charge the costs of each service to users, including how billing rates are determined; a schedule of current rates; and, a schedule comparing total revenues (including imputed revenues) generated by the service to the allowable costs of the service, as determined under this Part, with an explanation of how variances will be handled.</P>

              <P>(2) Revenues must consist of all revenues generated by the service, including unbilled and uncollected revenues. If some users were not billed for the services (or were not billed at the full rate for that class of users), a schedule showing the full imputed revenues associated with these users must be provided. Expenses must be broken out by object cost categories (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> salaries, supplies, etc.).</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Self-insurance funds.</E> For each self-insurance fund, the plan must include: The fund balance sheet; a statement of revenue and expenses including a summary of billings and claims paid by agency; a listing of all non-operating transfers into and out of the fund; the type(s) of risk(s) covered by the fund (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, automobile liability, workers' compensation, etc.); an explanation of how the level of fund contributions are determined, including a copy of the current actuarial report (with the actuarial assumptions used) if the contributions are determined on an actuarial basis; and, a description of the procedures used to charge or allocate fund contributions to benefitted activities. Reserve levels in excess of claims (1) submitted and adjudicated but not paid, (2) submitted but not adjudicated, and (3) incurred but not submitted must be identified and explained.</P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">Fringe benefits.</E> For fringe benefit costs, the plan must include: A listing of fringe benefits provided to covered employees, and the overall annual cost of each type of benefit; current fringe benefit policies; and procedures used to charge or allocate the costs of the benefits to benefitted activities. In addition, for pension and post-retirement health insurance plans, the following information must be provided: the governmental unit's funding policies, <E T="03">e.g.</E>, legislative bills, trust agreements, or state-mandated contribution rules, if different from actuarially determined rates; the pension plan's costs accrued for the year; the amount funded, and date(s) of funding; a copy of the current actuarial report (including the actuarial assumptions); the plan trustee's report; and, a schedule from the activity showing the value of the interest cost associated with late funding.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Required Certification</HD>
              <P>Each central service cost allocation plan will be accompanied by a certification in the following form:</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Certificate of Cost Allocation Plan</HD>
              <P>This is to certify that I have reviewed the cost allocation plan submitted herewith and to the best of my knowledge and belief:</P>
              <P>(1) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish cost allocations or billings for [identify period covered by plan] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of this Part and the Federal award(s) to which they apply. Unallowable costs have been adjusted for in allocating costs as indicated in the cost allocation plan.</P>
              <P>(2) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the Federal awards to which they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements. Further, the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs have not been claimed as direct costs. Similar types of costs have been accounted for consistently.</P>

              <P>In general, unless different arrangements are agreed to by the concerned Federal agencies, for central service cost allocation plans, the cognizant agency responsible for review and approval is the Federal agency with the largest dollar value of total Federal awards with a governmental unit. For indirect cost rates and departmental indirect cost allocation plans, the cognizant agency <PRTPAGE P="375"/>is the Federal agency with the largest dollar value of direct Federal awards with a governmental unit or component, as appropriate. Once designated as the cognizant agency for indirect costs, the Federal agency must remain so for a period of five years. In addition, the following Federal agencies continue to be responsible for the indicated governmental entities:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Department of Health and Human Services</E>—Public assistance and state-wide cost allocation plans for all states (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico), state and local hospitals, libraries and health districts.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Review</HD>
              <P>All proposed central service cost allocation plans that are required to be submitted will be reviewed, negotiated, and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on a timely basis. The cognizant agency for indirect costs will review the proposal within six months of receipt of the proposal and either negotiate/approve the proposal or advise the governmental unit of the additional documentation needed to support/evaluate the proposed plan or the changes required to make the proposal acceptable. Once an agreement with the governmental unit has been reached, the agreement will be accepted and used by all Federal agencies, unless prohibited or limited by statute. Where a Federal awarding agency has reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its Federal awards necessitate special consideration, the funding agency will, prior to the time the plans are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Agreement</HD>
              <P>The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the governmental unit. This agreement will be subject to re-opening if the agreement is subsequently found to violate a statute or the information upon which the plan was negotiated is later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate. The results of the negotiation must be made available to all Federal agencies for their use.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Adjustments</HD>
              <P>Negotiated cost allocation plans based on a proposal later found to have included costs that: (a) Are unallowable (i) as specified by law or regulation, (ii) as identified in subpart F, General Provisions for selected Items of Cost of this Part, or (iii) by the terms and conditions of Federal awards, or (b) are unallowable because they are clearly not allocable to Federal awards, must be adjusted, or a refund must be made at the option of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs regulations. Adjustments or cash refunds may include, at the option of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, earned or imputed interest from the date of expenditure and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable cognizant agency claims collection regulations. These adjustments or refunds are designed to correct the plans and do not constitute a reopening of the negotiation.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Billed Central Service Activities</HD>
              <P>Each billed central service activity must separately account for all revenues (including imputed revenues) generated by the service, expenses incurred to furnish the service, and profit/loss.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Working Capital Reserves</HD>
              <P>Internal service funds are dependent upon a reasonable level of working capital reserve to operate from one billing cycle to the next. Charges by an internal service activity to provide for the establishment and maintenance of a reasonable level of working capital reserve, in addition to the full recovery of costs, are allowable. A working capital reserve as part of retained earnings of up to 60 calendar days cash expenses for normal operating purposes is considered reasonable. A working capital reserve exceeding 60 calendar days may be approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs in exceptional cases.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Carry-Forward Adjustments of Allocated Central Service Costs</HD>

              <P>Allocated central service costs are usually negotiated and approved for a future fiscal year on a “fixed with carry-forward” basis. Under this procedure, the fixed amounts for <PRTPAGE P="376"/>the future year covered by agreement are not subject to adjustment for that year. However, when the actual costs of the year involved become known, the differences between the fixed amounts previously approved and the actual costs will be carried forward and used as an adjustment to the fixed amounts established for a later year. This “carry-forward” procedure applies to all central services whose costs were fixed in the approved plan. However, a carry-forward adjustment is not permitted, for a central service activity that was not included in the approved plan, or for unallowable costs that must be reimbursed immediately.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Adjustments of Billed Central Services</HD>
              <P>Billing rates used to charge Federal awards must be based on the estimated costs of providing the services, including an estimate of the allocable central service costs. A comparison of the revenue generated by each billed service (including total revenues whether or not billed or collected) to the actual allowable costs of the service will be made at least annually, and an adjustment will be made for the difference between the revenue and the allowable costs. These adjustments will be made through one of the following adjustment methods: (a) A cash refund including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs regulations to the Federal Government for the Federal share of the adjustment, (b) credits to the amounts charged to the individual programs, (c) adjustments to future billing rates, or (d) adjustments to allocated central service costs. Adjustments to allocated central services will not be permitted where the total amount of the adjustment for a particular service (Federal share and non-Federal) share exceeds $500,000. Adjustment methods may include, at the option of the cognizant agency, earned or imputed interest from the date of expenditure and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable cognizant agency claims collection regulations.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Records Retention</HD>
              <P>All central service cost allocation plans and related documentation used as a basis for claiming costs under Federal awards must be retained for audit in accordance with the records retention requirements contained in Subpart D of part 75.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Appeals</HD>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix VI to Part 75—Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. General</HD>
              <P>Federally-financed programs administered by state public assistance agencies are funded predominately by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In support of its stewardship requirements, HHS has published requirements for the development, documentation, submission, negotiation, and approval of public assistance cost allocation plans in Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95. All administrative costs (direct and indirect) are normally charged to Federal awards by implementing the public assistance cost allocation plan. This Appendix extends these requirements to all Federal awarding agencies whose programs are administered by a state public assistance agency. Major federally-financed programs typically administered by state public assistance agencies include: Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, Food Stamps, Child Support Enforcement, Adoption Assistance and Foster Care, and Social Services Block Grant.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. Definitions</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">State public assistance agency</E> means a state agency administering or supervising the administration of one or more public assistance programs operated by the state as identified in Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95. For the purpose of this Appendix, these programs include all programs administered by the state public assistance agency.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">State public assistance agency costs</E> means all costs incurred by, or allocable to, the state public assistance agency, except expenditures for financial assistance, medical contractor payments, food stamps, and payments for services and goods provided directly to program recipients.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">C. Policy</HD>

              <P>State public assistance agencies will develop, document and implement, and the Federal Government will review, negotiate, and approve, public assistance cost allocation plans in accordance with Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95. The plan will include all programs administered by the state public assistance agency. Where a letter of approval <PRTPAGE P="377"/>or disapproval is transmitted to a state public assistance agency in accordance with Subpart E, the letter will apply to all Federal agencies and programs. The remaining sections of this Appendix (except for the requirement for certification) summarize the provisions of Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">D. Submission, Documentation, and Approval of Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans</HD>
              <P>1. State public assistance agencies are required to promptly submit amendments to the cost allocation plan to HHS for review and approval.</P>
              <P>2. Under the coordination process outlined in section E, Review of Implementation of Approved Plans, affected Federal agencies will review all new plans and plan amendments and provide comments, as appropriate, to HHS. The effective date of the plan or plan amendment will be the first day of the calendar quarter following the event that required the amendment, unless another date is specifically approved by HHS. HHS, as the cognizant agency for indirect costs acting on behalf of all affected Federal agencies, will, as necessary, conduct negotiations with the state public assistance agency and will inform the state agency of the action taken on the plan or plan amendment.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">E. Review of Implementation of Approved Plans</HD>
              <P>1. Since public assistance cost allocation plans are of a narrative nature, the review during the plan approval process consists of evaluating the appropriateness of the proposed groupings of costs (cost centers) and the related allocation bases. As such, the Federal Government needs some assurance that the cost allocation plan has been implemented as approved. This is accomplished by reviews by the Federal awarding agencies, single audits, or audits conducted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</P>
              <P>2. Where inappropriate charges affecting more than one Federal awarding agency are identified, the cognizant HHS cost negotiation office will be advised and will take the lead in resolving the issue(s) as provided for in Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95.</P>
              <P>3. If a dispute arises in the negotiation of a plan or from a disallowance involving two or more Federal awarding agencies, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures set out in 45 CFR part 16. Disputes involving only one Federal awarding agency will be resolved in accordance with the Federal awarding agency's appeal process.</P>
              <P>4. To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal awarding agencies or governmental units in connection with the negotiation and approval process, the Office of Management and Budget will lend assistance, as required, to resolve such problems in a timely manner.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">F. Unallowable Costs</HD>
              <P>Claims developed under approved cost allocation plans will be based on allowable costs as identified in this Part. Where unallowable costs have been claimed and reimbursed, they will be refunded to the program that reimbursed the unallowable cost using one of the following methods: (a) A cash refund, (b) offset to a subsequent claim, or (c) credits to the amounts charged to individual Federal awards. Cash refunds, offsets, and credits may include at the option of the cognizant agency for indirect cost, earned or imputed interest from the date of expenditure and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable cognizant agency for indirect cost claims collection regulations.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix VII to Part 75—States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. General</HD>
              <P>1. Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or joint purposes. These costs benefit more than one cost objective and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective without effort disproportionate to the results achieved. After direct costs have been determined and assigned directly to Federal awards and other activities as appropriate, indirect costs are those remaining to be allocated to benefitted cost objectives. A cost may not be allocated to a Federal award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, has been assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost.</P>
              <P>2. Indirect costs include (a) the indirect costs originating in each department or agency of the governmental unit carrying out Federal awards and (b) the costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost allocation plan (as described in Appendix V to part) and not otherwise treated as direct costs.</P>

              <P>3. Indirect costs are normally charged to Federal awards by the use of an indirect cost rate. A separate indirect cost rate(s) is usually necessary for each department or agency of the governmental unit claiming indirect costs under Federal awards. Guidelines and illustrations of indirect cost proposals are provided in a brochure published by the Department of Health and Human Services entitled “<E T="03">A Guide for States and Local Government Agencies: Cost Principles and Procedures for Establishing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Grants and Contracts with the Federal Government.”</E> A copy of this brochure may be obtained from the HHS' Cost <PRTPAGE P="378"/>Allocation Services or at their Web site at <E T="03">https://rates.psc.gov</E>.</P>
              <P>4. Because of the diverse characteristics and accounting practices of governmental units, the types of costs which may be classified as indirect costs cannot be specified in all situations. However, typical examples of indirect costs may include certain state/local-wide central service costs, general administration of the non-Federal entity accounting and personnel services performed within the non-Federal entity, depreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining facilities.</P>
              <P>5. This Appendix does not apply to state public assistance agencies. These agencies should refer instead to Appendix VI to part 75.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. Definitions</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Base</E> means the accumulated direct costs (normally either total direct salaries and wages or total direct costs exclusive of any extraordinary or distorting expenditures) used to distribute indirect costs to individual Federal awards. The direct cost base selected should result in each Federal award bearing a fair share of the indirect costs in reasonable relation to the benefits received from the costs.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Base period</E> for the allocation of indirect costs is the period in which such costs are incurred and accumulated for allocation to activities performed in that period. The base period normally should coincide with the governmental unit's fiscal year, but in any event, must be so selected as to avoid inequities in the allocation of costs.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Cognizant agency for indirect costs</E> means the Federal agency responsible for reviewing and approving the governmental unit's indirect cost rate(s) on the behalf of the Federal Government. The cognizant agency for indirect costs assignment is described in Appendix V, section F.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Final rate</E> means an indirect cost rate applicable to a specified past period which is based on the actual allowable costs of the period. A final audited rate is not subject to adjustment.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Fixed rate</E> means an indirect cost rate which has the same characteristics as a predetermined rate, except that the difference between the estimated costs and the actual, allowable costs of the period covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">Indirect cost pool</E> is the accumulated costs that jointly benefit two or more programs or other cost objectives.</P>
              <P>7. <E T="03">Indirect cost rate</E> is a device for determining in a reasonable manner the proportion of indirect costs each program should bear. It is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the indirect costs to a direct cost base.</P>
              <P>8. <E T="03">Indirect cost rate proposal</E> means the documentation prepared by a governmental unit or subdivision thereof to substantiate its request for the establishment of an indirect cost rate.</P>
              <P>9. <E T="03">Predetermined rate</E> means an indirect cost rate, applicable to a specified current or future period, usually the governmental unit's fiscal year. This rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be incurred during the period. Except under very unusual circumstances, a predetermined rate is not subject to adjustment. (Because of legal constraints, predetermined rates are not permitted for Federal contracts; they may, however, be used for grants or cooperative agreements.) Predetermined rates may not be used by governmental units that have not submitted and negotiated the rate with the cognizant agency for indirect costs. In view of the potential advantages offered by this procedure, negotiation of predetermined rates for indirect costs for a period of two to four years should be the norm in those situations where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable the parties involved to reach an informed judgment as to the probable level of indirect costs during the ensuing accounting periods.</P>
              <P>10. <E T="03">Provisional rate</E> means a temporary indirect cost rate applicable to a specified period which is used for funding, interim reimbursement, and reporting indirect costs on Federal awards pending the establishment of a “final” rate for that period.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">C. Allocation of Indirect Costs and Determination of Indirect Cost Rates</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. General</HD>
              <P>a. Where a governmental unit's department or agency has only one major function, or where all its major functions benefit from the indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs and the computation of an indirect cost rate may be accomplished through simplified allocation procedures as described in subsection 2.</P>
              <P>b. Where a governmental unit's department or agency has several major functions which benefit from its indirect costs in varying degrees, the allocation of indirect costs may require the accumulation of such costs into separate cost groupings which then are allocated individually to benefitted functions by means of a base which best measures the relative degree of benefit. The indirect costs allocated to each function are then distributed to individual Federal awards and other activities included in that function by means of an indirect cost rate(s).</P>

              <P>c. Specific methods for allocating indirect costs and computing indirect cost rates along with the conditions under which each method should be used are described in subsections 2, 3 and 4.<PRTPAGE P="379"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Simplified Method</HD>
              <P>a. Where a non-Federal entity's major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs may be accomplished by (1) classifying the non-Federal entity's total costs for the base period as either direct or indirect, and (2) dividing the total allowable indirect costs (net of applicable credits) by an equitable distribution base. The result of this process is an indirect cost rate which is used to distribute indirect costs to individual Federal awards. The rate should be expressed as the percentage which the total amount of allowable indirect costs bears to the base selected. This method should also be used where a governmental unit's department or agency has only one major function encompassing a number of individual projects or activities, and may be used where the level of Federal awards to that department or agency is relatively small.</P>
              <P>b. Both the direct costs and the indirect costs must exclude capital expenditures and unallowable costs. However, unallowable costs must be included in the direct costs if they represent activities to which indirect costs are properly allocable.</P>
              <P>c. The distribution base may be (1) total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other distorting items, such as pass-through funds, subawards in excess of $25,000, participant support costs, etc.), (2) direct salaries and wages, or (3) another base which results in an equitable distribution.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Multiple Allocation Base Method</HD>
              <P>a. Where a non-Federal entity's indirect costs benefit its major functions in varying degrees, such costs must be accumulated into separate cost groupings. Each grouping must then be allocated individually to benefitted functions by means of a base which best measures the relative benefits.</P>
              <P>b. The cost groupings should be established so as to permit the allocation of each grouping on the basis of benefits provided to the major functions. Each grouping should constitute a pool of expenses that are of like character in terms of the functions they benefit and in terms of the allocation base which best measures the relative benefits provided to each function. The number of separate groupings should be held within practical limits, taking into consideration the materiality of the amounts involved and the degree of precision needed.</P>
              <P>c. Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the base to be used in allocating the expenses in each grouping to benefitted functions. When an allocation can be made by assignment of a cost grouping directly to the function benefitted, the allocation must be made in that manner. When the expenses in a grouping are more general in nature, the allocation should be made through the use of a selected base which produces results that are equitable to both the Federal Government and the governmental unit. In general, any cost element or related factor associated with the governmental unit's activities is potentially adaptable for use as an allocation base provided that: (1) It can readily be expressed in terms of dollars or other quantitative measures (total direct costs, direct salaries and wages, staff hours applied, square feet used, hours of usage, number of documents processed, population served, and the like), and (2) it is common to the benefitted functions during the base period.</P>
              <P>d. Except where a special indirect cost rate(s) is required in accordance with paragraph (C)(4) of this Appendix, the separate groupings of indirect costs allocated to each major function must be aggregated and treated as a common pool for that function. The costs in the common pool must then be distributed to individual Federal awards included in that function by use of a single indirect cost rate.</P>
              <P>e. The distribution base used in computing the indirect cost rate for each function may be (1) total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other distorting items such as pass-through funds, subawards in excess of $25,000, participant support costs, etc.), (2) direct salaries and wages, or (3) another base which results in an equitable distribution. An indirect cost rate should be developed for each separate indirect cost pool developed. The rate in each case should be stated as the percentage relationship between the particular indirect cost pool and the distribution base identified with that pool.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Special Indirect Cost Rates</HD>

              <P>a. In some instances, a single indirect cost rate for all activities of a non-Federal entity or for each major function of the agency may not be appropriate. It may not take into account those different factors which may substantially affect the indirect costs applicable to a particular program or group of programs. The factors may include the physical location of the work, the level of administrative support required, the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, the organizational arrangements used, or any combination thereof. When a particular Federal award is carried out in an environment which appears to generate a significantly different level of indirect costs, provisions should be made for a separate indirect cost pool applicable to that Federal award. The separate indirect cost pool should be developed during the course of the regular allocation process, and the separate indirect cost rate resulting therefrom should be used, provided that: (1) The rate differs significantly <PRTPAGE P="380"/>from the rate which would have been developed under paragraphs (C)(2) and (C)(3) of this Appendix, and (2) the Federal award to which the rate would apply is material in amount.</P>
              <P>b. Where Federal statutes restrict the reimbursement of certain indirect costs, it may be necessary to develop a special rate for the affected Federal award. Where a “restricted rate” is required, the same procedure for developing a non-restricted rate will be used except for the additional step of the elimination from the indirect cost pool those costs for which the law prohibits reimbursement.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">D. Submission and Documentation of Proposals</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Submission of Indirect Cost Rate Proposals</HD>
              <P>a. All departments or agencies of the governmental unit desiring to claim indirect costs under Federal awards must prepare an indirect cost rate proposal and related documentation to support those costs. The proposal and related documentation must be retained for audit in accordance with the records retention requirements contained in § 75.361.</P>
              <P>b. A governmental department or agency unit that receives more than $35 million in direct Federal funding must submit its indirect cost rate proposal to its cognizant agency for indirect costs. Other governmental department or agency must develop an indirect cost proposal in accordance with the requirements of this Part and maintain the proposal and related supporting documentation for audit. These governmental departments or agencies are not required to submit their proposals unless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. Where a non-Federal entity only receives funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for negotiating and/or monitoring the subrecipient's indirect costs.</P>
              <P>c. Each Indian tribal government desiring reimbursement of indirect costs must submit its indirect cost proposal to the Department of the Interior (its cognizant agency for indirect costs).</P>
              <P>d. Indirect cost proposals must be developed (and, when required, submitted) within six months after the close of the governmental unit's fiscal year, unless an exception is approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. If the proposed central service cost allocation plan for the same period has not been approved by that time, the indirect cost proposal may be prepared including an amount for central services that is based on the latest federally-approved central service cost allocation plan. The difference between these central service amounts and the amounts ultimately approved will be compensated for by an adjustment in a subsequent period.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Documentation of Proposals</HD>
              <P>The following must be included with each indirect cost proposal:</P>
              <P>a. The rates proposed, including subsidiary work sheets and other relevant data, cross referenced and reconciled to the financial data noted in subsection b. Allocated central service costs will be supported by the summary table included in the approved central service cost allocation plan. This summary table is not required to be submitted with the indirect cost proposal if the central service cost allocation plan for the same fiscal year has been approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs and is available to the funding agency.</P>
              <P>b. A copy of the financial data (financial statements, comprehensive annual financial report, executive budgets, accounting reports, etc.) upon which the rate is based. Adjustments resulting from the use of unaudited data will be recognized, where appropriate, by the Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs in a subsequent proposal.</P>
              <P>c. The approximate amount of direct base costs incurred under Federal awards. These costs should be broken out between salaries and wages and other direct costs.</P>
              <P>d. A chart showing the organizational structure of the agency during the period for which the proposal applies, along with a functional statement(s) noting the duties and/or responsibilities of all units that comprise the agency. (Once this is submitted, only revisions need be submitted with subsequent proposals.)</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Required Certification.</HD>
              <P>Each indirect cost rate proposal must be accompanied by a certification in the following form:</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Certificate of Indirect Costs</HD>
              <P>This is to certify that I have reviewed the indirect cost rate proposal submitted herewith and to the best of my knowledge and belief:</P>
              <P>(1) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish billing or final indirect costs rates for [identify period covered by rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of the Federal award(s) to which they apply and the provisions of this 45 CFR part 75. Unallowable costs have been adjusted for in allocating costs as indicated in the indirect cost proposal.</P>

              <P>(2) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the agreements to which they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements. Further, <PRTPAGE P="381"/>the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs have not been claimed as direct costs. Similar types of costs have been accounted for consistently and the Federal Government will be notified of any accounting changes that would affect the predetermined rate.</P>
              <P>I declare that the foregoing is true and correct.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">E. Negotiation and Approval of Rates</HD>
              <P>1. Indirect cost rates will be reviewed, negotiated, and approved by the cognizant agency on a timely basis. Once a rate has been agreed upon, it will be accepted and used by all Federal agencies unless prohibited or limited by statute. Where a Federal awarding agency has reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its Federal awards necessitate special indirect cost rates, the funding agency will, prior to the time the rates are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</P>
              <P>2. The use of predetermined rates, if allowed, is encouraged where the cognizant agency for indirect costs has reasonable assurance based on past experience and reliable projection of the non-Federal entity's costs, that the rate is not likely to exceed a rate based on actual costs. Long-term agreements utilizing predetermined rates extending over two or more years are encouraged, where appropriate.</P>
              <P>3. The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the governmental unit. This agreement will be subject to re-opening if the agreement is subsequently found to violate a statute, or the information upon which the plan was negotiated is later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate. The agreed upon rates must be made available to all Federal agencies for their use.</P>
              <P>4. Refunds must be made if proposals are later found to have included costs that (a) are unallowable (i) as specified by law or regulation, (ii) as identified in § 75.420 of this part, or (iii) by the terms and conditions of Federal awards, or (b) are unallowable because they are clearly not allocable to Federal awards. These adjustments or refunds will be made regardless of the type of rate negotiated (predetermined, final, fixed, or provisional).</P>

              <P>If overall fringe benefit rates are not approved for the governmental unit as part of the central service cost allocation plan, these rates will be reviewed, negotiated and approved for individual recipient agencies during the indirect cost negotiation process. In these cases, a proposed fringe benefit rate computation should accompany the indirect cost proposal. If fringe benefit rates are not used at the recipient agency level (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the agency specifically identifies fringe benefit costs to individual employees), the governmental unit should so advise the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Billed Services Provided by the Recipient Agency</HD>

              <P>In some cases, governmental departments or agencies (components of the governmental unit) provide and bill for services similar to those covered by central service cost allocation plans (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> computer centers). Where this occurs, the governmental departments or agencies (components of the governmental unit) should be guided by the requirements in Appendix V relating to the development of billing rates and documentation requirements, and should advise the cognizant agency for indirect costs of any billed services. Reviews of these types of services (including reviews of costing/billing methodology, profits or losses, etc.) will be made on a case-by-case basis as warranted by the circumstances involved.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Indirect Cost Allocations Not Using Rates</HD>
              <P>In certain situations, governmental departments or agencies (components of the governmental unit), because of the nature of their Federal awards, may be required to develop a cost allocation plan that distributes indirect (and, in some cases, direct) costs to the specific funding sources. In these cases, a narrative cost allocation methodology should be developed, documented, maintained for audit, or submitted, as appropriate, to the cognizant agency for indirect costs for review, negotiation, and approval.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix IX to Part 75—Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. Purpose and Scope</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Objectives</HD>
              <P>This appendix provides principles for determining the costs applicable to research and development work performed by hospitals under grants and contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services. These principles are confined to the subject of cost determination and make no attempt to identify the circumstances or dictate the extent of hospital participation in the financing of a particular research or development project. The principles are designed to provide recognition of the full allocated costs of such research work under generally accepted accounting principles. These principles will be applicable to both proprietary and non-profit hospitals. No provision for profit or other increment above cost is provided for in these principles. However, this is not to be interpreted as precluding a negotiated fee between contracting parties when a fee is appropriate.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Policy Guides</HD>
              <P>The successful application of these principles requires development of mutual understanding between representatives of hospitals and of the Department of Health and Human Services as to their scope, applicability and interpretation. It is recognized that:</P>
              <P>a. The arrangements for hospital participation in the financing of a research and development project are properly subject to negotiation between the agency and the hospital concerned in accordance with such Government-wide criteria as may be applicable.</P>

              <P>b. Each hospital, possessing its own unique combination of staff, facilities and experience, should be encouraged to conduct research in a manner consonant with its own institutional philosophies and objectives.<PRTPAGE P="383"/>
              </P>
              <P>c. Each hospital in the fulfillment of its contractual obligations should be expected to employ sound management practices.</P>
              <P>d. The application of the principles established herein shall be in conformance with the generally accepted accounting practices of hospitals.</P>
              <P>e. Hospitals receive reimbursements from the Federal Government for differing types of services under various programs such as support of Research and Development (including discrete clinical centers) Health Services Projects, Medicare, etc. It is essential that consistent procedures for determining reimbursable costs for similar services be employed without regard to program differences. Therefore, both the direct and indirect costs of research programs must be identified as a cost center(s) for the cost finding and step-down requirements of the Medicare program, or in its absence the Medicaid program.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Application</HD>
              <P>All operating agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services that sponsor research and development work in hospitals will apply these principles and related policy guides in determining the costs incurred for such work under grants and cost-reimbursement type contracts and subcontracts. These principles will also be used as a guide in the pricing of fixed-price contracts and subcontracts.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. Definition of Terms</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Organized research</E> means all research activities of a hospital that may be identified whether the support for such research is from a federal, non-federal or internal source.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Departmental research</E> means research activities that are not separately budgeted and accounted for. Such work, which includes all research activities not encompassed under the term organized research, is regarded for purposes of this document as a part of the patient care activities of the hospital.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Research agreement</E> means any valid arrangement to perform federally-sponsored research or development including grants, cost-reimbursement type contracts, cost-reimbursement type subcontracts, and fixed-price contracts and subcontracts.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Instruction and training</E> means the formal or informal programs of educating and training technical and professional health services personnel, primarily medical and nursing training. This activity, if separately budgeted or identifiable with specific costs, should be considered as a cost objective for purposes of indirect cost allocations and the development of patient care costs.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Other hospital activities</E> means all organized activities of a hospital not immediately related to the patient care, research, and instructional and training functions which produce identifiable revenue from the performance of these activities. If a non-related activity does not produce identifiable revenue, it may be necessary to allocate this expense using an appropriate basis. In such a case, the activity may be included as an allocable cost (See paragraph C.4 below.) Also included under this definition is any category of cost treated as “Unallowable,” provided such category of cost identifies a function or activity to which a portion of the institution's indirect cost (as defined in paragraph E.1.) are properly allocable.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">Patient care</E> means those departments or cost centers which render routine or ancillary services to in-patients and/or out-patients. As used in paragraph I.2.w, it means the cost of these services applicable to patients involved in research programs.</P>
              <P>7. <E T="03">Allocation</E> means the process by which the indirect costs are assigned as between:</P>
              <P>a. Organized research,</P>
              <P>b. Patient care including departmental research.</P>
              <P>c. Instruction and training, and</P>
              <P>d. Other hospital activities.</P>
              <P>8. <E T="03">Cost center</E> means an identifiable department or area (including research) within the hospital which has been assigned an account number in the hospital accounting system for the purpose of accumulating expense by department or area.</P>
              <P>9. <E T="03">Cost finding</E> is the process of recasting the data derived from the accounts ordinarily kept by a hospital to ascertain costs of the various types of services rendered. It is the determination of direct costs by specific identification and the proration of indirect costs by allocation.</P>
              <P>10. <E T="03">Step down</E> is a cost finding method that recognizes that services rendered by certain nonrevenue-producing departments or centers are utilized by certain other nonrevenue producing centers as well as by the revenue-producing centers. All costs of nonrevenue-producing centers are allocated to all centers which they serve, regardless of whether or not these centers produce revenue. Following the apportionment of the cost of the nonrevenue-producing center, that center will be considered closed and no further costs are apportioned to that center.</P>
              <P>11. <E T="03">Scatter bed</E> is a bed assigned to a research patient based on availability. Research patients occupying these beds are not physically segregated from nonresearch patients occupying beds. Scatter beds are geographically dispersed among all the beds available for use in the hospital. There are no special features attendant to a scatter bed that distinguishes it from others that could just as well have been occupied.</P>
              <P>12. <E T="03">Discrete bed</E> is a bed or beds that have been set aside for occupancy by research patients and are physically segregated from other hospital beds in an environment that <PRTPAGE P="384"/>permits an easily ascertainable allocation of costs associated with the space they occupy and the services they generate.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">C. Basic Considerations</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Composition of Total Costs</HD>
              <P>The cost of a research agreement is comprised of the allowable direct costs incident to its performance plus the allocable portion of the allowable indirect costs of the hospital less applicable credits. (See paragraph C.5.)</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Factors Affecting Allowability of Costs</HD>
              <P>The tests of allowability of costs under these principles are:</P>
              <P>a. They must be reasonable.</P>
              <P>b. They must be assigned to research agreements under the standards and methods provided herein.</P>
              <P>c. They must be accorded consistent treatment through application of those generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to the circumstances (See paragraph A.2.e.) and</P>
              <P>d. They must conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these principles or in the research agreement as to types or amounts of cost items.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Reasonable Costs</HD>
              <P>A cost may be considered reasonable if the nature of the goods or services acquired or applied, and the amount involved therefor reflect the action that a prudent person would have taken under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision to incur the cost was made. Major considerations involved in the determination of the reasonableness of a cost are:</P>
              <P>a. Whether or not the cost is of a type generally recognized as necessary for the operation of the hospital or the performance of the research agreement,</P>
              <P>b. The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as arm's length bargaining, federal and state laws and regulations, and research agreement terms and conditions,</P>
              <P>c. Whether or not the individuals concerned acted with due prudence in the circumstances, considering their responsibilities to the hospital, its patients, its employees, its students, the Government, and the public at large, and</P>
              <P>d. The extent to which the actions taken with respect to the incurrence of the cost are consistent with established hospital policies and practices applicable to the work of the hospital generally, including Government research.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Allocable Costs</HD>
              <P>a. A cost is allocable to a particular cost center (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a specific function, project, research agreement, department, or the like) if the goods or services involved are chargeable or assignable to such cost center in accordance with relative benefits received or other equitable relationship. Subject to the foregoing, a cost is allocable to a research agreement if it is incurred solely to advance the work under the research agreement; or it benefits both the research agreement and other work of the hospital in proportions that can be approximated through use of reasonable methods; or it is necessary to the overall operation of the hospital and, in light of the standards provided in this chapter, is deemed to be assignable in part to organized research. Where the purchase of equipment or other capital items are specifically authorized under a research agreement, the amounts thus authorized for such purchases are allocable to the research agreement regardless of the use that may subsequently be made of the equipment or other capital items involved.</P>
              <P>b. Any costs allocable to a particular research agreement under the standards provided in these principles may not be shifted to other research agreements in order to meet deficiencies caused by overruns or other fund considerations, to avoid restrictions imposed by law or by terms of the research agreement, or for other reasons of convenience.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Applicable Credits</HD>
              <P>a. The term applicable credits refers to those receipts or negative expenditure types of transactions which operate to offset or reduce expense items that are allocable to research agreements as direct or indirect costs as outlined in paragraph E.1. Typical examples of such transactions are: Purchase discounts, rebates, or allowances; recoveries or indemnities on losses; sales of scrap or incidental services; tuition; adjustments of overpayments or erroneous charges; and services rendered to patients admitted to federally funded clinical research centers, primarily for care though also participating in research protocols.</P>

              <P>b. In some instances, the amounts received from the Federal Government to finance hospital activities or service operations should be treated as applicable credits. Specifically, the concept of netting such credit items against related expenditures should be applied by the hospital in determining the rates or amounts to be charged to government research for services rendered whenever the facilities or other resources used in providing such services have been financed directly, in whole or in part, by federal funds. Thus, where such items are provided for or benefit a particular hospital activity, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> patient care, research, instruction and training, or other, they should be treated as an offset to the indirect costs apportioned to that activity. Where the benefits are common to all hospital activities they should be <PRTPAGE P="385"/>treated as a credit to the total indirect cost pool before allocation to the various cost objectives.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">D. Direct Costs</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. General</HD>
              <P>Direct costs are those that can be identified specifically with a particular cost center. For this purpose, the term cost center refers not only to the ultimate centers against which costs are finally lodged such as research agreements, but also to other established cost centers such as the individual accounts for recording particular objects or items of expense, and the separate account groupings designed to record the expenses incurred by individual organizational units, functions, projects and the like. In general, the administrative functions and service activities described in paragraph VI are identifiable as separate cost centers, and the expenses associated with such centers become eligible in due course for distribution as indirect costs of research agreements and other ultimate cost centers.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Application to Research Agreements</HD>
              <P>Identifiable benefit to the research work rather than the nature of the goods and services involved is the determining factor in distinguishing direct from indirect costs of research agreements. Typical of transactions chargeable to a research agreement as direct costs are the compensation of employees for the time or effort devoted to the performance of work under the research agreement, including related staff benefit and pension plan costs to the extent that such items are consistently accorded to all employees and treated by the hospital as direct rather than indirect costs (see paragraph E.2.d(2)); the costs of materials consumed or expended in the performance of such work; and other items of expense incurred for the research agreement, such as extraordinary utility consumption. The cost of materials supplied from stock or services rendered by specialized facilities or other institutional service operations may be included as direct costs of research agreements provided such items are consistently treated by the institution as direct rather than indirect costs and are charged under a recognized method of costing or pricing designed to recover only the actual direct and indirect costs of such material or service and conforming to generally accepted cost accounting practices consistently followed by the institution.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">E. Indirect Costs</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. General</HD>
              <P>Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or joint objectives, and thus are not readily subject to treatment as direct costs of research agreements or other ultimate or revenue producing cost centers. In hospitals such costs normally are classified but not necessarily restricted to the following functional categories: Depreciation; Administrative and General (including fringe benefits if not charged directly); Operation of Plant; Maintenance of Plant; Laundry and Linen Service; Housekeeping; Dietary; Maintenance of Personnel; and Medical Records and Library.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Criteria for Distribution</HD>
              <P>a. <E T="03">Base period.</E>
              </P>
              <P>A base period for distribution of indirect costs is the period during which such costs are incurred and accumulated for distribution to work performed within that period. The base period normally should coincide with the fiscal year established by the hospital, but in any event the base period should be so selected as to avoid inequities in the distribution of costs.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Need for cost groupings.</E>
              </P>
              <P>The overall objective of the allocation process is to distribute the indirect costs described in paragraph F. to organized research, patient care, instruction and training, and other hospital activities in reasonable proportions consistent with the nature and extent of the use of the hospital's resources by research personnel, medical staff, patients, students, and other personnel or organizations. In order to achieve this objective with reasonable precision, it may be necessary to provide for selective distribution by establishing separate groupings of cost within one or more of the functional categories of indirect costs referred to in paragraph E.1. In general, the cost groupings established within a functional category should constitute, in each case, a pool of those items of expense that are considered to be of like character in terms of their relative contribution to (or degree of remoteness from) the particular cost centers to which distribution is appropriate. Each such pool or cost grouping should then be distributed individually to the related cost centers, using the distribution base or method most appropriate in the light of the guides set out in 2.c. below. While this paragraph places primary emphasis on a step-down method of indirect cost computation, paragraph H. provides an alternate method which may be used under certain conditions.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Selection of distribution method.</E>
              </P>

              <P>Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the method or base to be used in distributing to related cost centers the expenses assembled under each of the individual cost groups established as indicated under 2.b. above. Where a distribution can be made by assignment of a cost grouping directly to the area benefited, the distribution should be made in that manner. Care should be given, however, to eliminate similar or <PRTPAGE P="386"/>duplicative costs from any other distribution made to this area. Where the expenses under a cost grouping are more general in nature, the distribution to related cost centers should be made through use of a selected base which will produce results which are equitable to both the Government and the hospital. In general, any cost element or cost-related factor associated with the hospital's work is potentially adaptable for use as a distribution base provided:</P>
              <P>(1) It can readily be expressed in terms of dollars or other quantitative measure (total direct expenditures, direct salaries, man-hours applied, square feet utilized, hours of usage, number of documents processed, population served, and the like); and</P>
              <P>(2) It is common to the related cost centers during the base period. The essential consideration in selection of the distribution base in each instance is that it be the one best suited for assigning the pool of costs to related cost centers in accord with the relative benefits derived; the traceable cause and effect relationship; or logic and reason, where neither benefit nor cause and effect relationship is determinable.</P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">General consideration on cost groupings.</E>
              </P>
              <P>The extent to which separate cost groupings and selective distribution would be appropriate at a hospital is a matter of judgment to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Typical situations which may warrant the establishment of two or more separate cost groups (based on account classification or analysis) within a functional category include but are not limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Where certain items or categories of expense relate solely to one of the major divisions of the hospital (patient care, sponsored research, instruction and training, or other hospital activities) or to any two but not all, such expenses should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for direct assignment or selective distribution in accordance with the guides provided in 2.b. and 2.c.above.</P>
              <P>(2) Where any types of expense ordinary treated as indirect cost as outlined in paragraph are charged to research agreements as direct costs, the similar type expenses applicable to other activities of the institution must through separate cost grouping be excluded from the indirect costs allocable to research agreements.</P>
              <P>(3) Where it is determined that certain expenses are for the support of a service unit or facility whose output is susceptible of measurement on a workload or other quantitative basis, such expenses should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for distribution on such basis to organized research and other hospital activities.</P>
              <P>(4) Where organized activities (including identifiable segments of organized research as well as the activities cited inB.5.) provide their own purchasing, personnel administration, building maintenance, or housekeeping or similar service, the distribution of such elements of indirect cost to such activities should be accomplished through cost grouping which includes only that portion of central indirect costs (such as for overall management) which are properly allocable to such activities.</P>
              <P>(5) Where the hospital elects to treat as indirect charges the costs of pension plans and other staff benefits, such costs should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for selective distribution to related cost centers, including organized research.</P>
              <P>(6) Where the hospital is affiliated with a medical school or some other institution which performs organized research on the hospital's premises, every effort should be made to establish separate cost groupings in the Administrative and General or other applicable category which will reasonably reflect the use of services and facilities by such research. (See also paragraph.)</P>
              <P>e. <E T="03">Materiality.</E>
              </P>
              <P>Where it is determined that the use of separate cost groupings and selective distribution are necessary to produce equitable results, the number of such separate cost groupings within a functional category should be held within practical limits, after taking into consideration the materiality of the amounts involved and the degree of precision attainable through less selective methods of distribution.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Administration of Limitations on Allowances for Indirect Costs</HD>
              <P>a. Research grants may be subject to laws and/or administrative regulations that limit the allowance for indirect costs under each such grant to a stated percentage of the direct costs allowed. Agencies that sponsor such grants will establish procedures which will assure that:</P>
              <P>(1) The terms and amount authorized in each case conform with the provisions of paragraphs C, E, and I of these principles as they apply to matters involving the consistent treatment and allowability of individual items of cost; and</P>
              <P>(2) The amount actually allowed for indirect costs under each such research grant does not exceed the maximum allowable under the limitation or the amount otherwise allowable under these principles, whichever is the smaller.</P>
              <P>b. Where the actual allowance for indirect costs on any research grant must be restricted to the smaller of the two alternative amounts referred to in 3.a. above, such alternative amounts should be determined in accordance with the following guides:</P>

              <P>(1) The maximum allowable under the limitation should be established by applying the stated percentage to a direct cost base which <PRTPAGE P="387"/>shall include all items of expenditure authorized by the sponsoring agency for inclusion as part of the total cost for the direct benefit of the work under the grant; and</P>
              <P>(2) The amount otherwise allowable under these principles should be established by applying the current institutional indirect cost rate to those elements of direct cost which were included in the base on which the rate was computed.</P>
              <P>c. When the maximum amount allowable under a statutory limitation or the terms of a research agreement is less than the amount otherwise allocable as indirect costs under these principles, the amount not recoverable as indirect costs under the research agreement involved may not be shifted to other research agreements.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">F. Identification and Assignment of Indirect Costs</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Depreciation or Use Charge</HD>
              <P>a. The expenses under this heading should include depreciation (as defined in paragraph I.2.i(1)) on buildings, fixed equipment, and movable equipment, except to the extent purchased through federal funds. Where adequate records for the recording of depreciation are not available, a use charge may be substituted for depreciation (See paragraph I.2.)</P>
              <P>b. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to applicable cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides set forth in paragraph E.2., on a basis that gives primary emphasis to (a) space utilization with respect to depreciation on buildings and fixed equipment; and (b) specific identification of assets and their use with respect to movable equipment as it relates to patient care, organized research, instruction and training, and other hospital activities. Where such records are not sufficient for the purpose of the foregoing, reasonable estimates will suffice as a means for effecting distribution of the amounts involved.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Administration and General Expenses</HD>

              <P>a.

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">G. Determination and Application of Indirect Cost Rate or Rates</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Indirect Cost Pools</HD>
              <P>a. Subject to b. below, indirect costs allocated to organized research should be treated as a common pool, and the costs in such common pool should be distributed to individual research agreements benefiting therefrom on a single rate basis.</P>
              <P>b. In some instances a single rate basis for use on all government research at a hospital may not be appropriate since it would not take into account those different environmental factors which may affect substantially the indirect costs applicable to a particular segment of government research at the institution. For this purpose, a particular segment of government research may be that performed under a single research agreement or it may consist of research under a group of research agreements performed in a common environment. The environmental factors are not limited to the physical location of the work. Other important factors are the level of the administrative support required, the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, the scientific disciplines or technical skills involved, the organizational arrangements used, or any combination thereof. Where a particular segment of government research is performed within an environment which appears to generate a significantly different level of indirect costs, provision should be made for a separate indirect cost pool applicable to such work. An example of this differential may be in the development of a separate indirect cost pool for a clinical research center grant. The separate indirect cost pool should be developed during the course of the regular distribution process, and the separate indirect cost rate resulting therefrom should be utilized provided it is determined that:</P>
              <P>(1) Such indirect cost rate differs significantly from that which would have obtained under a. above; and</P>
              <P>(2) The volume of research work to which such rate would apply is material in relation to other government research at the institution.</P>
              <P>c. It is a common practice for grants or contracts awarded to other institutions, typically University Schools of Medicine, to be performed on hospital premises. In these cases the hospital should develop a separate indirect cost pool applicable to the work under such grants or contracts. This pool should be developed by a selective distribution of only those indirect cost categories which benefit the work performed by the other institution, within the practical limits dictated by available data and the materiality of the amounts involved. Hospital costs determined to be allocable to grants or contracts awarded to another institution may not be recovered as a cost of grants or contracts awarded directly to the hospital.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. The Distribution Base</HD>
              <P>Preferably, indirect costs allocated to organized research should be distributed to applicable research agreements on the basis of direct salaries and wages. However, where the use of salaries and wages results in an inequitable allocation of costs to the research agreements, total direct costs or a variation thereof, may be used in lieu of salaries and wages. Regardless of the base used, an indirect cost rate should be determined for each of the separate indirect cost pools developed pursuant to paragraph G.1. The rate in each case should be stated as the percentage which the amount of the particular indirect cost pool is of the total direct salaries and wages (or other base selected) for all research agreements identified with such a pool.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Negotiated Lump Sum for Overhead</HD>

              <P>A negotiated fixed amount in lieu of indirect costs may be appropriate for self-contained or off-campus research activities where the benefits derived from a hospital's indirect services cannot be readily determined. Such amount negotiated in lieu of indirect costs will be treated as an offset to the appropriate indirect cost pool after allocation to patient care, organized research, instruction and training, and other hospital activities. The base on which such remaining expenses are allocated should be appropriately adjusted.<PRTPAGE P="390"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Predetermined Overhead Rates</HD>
              <P>The utilization of predetermined fixed overhead rates may offer potential advantages in the administration of research agreements by facilitating the preparation of research budgets and permitting more expeditious close out of the agreements when the work is completed. Therefore, to the extent allowed by law, consideration may be given to the negotiation of predetermined fixed rates in those situations where the cost experience and other pertinent factors available are deemed sufficient to enable the Government and the hospital to reach a reasonable conclusion as to the probable level of the indirect cost rate for the ensuing accounting period.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">H. Simplified Method for Small Institutions</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. General</HD>
              <P>a. Where the total direct cost of all government-sponsored research and development work at a hospital in a year is minimal, the use of the abbreviated procedure described in paragraph H.2. below may be acceptable in the determination of allowable indirect costs. This method may also be used to initially determine a provisional indirect cost rate for hospitals that have not previously established a rate. Under this abbreviated procedure, data taken directly from the institution's most recent annual financial report and immediately available supporting information will be utilized as a basis for determining the indirect cost rate applicable to research agreements at the institution.</P>
              <P>b. The rigid formula approach provided under the abbreviated procedure has limitations which may preclude its use at some hospitals either because the minimum data required for this purpose are not readily available or because the application of the abbreviated procedure to the available data produces results which appear inequitable to the Government or the hospital. In any such case, indirect costs should be determined through use of the regular procedure rather than the abbreviated procedure.</P>
              <P>c. In certain instances where the total direct cost of all government-sponsored research and development work at the hospital is more than minimal, the abbreviated procedure may be used if prior permission is obtained. This alternative will be granted only in those cases where it can be demonstrated that the step-down technique cannot be followed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Abbreviated Procedure</HD>
              <P>a. Total expenditures as taken from the most recent annual financial report will be adjusted by eliminating from further consideration expenditures for capital items as defined in paragraph I.2.d. and unallowable costs as defined under various headings in paragraph I. and paragraph C.5.</P>
              <P>b. Total expenditures as adjusted under the foregoing will then be distributed among (1) expenditures applicable to administrative and general overhead functions, (2) expenditures applicable to all other overhead functions, and (3) expenditures for all other purposes. The first group shall include amounts associated with the functional categories, Administration and General, and Dietary, as defined in paragraphs F.2. and 7. The second group shall include Depreciation, Operation of Plant, Maintenance of Plant, and Housekeeping. The third group—expenditures for all other purposes—shall include the amounts applicable to all other activities, namely, patient care, organized research, instruction and training, and other hospital activities as defined under paragraph B.5. For the purposes of this section, the functional categories of Laundry and Linen, Maintenance of Personnel, and Medical Records and Library as defined in paragraph E. shall be considered as expenditures for all other purposes.</P>
              <P>c. The expenditures distributed to the first two groups in paragraph H.2.b. should then be adjusted by those receipts or negative expenditure types of transactions which tend to reduce expense items allocable to research agreements as indirect costs. Examples of such receipts or negative expenditures are itemized in paragraph C.5.a.</P>
              <P>d. In applying the procedures in paragraphs H.2.a and 2.b, the cost of unallowable activities such as Gift Shop, Investment Property Management, Fund Raising, and Public Relations, when they benefit from the hospital's indirect cost services, should be treated as expenditures for all other purposes. Such activities are presumed to benefit from the hospital's indirect cost services when they include salaries of personnel working in the hospital. When they do not include such salaries, they should be eliminated from the indirect cost rate computation.</P>
              <P>e. The indirect cost rate will then be computed in two stages. The first stage requires the computation of an Administrative and General rate component. This is done by applying a ratio of research direct costs over total direct costs to the Administrative and General pool developed under paragraphs H.2.b and 2.c. above. The resultant amount—that which is allocable to research—is divided by the direct research cost base. The second stage requires the computation of an All Other Indirect Cost rate component. This is done by applying a ratio of research direct space over total direct space to All Other Indirect Cost pool developed under paragraphs H.2.b. and 2.c. above. The resultant amount—that which is allocable to research—is divided by the direct research cost base.</P>

              <P>The total of the two rate components will be the institution's indirect cost rate. For <PRTPAGE P="391"/>the purposes of this section, the research direct cost or space and total direct cost or space will be that cost or space identified with the functional categories classified under Expenditures for all other purposes under paragraph H.2.b.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">I. General Standards for Selected Items of Cost</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. General</HD>
              <P>This section provides standards to be applied in establishing the allowability of certain items involved in determining cost. These standards should apply irrespective of whether a particular item of cost is properly treated as direct cost or indirect cost. Failure to mention a particular item of cost in the standards is not intended to imply that it is either allowable or unallowable; rather, determination as to allowability in each case should be based on the treatment or standards provided for similar or related items of cost. In case of discrepancy between the provisions of a specific research agreement and the applicable standards provided, the provisions of the research agreement should govern. However, in some cases advance understandings should be reached on particular cost items in order that the full costs of research be supported. The extent of allowability of the selected items of cost covered in this section has been stated to apply broadly to many accounting systems in varying environmental situations. Thus, as to any given research agreement, the reasonableness and allocability of certain items of costs may be difficult to determine, particularly in connection with hospitals which have medical school or other affiliations. In order to avoid possible subsequent disallowance or dispute based on unreasonableness or nonallocability, it is important that prospective recipients of federal funds, particularly those whose work is predominantly or substantially with the Government, seek agreement with the Government in advance of the incurrence of special or unusual costs in categories where reasonableness or allocability are difficult to determine. Such agreement may also be initiated by the Government. Any such agreement should be incorporated in the research agreement itself. However, the absence of such an advance agreement on any element of cost will not in itself serve to make that element either allowable or unallowable. Examples of costs on which advance agreements may be particularly important are:</P>
              <P>a. Facilities costs, such as;</P>
              <P>(1) Depreciation</P>
              <P>(2) Rental</P>
              <P>(3) Use charges for fully depreciated assets</P>
              <P>(4) Idle facilities and idle capacity</P>
              <P>(5) Plant reconversion</P>
              <P>(6) Extraordinary or deferred maintenance and repair</P>
              <P>(7) Acquisition of automatic data processing equipment.</P>
              <P>b. Pre-award costs</P>
              <P>c. Non-hospital professional activities</P>
              <P>d. Self-insurance</P>
              <P>e. Support services charged directly (computer services, printing and duplicating services, etc.)</P>
              <P>f. Employee compensation, travel, and other personnel costs, including:</P>
              <P>(1) Compensation for personal service, including wages and salaries, bonuses and incentives, premium payments, pay for time not worked, and supplementary compensation and benefits, such as pension and retirement, group insurance, severance pay plans, and other forms of compensation;</P>
              <P>(2) Morale, health, welfare, and food service and dormitory costs.</P>
              <P>(3) Training and education costs.</P>
              <P>(4) Relocation costs, including special or mass personnel movement.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Selected Items</HD>
              <P>a. <E T="03">Advertising costs.</E> The term advertising costs means the costs of advertising media and corollary administrative costs. Advertising media include magazines, newspapers, radio and television programs, direct mail, exhibits, and the like. The only advertising costs allowable are those which are solely for:</P>
              <P>(1) The recruitment of persons required for the performance by the institution of obligations arising under the research agreement, when considered in conjunction with all other recruitment costs as set forth in paragraph I.2.hh;</P>
              <P>(2) The procurement of scarce items for the performance of the research agreement; or</P>
              <P>(3) The disposal of scrap or surplus materials acquired in the performance of the research agreement.</P>
              <P>Costs of this nature, if incurred for more than one research agreement or for both research agreement work and other work of the institution, are allowable to the extent that the principles in paragraphs D. and E. are observed.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Bad debts.</E> Losses arising from uncollectible accounts and other claims and related collection and legal costs are unallowable except that a bad debt may be included as a direct cost of the research agreement to the extent that it is caused by a research patient and approved by the awarding agency. This inclusion is only intended to cover the situation of the patient admitted for research purposes who subsequently or in conjunction with the research receives clinical care for which a charge is made to the patient. If, after exhausting all means of collecting these charges, a bad debt results, it may be considered an appropriate charge to the research agreement.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Bonding costs.</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="392"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Bonding costs arise when the Government requires assurance against financial loss to itself or others by reason of the act or default of the hospital. They arise also in instances where the hospital requires similar assurance.</P>
              <P>Included are such types as bid, performance, payment, advance payment, infringement, and fidelity bonds.</P>
              <P>(2) Costs of bonding required pursuant to the terms of the research agreement are allowable.</P>
              <P>(3) Costs of bonding required by the hospital in the general conduct of its business are allowable to the extent that such bonding is in accordance with sound business practice and the rates and premiums are reasonable under the circumstances.</P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">Capital expenditures.</E> The costs of equipment, buildings, and repairs which materially increase the value or useful life of buildings or equipment should be capitalized and are unallowable except as provided for in the research agreement.</P>
              <P>e. <E T="03">Civil defense costs.</E> Civil defense costs are those incurred in planning for, and the protection of life and property against the possible effects of enemy attack. Reasonable costs of civil defense measures (including costs in excess of normal plant protection costs, first-aid training and supplies, fire-fighting training, posting of additional exit notices and directions, and other approved civil defense measures) undertaken on the institution's premises pursuant to suggestions or requirements of civil defense authorities are allowable when distributed to all activities of the institution. Capital expenditures for civil defense purposes will not be allowed, but a use allowance or depreciation may be permitted in accordance with provisions set forth elsewhere. Costs of local civil defense projects not on the institution's premises are unallowable.</P>
              <P>f. <E T="03">Communication costs.</E> Costs incurred for telephone services, local and long distance telephone calls, telegrams, radiograms, postage, and the like are allowable.</P>
              <P>g. <E T="03">Compensation for personal services</E>.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">(1) General</HD>
              <P>Compensation for personal services covers all remuneration paid currently or accrued to employees of the hospital for services rendered during the period of performance under government research agreements. Such remuneration includes salaries, wages, staff benefits (see paragraph I.2.j.), and pension plan costs (see paragraph I.2.y.). The costs of such remuneration are allowable to the extent that the total compensation to individual employees is reasonable for the services rendered and conforms to the established policy of the institution consistently applied, and provided that the charges for work performed directly on government research agreements and for other work allocable as indirect costs to sponsored research are determined and supported as hereinafter provided. For non-profit, non-proprietary institutions, where federally supported programs constitute less than a preponderance of the activity at the institution the primary test of reasonableness will be to require that the institution's compensation policies be applied consistently both to federally-sponsored and non-sponsored activities alike. However, where special circumstances so dictate a contractual clause may be utilized which calls for application of the test of comparability in determining the reasonableness of compensation.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">(2) Payroll Distribution</HD>
              <P>Amounts charged to organized research for personal services, regardless of whether treated as direct costs or allocated as indirect costs, will be based on hospital payrolls which have been approved and documented in accordance with generally accepted hospital practices. In order to develop necessary direct and indirect allocations of cost, supplementary data on time or effort as provided in paragraph (3) below, normally need be required only for individuals whose compensation is properly chargeable to two or more research agreements or to two or more of the following broad functional categories: (i) Patient care; (ii) organized research; (iii) instruction and training; (iv) indirect activities as defined in paragraph E.1.; or (v) other hospital activities as defined in paragraph B.5.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">(3) Reporting Time or Effort</HD>
              <P>Charges for salaries and wages of individuals other than members of the professional staff will be supported by daily time and attendance and payroll distribution records. For members of the professional staff, current and reasonable estimates of the percentage distribution of their total effort may be used as support in the absence of actual time records. The term professional staff for purposes of this section includes physicians, research associates, and other personnel performing work at responsible levels of activities. These personnel normally fulfill duties, the competent performance of which usually requires persons possessing degrees from accredited institutions of higher learning and/or state licensure. In order to qualify as current and reasonable, estimates must be made no later than one month (though not necessarily a calendar month) after the month in which the services were performed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">(4) Preparation of Estimates of Effort</HD>

              <P>Where required under paragraph (3) above, estimates of effort spent by a member of the professional staff on each research agreement should be prepared by the individual <PRTPAGE P="393"/>who performed the services or by a responsible individual such as a department head or supervisor having first-hand knowledge of the services performed on each research agreement. Estimates must show the allocation of effort between organized research and all other hospital activities in terms of the percentage of total effort devoted to each of the broad functional categories referred to in (2) above. The estimate of effort spent on a research agreement may include a reasonable amount of time spent in activities contributing and intimately related to work under the agreement, such as preparing and delivering special lectures about specific aspects of the ongoing research, writing research reports and articles, participating in appropriate research seminars, consulting with colleagues with respect to related research, and attending appropriate scientific meetings and conferences. The term “all other hospital activities” would include departmental research, administration, committee work, and public services undertaken on behalf of the hospital.</P>

              <P>Estimates determined before the performance of services, such as budget estimates on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis do not qualify as estimates of effort spent.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">(6) Non-Hospital Professional Activities</HD>
              <P>A hospital must not alter or waive hospital-wide policies and practices dealing with the permissible extent of professional services over and above those traditionally performed without extra hospital compensation, unless such arrangements are specifically authorized by the sponsoring agency. Where hospital-wide policies do not adequately define the permissible extent of consultantships or other non-hospital activities undertaken for extra pay, the Government may require that the effort of professional staff working under research agreements be allocated as between (i) hospital activities, and (ii) non-hospital professional activities. If the sponsoring agency should consider the extent of non-hospital professional effort excessive, appropriate arrangements governing compensation will be negotiated on a case by case basis.</P>

              </P>
              <P>Contributions to a contingency reserve or any similar provisions made for events the occurrence of which cannot be foretold with certainty as to time, intensity, or with an assurance of their happening, are unallowable.</P>
              <P>i. <E T="03">Depreciation and use allowances.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Hospitals may be compensated for the use of buildings, capital improvements and usable equipment on hand through depreciation or use allowances. Depreciation is a charge to current operations which distributes the cost of a tangible capital asset, less estimated residual value, over the estimated useful life of the asset in a systematic and logical manner. It does not involve a process of valuation. Useful life has reference to the prospective period of economic usefulness in the particular hospital's operations as distinguished from physical life. Use allowances are the means of allowing compensation when depreciation or other equivalent costs are not considered.</P>
              <P>(2) Due consideration will be given to government-furnished research facilities utilized by the institution when computing use allowances and/or depreciation if the government-furnished research facilities are material in amount. Computation of the use allowance and/or depreciation will exclude both the cost or any portion of the cost of grounds, buildings and equipment borne by or donated by the Federal Government, irrespective of where title was originally vested or where it presently resides, and secondly, the cost of grounds. Capital expenditures for land improvements (paved areas, fences, streets, sidewalks, utility conduits, and similar improvements not already included in the cost of buildings) are allowable provided the systematic amortization of such capital expenditures has been provided in the institution's books of accounts, based on reasonable determinations of the probable useful lives of the individual items involved, and the share allocated to organized research is developed from the amount thus amortized for the base period involved.</P>
              <P>(3) Normal depreciation on a hospital's plant, equipment, and other capital facilities, except as excluded by (4) below, is an allowable element of research cost provided that the amount thereof is computed:</P>
              <P>i. Upon the property cost basis used by the hospital for Federal Income Tax purposes (See section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954); or</P>
              <P>ii. In the case of non-profit or tax exempt organizations, upon a property cost basis which could have been used by the hospital for Federal Income Tax purposes, had such hospital been subject to the payment of income tax; and in either case</P>
              <P>iii. By the consistent application to the assets concerned of any generally accepted accounting method, and subject to the limitations of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended, including—</P>
              <P>(a) The straight line method;</P>

              <P>(b) The declining balance method, using a rate not exceeding twice the rate which <PRTPAGE P="394"/>would have been used had the annual allowance been computed under the method described in (a) above;</P>
              <P>(c) The sum of the years-digits method; and</P>
              <P>(d) Any other consistent method productive of an annual allowance which, when added to all allowances for the period commencing with the use of the property and including the current year, does not during the first two-thirds of the useful life of the property exceed the total of such allowances which would have been used had such allowances been computed under the method described in (b) above.</P>
              <P>(4) Where the depreciation method is followed, adequate property records must be maintained. The period of useful service (service life) established in each case for usable capital assets must be determined on a realistic basis which takes into consideration such factors as type of construction, nature of the equipment used, technological developments in the particular research area, and the renewal and replacement policies followed for the individual items or classes of assets involved. Where the depreciation method is introduced for application to assets acquired in prior years, the annual charges therefrom must not exceed the amounts that would have resulted had the depreciation method been in effect from the date of acquisition of such assets.</P>
              <P>(5) Depreciation on idle or excess facilities shall not be allowed except on such facilities as are reasonably necessary for standby purposes.</P>
              <P>(6) Where an institution elects to go on a depreciation basis for a particular class of assets, no depreciation, rental or use charge may be allowed on any such assets that would be viewed as fully depreciated; provided, however, that reasonable use charges may be negotiated for any such assets if warranted after taking into consideration the cost of the facility or item involved, the estimated useful life remaining at time of negotiation, the actual replacement policy followed in the light of service lives used for calculating depreciation, the effect of any increased maintenance charges or decreased efficiency due to age, and any other factors pertinent to the utilization of the facility or item for the purpose contemplated.</P>
              <P>(7) Hospitals which choose a depreciation allowance for assets purchased prior to 1966 based on a percentage of operating costs in lieu of normal depreciation for purposes of reimbursement under Pub. L. 89-97 (Medicare) shall utilize that method for determining depreciation applicable to organized research.</P>
              <P>The operating costs to be used are the lower of the hospital's 1965 operating costs or the hospital's current year's allowable costs. The percent to be applied is 5 percent starting with the year 1966-67, with such percentage being uniformity reduced by one-half percent each succeeding year. The allowance based on operating costs is in addition to regular depreciation on assets acquired after 1965. However, the combined amount of such allowance on pre-1966 assets and the allowance for actual depreciation on assets acquired after 1965 may not exceed 6 percent of the hospital's allowable cost for the current year. After total depreciation has been computed, allocation methods are used to determine the share attributable to organized research.</P>
              <P>For purposes of this section, <E T="03">Operating Costs</E> means the total costs incurred by the hospital in operating the institution, and includes patient care, research, and other activities. <E T="03">Allowable Costs</E> means operating costs less unallowable costs as defined in these principles; by the application of allocation methods to the total amount of such allowable costs, the share attributable to Federally-sponsored research is determined.</P>
              <P>A hospital which elects to use this procedure under Pub. L. 89-97 and subsequently changes to an actual depreciation basis on pre-1966 assets in accordance with the option afforded under the Medicare program shall simultaneously change to an actual depreciation basis for organized research.</P>
              <P>Where the hospital desires to change to actual depreciation but either has no historical cost records or has incomplete records, the determination of historical cost could be made through appropriate means involving expert consultation with the determination being subject to review and approval by the Department of Health and Human Services.</P>

              <P>(8) Where the use allowance method is followed, the use allowance for buildings and improvements will be computed at an annual rate not exceeding two percent of acquisition cost. The use allowance for equipment will be computed at an annual rate not exceeding six and two-thirds percent of acquisition cost of usable equipment in those cases where the institution maintains current records with respect to such equipment on hand. Where the institution's records reflect only the cost (actual or estimated) of the original complement of equipment, the use allowance will be computed at an annual rate not exceeding ten percent of such cost. Original complement for this purpose means the complement of equipment initially placed in buildings to perform the functions currently being performed in such buildings; however, where a permanent change in the function of a building takes place, a redetermination of the original complement of equipment may be made at that time to establish a new original complement. In those cases where no equipment records are maintained, the institution will justify a reasonable estimate of the acquisition cost of usable equipment <PRTPAGE P="395"/>which may be used to compute the use allowance at an annual rate not exceeding six and two-thirds percent of such estimate.</P>
              <P>(9) Depreciation and/or use charges should usually be allocated to research and other activities as an indirect cost.</P>
              <P>j. <E T="03">Employee morale, health, and welfare costs and credits.</E>
              </P>
              <P>The costs of house publications, health or first-aid benefits, recreational activities, employees' counseling services, and other expenses incurred in accordance with the hospital's established practice or custom for the improvement of working conditions, employer-employee relations, employee morale, and employee performance, are allowable. Such costs will be equitably apportioned to all activities of the hospital. Income generated from any of these activities will be credited to the cost thereof unless such income has been irrevocably set over to employee welfare organizations.</P>
              <P>k. <E T="03">Entertainment costs.</E>
              </P>
              <P>Except as pertains to j. above, costs incurred for amusement, social activities, entertainment, and any items relating thereto, such as meals, lodging, rentals, transportation, and gratuities are unallowable.</P>

              </P>
              <P>The cost of equipment or other facilities are allowable on a direct charge basis where such purchases are approved by the sponsoring agency concerned or provided for by the terms of the research agreement.</P>

              </P>
              <P>Costs resulting from violations of, or failure of the institution to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations are unallowable except when incurred as a result of compliance with specific provisions of the research agreement, or instructions in writing from the awarding agency.</P>
              <P>n. <E T="03">Insurance and indemnification.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Costs of insurance required or approved and maintained pursuant to the research agreement are allowable.</P>
              <P>(2) Costs of other insurance maintained by the hospital in connection with the general conduct of its activities are allowable subject to the following limitations: (i) Types and extent and cost of coverage must be in accordance with sound institutional practice; (ii) costs of insurance or of any contributions to any reserve covering the risk of loss of or damage to government owned property are unallowable except to the extent that the Government has specifically required or approved such costs; and (iii) costs of insurance on the lives of officers or trustees are unallowable except where such insurance is part of an employee plan which is not unduly restricted.</P>
              <P>(3) Contributions to a reserve for an approved self-insurance program are allowable to the extent that the types of coverage, extent of coverage, and the rates and premiums would have been allowed had insurance been purchased to cover the risks. Such contributions are subject to prior approval of the Government.</P>
              <P>(4) Actual losses which could have been covered by permissible insurance (through an approved self-insurance program or otherwise) are unallowable unless expressly provided for in the research agreement, except that costs incurred because of losses not covered under nominal deductible insurance coverage provided in keeping with sound management practice as well as minor losses not covered by insurance such as spoilage, breakage and disappearance of small hand tools which occur in the ordinary course of operations are allowable.</P>
              <P>o. <E T="03">Interest, fund raising and investment management costs.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Costs incurred for interest on borrowed capital or temporary use of endowment funds, however represented, are unallowable.</P>

              </P>
              <P>Any excess of costs over income under any agreement or contract of any nature is unallowable. This includes, but is not limited to, the hospital's contributed portion by reason of cost-sharing agreements, under-recoveries through negotiation of flat amounts for overhead, or legal or administrative limitations.</P>
              <P>r. <E T="03">Maintenance and repair costs.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Costs necessary for the upkeep of property (including government property unless otherwise provided for), which neither add to the permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolong its intended life, but keep it in an efficient operating condition, are to be treated as follows:</P>
              <P>i. Normal maintenance and repair costs are allowable;</P>
              <P>ii. Extraordinary maintenance and repair costs are allowable, provided they are allocated to the periods to which applicable for purposes of determining research costs.</P>

              <P>(2) Expenditures for plant and equipment, including rehabilitation thereof, which according to generally accepted accounting principles as applied under the hospital's established policy, should be capitalized and <PRTPAGE P="396"/>subjected to depreciation, are allowable only on a depreciation basis.</P>

              </P>
              <P>Costs incurred for purchased materials, supplies and fabricated parts directly or indirectly related to the research agreement, are allowable. Purchases made specifically for the research agreement should be charged thereto at their actual prices after deducting all cash discounts, trade discounts, rebates, and allowances received by the institution. Withdrawals from general stores or stockrooms should be charged at their cost under any recognized method of pricing stores withdrawals conforming to sound accounting practices consistently followed by the hospital. Incoming transportation charges are a proper part of material cost. Direct material cost should include only the materials and supplies actually used for the performance of the research agreement, and due credit should be given for any excess materials retained or returned to vendors. Due credit should be given for all proceeds or value received for any scrap resulting from work under the research agreement. Where government donated or furnished material is used in performing the research agreement, such material will be used without charge.</P>

              </P>
              <P>The cost of routine and ancillary or special services to research patients is an allowable direct cost of research agreements.</P>
              <P>(1) Routine services shall include the costs of the regular room, dietary and nursing services, minor medical and surgical supplies and the use of equipment and facilities for which a separate charge is not customarily made.</P>
              <P>(2) Ancillary or special services are the services for which charges are customarily made in addition to routine services, such as operating rooms, anesthesia, laboratory, BMR-EKG, etc.</P>
              <P>(3) Patient care, whether expressed as a rate or an amount, shall be computed in a manner consistent with the procedures used to determine reimbursable costs under Pub. L. 89-97 (Medicare Program) as defined under the “Principles of Reimbursement For Provider Costs” published by the Social Security Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services. The allowability of specific categories of cost shall be in accordance with those principles rather than the principles for research contained herein. In the absence of participation in the Medicare program by a hospital, all references to the Medicare program in these principles shall be construed as meaning the Medicaid program.</P>
              <P>i. Once costs have been recognized as allowable, the indirect costs or general service center's cost shall be allocated (stepped-down) to special service centers, and all patient and nonpatient costs centers based upon actual services received or benefiting these centers.</P>

              <P>ii. After allocation, routine and ancillary costs shall be apportioned to scatter-bed research patients on the same basis as is used to apportion costs to Medicare patients, <E T="03">i.e.</E> using either the departmental method or the combination method, as those methods are defined by the Social Security Administration; except that final settlement shall be on a grant-by-grant basis. However, to the extent that the Social Security Administration has recognized any other method of cost apportionment, that method generally shall also be recognized as applicable to the determination of research patient care costs.</P>

              <P>iii. A cost center must be established on Medicare reimbursement forms for each discrete-bed unit grant award received by a hospital. Routine costs should be stepped-down to this line item(s) in the normal course of stepping-down costs under Medicare/Medicaid requirements. However, in stepping-down routine costs, consideration must be given to preventing a step-down of those costs to discrete-bed unit line items that have already been paid for directly by the grant, such as bedside nursing costs. Ancillary costs allocable to research discrete-bed units shall be determined and proposed in accordance with paragraph w.(3).ii.<PRTPAGE P="397"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Where federally sponsored research programs provide specifically for the direct reimbursement of nursing, dietary, and other services, appropriate adjustment must be made to patient care costs to preclude duplication and/or misallocation of costs.</P>

Retainer fees to be allowable must be reasonably supported by evidence of services rendered.</P>
              <P>(2) Factors to be considered in determining the allowability of costs in a particular case include (i) the past pattern of such costs, particularly in the years prior to the award of government research agreements on the institution's total activity; (ii) the nature and scope of managerial services expected of the institution's own organizations; and (iii) whether the proportion of government work to the hospital's total activity is such as to influence the institution in favor of incurring the cost, particularly where the services rendered are not of a continuing nature and have little relationship to work under government research agreements.</P>
              <P>(3) Costs of legal, accounting and consulting services, and related costs incurred in connection with organization and reorganization or the prosecution of claims against the Government are unallowable. Costs of legal, accounting and consulting services, and related costs incurred in connection with patent infringement litigation are unallowable unless otherwise provided for in the research agreement.</P>

              </P>
              <P>Proposal costs are the costs of preparing bids or proposals on potential government and non-government research agreements or projects, including the development of technical data and cost data necessary to support the institution's bids or proposals. Proposal costs of the current accounting period of both successful and unsuccessful bids and proposals normally should be treated as indirect costs and allocated currently to all activities of the institution, and no proposal costs of past accounting periods will be allocable in the current period to the government research agreement. However, the institution's established practices may be to treat proposal costs by some other recognized method. Regardless of the methods used, the results obtained may be accepted only if found to be reasonable and equitable.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(1) Rental costs of land, building, and equipment and other personal property are allowable if the rates are reasonable in light of such factors as rental costs of comparable facilities and market conditions in the area, the type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the facilities leased, options available, and other provisions of the rental agreement. Application of these factors, in situations where rentals are extensively used, may involve among other considerations comparison of rental costs with the amount which the hospital would have received had it owned the facilities.</P>
              <P>(2) Charges in the nature of rent between organizations having a legal or other affiliation or arrangement such as hospitals, medical schools, foundations, etc., are allowable to the extent such charges do not exceed the normal costs of ownership such as depreciation, taxes, insurance, and maintenance, provided that no part of such costs shall duplicate any other allowed costs.</P>
              <P>(3) Unless otherwise specifically provided in the agreement, rental costs specified in sale and lease-back agreements incurred by hospitals through selling plant facilities to investment organizations such as insurance companies or to private investors, and concurrently leasing back the same facilities are allowable only to the extent that such rentals do not exceed the amount which the hospital would have received had it retained legal title to the facilities.</P>
              <P>jj. <E T="03">Royalties and other costs for use of patents.</E>
              </P>
              <P>Royalties on a patent or amortization of the cost of acquiring a patent or invention or rights thereto necessary for the proper performance of the research agreement and applicable to tasks or processes thereunder are allowable unless the Government has a license or the right to free use of the patent, the patent has been adjudicated to be invalid, or has been administratively determined to be invalid, the patent is considered to be unenforceable, or the patent has expired.</P>
              <P>kk. <E T="03">Severance pay.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Severance pay is compensation in addition to regular salaries and wages which is paid by a hospital to employees whose services are being terminated. Costs of severance pay are allowable only to the extent that such payments are required by law, by employer-employee agreement, by established policy that constitutes in effect an implied agreement on the institution's part, or by circumstances of the particular employment.</P>
              <P>(2) Severance payments that are due to normal, recurring turnover, and which otherwise meet the conditions of (a) above may be allowed provided the actual costs of such severance payments are regarded as expenses applicable to the current fiscal year and are equitably distributed among the institution's activities during that period.</P>
              <P>(3) Severance payments that are due to abnormal or mass terminations are of such conjectural nature that allowability must be determined on a case-by-case basis. However, the Government recognizes its obligation to participate to the extent of its fair share in any specific payment.</P>
              <P>ll. <E T="03">Specialized service facilities operated by a hospital.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) The costs of institutional services involving the use of highly complex and specialized facilities such as electronic computers and reactors are allowable provided the charges therefor meet the conditions of (2) or (3) below, and otherwise take into account any items of income or federal financing that qualify as applicable credits under paragraph C.5.</P>

              <P>(2) The costs of such hospital services normally will be charged directly to applicable research agreements based on actual usage or occupancy of the facilities at rates that (i) are designed to recover only actual costs of providing such services, and (ii) are applied on a nondiscriminatory basis as between organized research and other work of the hospital including commercial or accommodation sales and usage by the hospital for internal purposes. This would include use of such facilities as radiology, laboratories, <PRTPAGE P="399"/>maintenance men used for a special purpose, medical art, photography, etc.</P>
              <P>(3) In the absence of an acceptable arrangement for direct costing as provided in (2) above, the costs incurred for such institutional services may be assigned to research agreements as indirect costs, provided the methods used achieve substantially the same results. Such arrangements should be worked out in coordination with all government users of the facilities in order to assure equitable distribution of the indirect costs.</P>
              <P>mm. <E T="03">Special administrative costs.</E>
              </P>
              <P>Costs incurred for general public relations activities, catalogs, alumni activities, and similar services are unallowable.</P>
              <P>nn. <E T="03">Staff and/or employee benefits.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Staff and/or employee benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to employees during periods of authorized absences from the job such as for annual leave, sick leave, military leave and the like are allowable provided such costs are absorbed by all hospital activities including organized research in proportion to the relative amount of time or effort actually devoted to each.</P>
              <P>(2) Staff benefits in the form of employer contributions or expenses for Social Security taxes, employee insurance, Workmen's Compensation insurance, the Pension Plan (see paragraph I.2.y.), hospital costs or remission of hospital charges to the extent of costs for individual employees or their families, and the like are allowable provided such benefits are granted in accordance with established hospital policies, and provided such contributions and other expenses whether treated as indirect costs or an increment of direct labor costs are distributed to particular research agreements and other activities in a manner consistent with the pattern of benefits accruing to the individuals or groups of employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such research agreements and other activities.</P>
              <P>oo. <E T="03">Taxes.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) In general, taxes which the hospital is required to pay and which are paid or accrued in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and payments made to local governments in lieu of taxes which are commensurate with the local government services received are allowable except for (i) taxes from which exemptions are available to the hospital directly or which are available to the hospital based on an exemption afforded the Government and in the latter case when the sponsoring agency makes available the necessary exemption certificates, (ii) special assessments on land which represent capital improvements, and (iii) Federal Income Taxes.</P>
              <P>(2) Any refund of taxes, interest, or penalties, and any payment to the hospital of interest thereon attributable to taxes, interest or penalties, which were allowed as research agreement costs will be credited or paid to the Government in the manner directed by the Government provided any interest actually paid or credited to a hospital incident to a refund of tax, interest, and penalty will be paid or credited to the Government only to the extent that such interest accrued over the period during which the hospital had been reimbursed by the Government for the taxes, interest, and penalties.</P>
              <P>pp. <E T="03">Transportation costs.</E>
              </P>
              <P>Costs incurred for inbound freight, express, cartage, postage and other transportation services relating either to goods purchased, in process, or delivered are allowable. When such costs can readily be identified with the items involved, they may be charged directly as transportation costs or added to the cost of such items. Where identification with the material received cannot readily be made, inbound transportation costs may be charged to the appropriate indirect cost accounts if the institution follows a consistent equitable procedure in this respect. Outbound freight, if reimbursable under the terms of the research agreement, should be treated as a direct cost.</P>
              <P>qq. <E T="03">Travel costs.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Travel costs are the expenses for transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items incurred by employees who are in travel status on official business of the hospital. Such costs may be charged on an actual basis, on a per diem or mileage basis in lieu of actual costs incurred, or on a combination of the two provided the method used is applied to an entire trip and not to selected days of the trip, and results in charges consistent with those normally allowed by the institution in its regular operations.</P>
              <P>(2) Travel costs are allowable subject to (3) and (4) below when they are directly attributable to specific work under a research agreement or when they are incurred in the normal course of administration of the hospital or a department or research program thereof.</P>
              <P>(3) The difference in cost between first class air accommodations and less than first class air accommodations is unallowable except when less than first class air accommodations are not reasonably available to meet necessary mission requirements such as where less than first class accommodations would (i) require circuitous routing, (ii) require travel during unreasonable hours, (iii) greatly increase the duration of the flight, (iv) result in additional costs which would offset the transportation savings, or (v) offer accommodations which are not reasonably adequate for the medical needs of the traveler.</P>
              <P>(4) Costs of personnel movements of a special or mass nature are allowable only when authorized or approved in writing by the sponsoring agency or its authorized representative.</P>
              <P>rr. <E T="03">Termination costs applicable to contracts.</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="400"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Contract terminations generally give rise to the incurrence of costs or to the need for special treatment of costs which would not have arisen had the contract not been terminated. Items peculiar to termination are set forth below. They are to be used in conjunction with all other provisions of these principles in the case of contract termination.</P>
              <P>(2) The cost of common items of material reasonably usable on the hospital's other work will not be allowable unless the hospital submits evidence that it could not retain such items at cost without sustaining a loss. In deciding whether such items are reasonably usable on other work of the institution, consideration should be given to the hospital's plans for current scheduled work or activities including other research agreements. Contemporaneous purchases of common items by the hospital will be regarded as evidence that such items are reasonably usable on the hospital's other work. Any acceptance of common items as allowable to the terminated portion of the contract should be limited to the extent that the quantities of such items on hand, in transit, and on order are in excess of the reasonable quantitative requirement of other work.</P>
              <P>(3) If in a particular case, despite all reasonable efforts by the hospital, certain costs cannot be discontinued immediately after the effective date of termination, such costs are generally allowable within the limitations set forth in these principles, except that any such costs continuing after termination due to the negligent or willful failure of the hospital to discontinue such costs will be considered unacceptable.</P>
              <P>(4) Loss of useful value of special tooling and special machinery and equipment is generally allowable, provided (i) such special tooling, machinery or equipment is not reasonably capable of use in the other work of the hospital; (ii) the interest of the Government is protected by transfer of title or by other means deemed appropriate by the contracting officer; and (iii) the loss of useful value as to any one terminated contract is limited to that portion of the acquisition cost which bears the same ratio to the total acquisition cost as the terminated portion of the contract bears to the entire terminated contract and other government contracts for which the special tooling, special machinery or equipment was acquired.</P>
              <P>(5) Rental costs under unexpired leases are generally allowable where clearly shown to have been reasonably necessary for the performance of the terminated contract, less the residual value of such leases, if (i) the amount of such rental claimed does not exceed the reasonable use value of the property leased for the period of the contract and such further period as may be reasonable; and (ii) the hospital makes all reasonable efforts to terminate, assign, settle, or otherwise reduce the cost of such lease. There also may be included the cost of alterations of such leased property, provided such alterations were necessary for the performance of the contract and of reasonable restoration required by the provisions of the lease.</P>
              <P>(6) Settlement expenses including the following are generally allowable: (i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs reasonably necessary for the preparation and presentation to contracting officers of settlement claims and supporting data with respect to the terminated portion of the contract and the termination and settlement of subcontracts; and (ii) reasonable costs for the storage, transportation, protection, and disposition of property provided by the Government or acquired or produced by the institution for the contract.</P>
              <P>(7) Subcontractor claims including the allocable portion of claims which are common to the contract and to other work of the contractor are generally allowable.</P>
              <P>ss. <E T="03">Voluntary services.</E>
              </P>
              <P>The value of voluntary services provided by sisters or other members of religious orders is allowable provided that amounts do not exceed that paid other employees for similar work. Such amounts must be identifiable in the records of the hospital as a legal obligation of the hospital. This may be reflected by an agreement between the religious order and the hospital supported by evidence of payments to the order.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Letters of credit with the United States Treasury, issued by the Department to States or other grantees and contractors, are a convenient means for disbursing Federal funds to recipients of grant awards or contracts (recipient organizations) under the programs of this and other Executive Departments. The sound and efficient operation of the letter-of-credit system is dependent in large part upon the honesty, good faith, and responsible financial management of recipient organizations that receive funds pursuant to letters of credit. This part sets forth conditions that may prompt the Department to seek remedial action against a recipient organization operating under a letter of credit and the procedures that will be used to reach a final decision regarding the taking of remedial actions against a recipient organization.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 77.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Conditions that may give rise to remedial actions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>If the Department determines that any of the following conditions is present in a recipient organization's administration of a letter of credit, it may take remedial actions against the organization:</P>
            <P>(a) A recipient organization draws Federal funds through its letter of credit in excess of the aggregate grant award or contract authority currently available to it.</P>
            <P>(b) A recipient organization draws Federal funds for a particular program in excess of currently available grant award or contract authority for that program, even though the organization may not have exceeded its aggregate grant award or contract authority.</P>
            <P>(c) A recipient organization fails to file timely all reports and other data required by the Department in connection with its grant awards, contracts, or letter of credit.</P>
            <P>(d) A recipient organization accumulates, through its letter of credit or otherwise, excess amounts of Federal funds relative to its actual and immediate disbursement requirements.</P>
            <P>(e) A recipient organization's cash management system fails to comply with generally accepted accounting principles or Departmental regulations or demonstrates irregularities, misrepresentations, fraud, or abuse in its operation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Remedial actions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>If, after the conclusion of the procedures set forth in § 77.5 or § 77.6 the Department finds that one or more of the conditions set forth in § 77.3 is or has been present, the Department may take the following remedial actions against a recipient organization's use of its letter of credit:</P>
            <P>(a) The Department may place special limits, restrictions, or controls upon the recipient organization's use of its letter of credit.</P>
            <P>(b) The Department may require more frequent or more detailed financial reporting from the recipient organization.</P>
            <P>(c) The Department may suspend, reduce, or terminate the recipient organization's use of its letter of credit.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 77.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Remedial action procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Except as provided in § 77.6, the Department will use the following procedures whenever it seeks the remedial action specified in § 77.4.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice.</E> Prior to taking remedial action, the Department will provide the recipient organization written notice of its intended action setting forth both the legal and factual reasons therefor. Notice may be provided by certified or express mail, TWX, telegram, delivery, or similar means.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Opportunity to respond.</E> (1) The recipient organization has 30 days after <PRTPAGE P="403"/>receipt of the notice in which to submit to the Department a written statement setting forth any legal and factual reasons why it believes the proposed remedial action would be inappropriate. If no response is received by the Department within the 30-day period, the Department may make the proposed remedial action effective immediately. If a response opposing the taking of remedial action is received from the recipient organization within the 30-day period, no remedial action will be taken until a final decision has been reached under paragraph (c) of this section. (2) The Department may prepare a written reply to the recipient organization's response. Any such reply will be forwarded to the deciding official together with the notice sent to the recipient organization and the organization's response, and a copy of the reply will be served on the recipient organization.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Departmental decision.</E> The Department's decision to take remedial action under this part will be made by an official of the Department who had no involvement with the initial determination to seek remedial action. The deciding official may affirm, reverse, or modify the initial determination. In making the decision, the official will consider only the notice provided by the Department, the recipient organization's statement, the Department's reply, together with any other documents attached to them, and statements at any informal conference held pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The official's decision will be provided to the recipient organization in writing and will constitute the Department's final administrative action on the matter.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Informal conference.</E> If, in the judgment of the official designated to make a final decision, it would materially enhance his ability to resolve the matters in dispute, he may convene an informal conference to question or hear an oral presentation by the parties. If an informal conference is convened it will be transcribed.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Effect of decision.</E> The decision in a proceeding under this section affects only the recipient organization's obligations related to its letter of credit and does not determine the organization's ultimate liability with respect to improperly spent funds or other misconduct.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 77.6</SECTNO>

            <SUBJECT>Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the authority head, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.</P>
            <P>(b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the authority head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:</P>
            <P>(1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;</P>
            <P>(2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;</P>
            <P>(3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;</P>
            <P>(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;</P>
            <P>(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;</P>
            <P>(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;</P>
            <P>(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;</P>
            <P>(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;</P>
            <P>(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;</P>
            <P>(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;</P>
            <P>(11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;</P>
            <P>(12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;</P>
            <P>(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;</P>
            <P>(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;</P>
            <P>(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly; and</P>
            <P>(16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.</P>
            <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or the authority head from considering any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.</P>

            <P>(b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or deposition. Any such written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in § 79.22(a).</P>
            <P>(c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</P>
            <P>(d) The ALJ shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.</P>

            <P>This regulation applies to any program to which Federal financial assistance is authorized to be extended to a recipient under a law administered by the Department, including the Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A to this part. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of the regulation pursuant to an application approved prior to such effective date. This regulation does not apply to (a) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts, (b) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended before the effective date of this regulation, (c) the use of any assistance by any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary under any such program, or (d) any employment practice, under any such program, or any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in § 80.3. The fact that a type of Federal assistance is not listed in appendix A to this part shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list by notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible Department official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In the event a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the responsible Department official may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such <PRTPAGE P="424"/>mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Elementary and secondary schools.</E> The requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section with respect to any elementary or secondary school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible Department official determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part, at the earliest practicable time, and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan; in any case of continuing Federal financial assistance the responsible Department official may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may be specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purposes of the Act and the regulations in this part. In any case in which a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future modification of such order.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Illustrative application.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The following examples will illustrate the programs aided by Federal financial assistance of the Department. (In all cases the discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin prohibited by Title VI of the Act and this regulation, as a condition of the receipt of Federal financial assistance).</P>

            <P>(a) In federally assisted programs for the provision of health or welfare services, discrimination in the selection or eligibility of individuals to receive the services, and segregation or other discriminatory practices in the manner of providing them, are prohibited. This prohibition extends to all facilities and services provided by the grantee or, if the grantee is a State, by a political subdivision of the State. It extends also to services purchased or otherwise obtained by the grantee (or political subdivision) from hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and similar institutions for beneficiaries of the program, <PRTPAGE P="425"/>and to the facilities in which such services are provided, subject, however, to the provisions of § 80.3(e).</P>
            <P>(b) In federally-affected area assistance (Pub. L. 815 and Pub. L. 874) for construction aid and for general support of the operation of elementary or secondary schools, or in more limited support to such schools such as for the acquisition of equipment, the provision of vocational education, or the provision of guidance and counseling services, discrimination by the recipient school district in any of its elementary or secondary schools in the admission of students, or in the treatment of its students in any aspect of the educational process, is prohibited. In this and the following illustrations the prohibition of discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of the grantee or other recipient.</P>
            <P>(c) In a research, training, demonstration, or other grant to a university for activities to be conducted in a graduate school, discrimination in the admission and treatment of students in the graduate school is prohibited, and the prohibition extends to the entire university.</P>
            <P>(d) In a training grant to a hospital or other nonacademic institution, discrimination is prohibited in the selection of individuals to be trained and in their treatment by the grantee during their training. In a research or demonstration grant to such an institution discrimination is prohibited with respect to any educational activity and any provision of medical or other services and any financial aid to individuals incident to the program.</P>
            <P>(e) In grants to assist in the construction of facilities for the provision of health, educational or welfare services, assurances will be required that services will be provided without discrimination, to the same extent that discrimination would be prohibited as a condition of Federal operating grants for the support of such services. Thus, as a condition of grants for the construction of academic, research, or other facilities at institutions of higher education, assurances will be required that there will be no discrimination in the admission or treatment of students. In case of hospital construction grants the assurance will apply to patients, to interns, residents, student nurses, and other trainees, and to the privilege of physicians, dentists, and other professionally qualified persons to practice in the hospital, and will apply to the entire facility for which, or for a part of which, the grant is made, and to facilities operated in connection therewith.</P>
            <P>(f) Upon transfers of real or personal surplus property for health or educational uses, discrimination is prohibited to the same extent as in the case of grants for the construction of facilities or the provision of equipment for like purposes.</P>
            <P>(g) Each applicant for a grant for the construction of educational television facilities is required to provide an assurance that it will, in its broadcast services, give due consideration to the interests of all significant racial or ethnic groups within the population to be served by the applicant.</P>
            <P>(h) A recipient may not take action that is calculated to bring about indirectly what this regulation forbids it to accomplish directly. Thus, a State, in selecting or approving projects or sites for the construction of public libraries which will receive Federal financial assistance, may not base its selections or approvals on criteria which have the effect of defeating or of substantially impairing accomplishments of the objectives of the Federal assistance as respects individuals of a particular race, color or national origin.</P>

            <P>(i) In some situations, even though past discriminatory practices attributable to a recipient or applicant have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 80.6(d), to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity and the rights of beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary under the requirement stated in (i) of § 80.3(b) (6) for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make <PRTPAGE P="426"/>the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subject to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for obtaining referrals or making selections which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.</P>
            <P>(j) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances, an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.</P>

For example, recipients should have available for the Department racial and ethnic data showing the extent to which members of minority groups are beneficiaries of and participants in federally-assisted programs. In the case in which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.</P>

Such other means may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Noncompliance with § 80.4.</E> If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 80.4 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that the Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.</E> No order suspending, terminating or <PRTPAGE P="428"/>refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible Department official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3) the expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</P>

            <P>(3) If the responsible Department official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error.

The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">a. responsibilities of all state agency recipients</HD>
            <P>State agency recipients, in addition to complying with all other provisions of the Guidelines relevant to them, may not require, approve of, or engage in any discrimination or denial of services on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap in performing any of the following activities:</P>
            <P>1. Establishment of criteria or formulas for distribution of Federal or State funds to vocational education programs in the State;</P>
            <P>2. Establishment of requirements for admission to or requirements for the administration of vocational education programs;</P>
            <P>3. Approval of action by local entities providing vocational education. (For example, a State agency must ensure compliance with section IV of these Guidelines if and when it reviews a vocational education agency decision to create or change a geographic service area.);</P>
            <P>4. Conducting its own programs. (For example, in employing its staff it may not discriminate on the basis of sex or handicap.)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">b. state agencies performing oversight responsibilities</HD>

            <P>The State agency responsible for the administration of vocational education programs must adopt a compliance program to prevent, identify and remedy discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex or handicap by its subrecipients. (A <E T="03">subrecipient,</E> in this context, is a local agency or vocational education center that receives financial assistance through a State agency.) This compliance program must include:</P>
            <P>1. Collecting and analyzing civil rights related data and information that subrecipients compile for their own purposes or that are submitted to State and Federal officials under existing authorities;</P>
            <P>2. Conducting periodic compliance reviews of selected subrecipients (i.e., an investigation of a subrecipient to determine whether it engages in unlawful discrimination in any aspect of its program); upon finding unlawful discrimination, notifying the subrecipient of steps it must take to attain compliance and attempting to obtain voluntary compliance;</P>
            <P>3. Providing technical assistance upon request to subrecipients. This will include assisting subrecipients identify unlawful discrimination and instructing them in remedies for and prevention of such discrimination;</P>
            <P>4. Periodically reporting its activities and findings under the foregoing paragraphs, including findings of unlawful discrimination under paragraph 2, immediately above, to the Office for Civil Rights.</P>
            <P>State agencies are not required to terminate or defer assistance to any subrecipient. Nor are they required to conduct hearings. The responsibilities of the Office for Civil Rights to collect and analyze data, to conduct compliance reviews, to investigate complaints and to provide technical assistance are not diminished or attenuated by the requirements of Section II of the Guidelines.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">c. statement of procedures and practices</HD>
            <P>Within one year from the publication of these Guidelines in final form, each State agency recipient performing oversight responsibilities must submit to the Office for Civil Rights the methods of administration and related procedures it will follow to comply with the requirements described in paragraphs A and B immediately above. The Department will review each submission and will promptly either approve it, or return it to State officials for revision.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Distribution of Federal Financial Assistance and Other Funds for Vocational Education</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">a. agency responsibilities</HD>
            <P>Recipients that administer grants for vocational education must distribute Federal, State, or local vocational education funds so that no student or group of students is unlawfully denied an equal opportunity to benefit from vocational education on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">b. distribution of funds</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not adopt a formula or other method for the allocation of Federal, State, or local vocational education funds that has the effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. However, a recipient may adopt a formula or other method of allocation that uses as a factor race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap [or an index or proxy for race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap e.g., number of persons receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children or with limited English speaking ability] if the factor is included to compensate for past discrimination or to comply with those provisions of the Vocational Education Amendments of 1976 designed to assist specified protected groups.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">c. example of a pattern suggesting unlawful discrimination</HD>

            <P>In each State it is likely that some local recipients will enroll greater proportions of minority students in vocational education than the State-wide proportion of minority students in vocational education. A funding formula or other method of allocation that results in such local recipients receiving per-<PRTPAGE P="440"/>pupil allocations of Federal or State vocational education funds lower than the State-wide average per-pupil allocation will be presumed unlawfully discriminatory.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">d. distribution through competitive grants or contracts</HD>
            <P>Each State agency that establishes criteria for awarding competitive vocational education grants or contracts must establish and apply the criteria without regard to the race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap of any or all of a recipient's students, except to compensate for past discrimination.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">e. application processes for competitive or discretionary grants</HD>
            <P>State agencies must disseminate information needed to satisfy the requirements of any application process for competitive or discretionary grants so that all recipients, including those having a high percentage of minority or handicapped students, are informed of and able to seek funds. State agencies that provide technical assistance for the completion of the application process must provide such assistance without discrimination against any one recipient or class of recipients.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">f. alteration of fund distribution to provide equal opportunity</HD>
            <P>If the Office for Civil Rights finds that a recipient's system for distributing vocational education funds unlawfully discriminates on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap, it will require the recipient to adopt an alternative nondiscriminatory method of distribution. The Office for Civil Rights may also require the recipient to compensate for the effects of its past unlawful discrimination in the distribution of funds.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Access and Admission of Students to Vocational Education Programs</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">a. recipient responsibilities</HD>
            <P>Criteria controlling student eligibility for admission to vocational education schools, facilities and programs may not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. A recipient may not develop, impose, maintain, approve, or implement such discriminatory admissions criteria.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">b. site selection for vocational schools</HD>
            <P>State and local recipients may not select or approve a site for a vocational education facility for the purpose or with the effect of excluding, segregating, or otherwise discriminating against students on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Recipients must locate vocational education facilities at sites that are readily accessible to both nonminority and minority communities, and that do not tend to identify the facility or program as intended for nonminority or minority students.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">c. eligibility for admission to vocational education centers based on residence</HD>

            <P>Recipients may not establish, approve or maintain geographic boundaries for a vocational education center service area or attendance zone, (hereinafter <E T="03">service area</E>), that unlawfully exclude students on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The Office for Civil Rights will presume, subject to rebuttal, that any one or combination of the following circumstances indicates that the boundaries of a given service area are unlawfully constituted:</P>
            <P>1. A school system or service area contiguous to the given service area, contains minority or nonminority students in substantially greater proportion than the given service area;</P>
            <P>2. A substantial number of minority students who reside outside the given vocational education center service area, and who are not eligible for the center reside, nonetheless, as close to the center as a substantial number of non-minority students who are eligible for the center;</P>
            <P>3. The over-all vocational education program of the given service area in comparison to the over-all vocational education program of a contiguous school system or service area enrolling a substantially greater proportion of minority students: (a) Provides its students with a broader range of curricular offerings, facilities and equipment; or (b) provides its graduates greater opportunity for employment in jobs: (i) For which there is a demonstrated need in the community or region; (ii) that pay higher entry level salaries or wages; or (iii) that are generally acknowledged to offer greater prestige or status.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">d. additions and renovations to existing vocational education facilities</HD>
            <P>A recipient may not add to, modify, or renovate the physical plant of a vocational education facility in a manner that creates, maintains, or increases student segregation on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">e. remedies for violations of site selection and geographic service area requirements</HD>

            <P>If the conditions specified in paragraphs IV, A, B, C, or D, immediately above, are found and not rebutted by proof of nondiscrimination, the Office for Civil rights will require the recipient(s) to submit a plan to remedy the discrimination. The following are examples of steps that may be included in the plan, where necessary to overcome the <PRTPAGE P="441"/>discrimination: (1) Redrawing of the boundaries of the vocational education center's service area to include areas unlawfully excluded and/or to exclude areas unlawfully included; (2) provision of transportation to students residing in areas unlawfully excluded; (3) provision of additional programs and services to students who would have been eligible for attendance at the vocational education center but for the discriminatory service area or site selection; (4) reassignment of students; and (5) construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">f. eligibility for admission to secondary vocational education centers based on numerical limits imposed on sending schools</HD>
            <P>A recipient may not adopt or maintain a system for admission to a secondary vocational education center or program that limits admission to a fixed number of students from each sending school included in the center's service area if such a system disproportionately excludes students from the center on the basis of race, sex, national origin or handicap. (Example: Assume 25 percent of a school district's high school students are black and that most of those black students are enrolled in one high school; the white students, 75 percent of the district's total enrollment, are generally enrolled in the five remaining high schools. This paragraph prohibits a system of admission to the secondary vocational education center that limits eligibility to a fixed and equal number of students from each of the district's six high schools.)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">g. remedies for violation of eligibility based on numerical limits requirements</HD>
            <P>If the Office for Civil Rights finds a violation of paragraph F, above, the recipient must implement an alternative system of admissions that does not disproportionately exclude students on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">h. eligibility for admission to vocational education centers, branches or annexes based upon student option</HD>
            <P>A vocational education center, branch or annex, open to all students in a service area and predominantly enrolling minority students or students of one race, national origin or sex, will be presumed unlawfully segregated if: (1) It was established by a recipient for members of one race, national origin or sex; or (2) it has since its construction been attended primarily by members of one race, national origin or sex; or (3) most of its program offerings have traditionally been selected predominantely by members of one race, national origin or sex.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">i. remedies for facility segregation under student option plans</HD>
            <P>If the conditions specified in paragraph IV-H are found and not rebutted by proof of nondiscrimination, the Office for Civil Rights will require the recipient(s) to submit a plan to remedy the segregation. The following are examples of steps that may be included in the plan, where necessary to overcome the discrimination:</P>
            <P>(1) elimination of program duplication in the segregated facility and other proximate vocational facilities; (2) relocation or “clustering” of programs or courses; (3) adding programs and courses that traditionally have been identified as intended for members of a particular race, national origin or sex to schools that have traditionally served members of the other sex or traditionally served persons of a different race or national origin; (4) merger of programs into one facility through school closings or new construction; (5) intensive outreach recruitment and counseling; (6) providing free transportation to students whose enrollment would promote desegregation.</P>
            <P>[Paragraph J omitted]</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">k. eligibility based on evaluation of each applicant under admissions criteria</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not judge candidates for admission to vocational education programs on the basis of criteria that have the effect of disproportionately excluding persons of a particular race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. However, if a recipient can demonstrate that such criteria have been validated as essential to participation in a given program and that alternative equally valid criteria that do not have such a disproportionate adverse effect are unavailable, the criteria will be judged nondiscriminatory. Examples of admissions criteria that must meet this test are past academic performance, record of disciplinary infractions, counselors' approval, teachers' recommendations, interest inventories, high school diplomas and standardized tests, such as the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE).</P>

            <P>An introductory, preliminary, or exploratory course may not be established as a prerequisite for admission to a program unless the course has been and is available without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, and handicap. However, a course that was formerly only available on a discriminatory basis may be made a prerequisite for admission to a program if the recipient can demonstrate that: (a) the course is essential to participation in the program; <E T="03">and</E> (b) the course is presently available to those seeking enrollment for the first time and to those formerly excluded.<PRTPAGE P="442"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">l. eligibility of national origin minority persons with limited english language skills</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not restrict an applicant's admission to vocational education programs because the applicant, as a member of a national origin minority with limited English language skills, cannot participate in and benefit from vocational instruction to the same extent as a student whose primary language is English. It is the responsibility of the recipient to identify such applicants and assess their ability to participate in vocational instruction.</P>
            <P>Acceptable methods of identification include: (1) Identification by administrative staff, teachers, or parents of secondary level students; (2) identification by the student in postsecondary or adult programs; and (3) appropriate diagnostic procedures, if necessary.</P>
            <P>Recipients must take steps to open all vocational programs to these national origin minority students. A recipient must demonstrate that a concentration of students with limited English language skills in one or a few programs is not the result of discriminatory limitations upon the opportunities available to such students.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">m. remedial action in behalf of persons with limited english language skills</HD>
            <P>If the Office for Civil Rights finds that a recipient has denied national origin minority persons admission to a vocational school or program because of their limited English language skills or has assigned students to vocational programs solely on the basis of their limited English language skills, the recipient will be required to submit a remedial plan that insures national origin minority students equal access to vocational education programs.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">n. equal access for handicapped students</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not deny handicapped students access to vocational education programs or courses because of architectural or equipment barriers, or because of the need for related aids and services or auxiliary aids. If necessary, recipients must: (1) Modify instructional equipment; (2) modify or adapt the manner in which the courses are offered; (3) house the program in facilities that are readily accessible to mobility impaired students or alter facilities to make them readily accessible to mobility impaired students; and (4) provide auxiliary aids that effectively make lectures and necessary materials available to postsecondary handicapped students; (5) provide related aids or services that assure secondary students an appropriate education.</P>
            <P>Academic requirements that the recipient can demonstrate are essential to a program of instruction or to any directly related licensing requirement will not be regarded as discriminatory. However, where possible, a recipient must adjust those requirements to the needs of individual handicapped students.</P>
            <P>Access to vocational programs or courses may not be denied handicapped students on the ground that employment opportunities in any occupation or profession may be more limited for handicapped persons than for non-handicapped persons.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">o. public notification</HD>
            <P>Prior to the beginning of each school year, recipients must advise students, parents, employees and the general public that all vocational opportunities will be offered without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. Announcement of this policy of non-discrimination may be made, for example, in local newspapers, recipient publications and/or other media that reach the general public, program beneficiaries, minorities (including national origin minorities with limited English language skills), women, and handicapped persons. A brief summary of program offerings and admission criteria should be included in the announcement; also the name, address and telephone number of the person designated to coordinate Title IX and Section 504 compliance activity.</P>
            <P>If a recipient's service area contains a community of national origin minority persons with limited English language skills, public notification materials must be disseminated to that community in its language and must state that recipients will take steps to assure that the lack of English language skills will not be a barrier to admission and participation in vocational education programs.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Counseling and Prevocational Programs</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">a. recipient responsibilities</HD>
            <P>Recipients must insure that their counseling materials and activities (including student program selection and career/employment selection), promotional, and recruitment efforts do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">b. counseling and prospects for success</HD>

            <P>Recipients that operate vocational education programs must insure that counselors do not direct or urge any student to enroll in a particular career or program, or measure or predict a student's prospects for success in any career or program based upon the student's race, color, national origin, sex, or <PRTPAGE P="443"/>handicap. Recipients may not counsel handicapped students toward more restrictive career objectives than nonhandicapped students with similar abilities and interests. If a vocational program disproportionately enrolls male or female students, minority or nonminority students, or handicapped students, recipients must take steps to insure that the disproportion does not result from unlawful discrimination in counseling activities.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">c. student recruitment activities</HD>
            <P>Recipients must conduct their student recruitment activities so as not to exclude or limit opportunities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. Where recruitment activities involve the presentation or portrayal of vocational and career opportunities, the curricula and programs described should cover a broad range of occupational opportunities and not be limited on the basis of the race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap of the students or potential students to whom the presentation is made. Also, to the extent possible, recruiting teams should include persons of different races, national origins, sexes, and handicaps.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">d. counseling of students with limited english-speaking ability or hearing impairments</HD>
            <P>Recipients must insure that counselors can effectively communicate with national origin minority students with limited English language skills and with students who have hearing impairments. This requirement may be satisfied by having interpreters available.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">e. promotional activities</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not undertake promotional efforts (including activities of school officials, counselors, and vocational staff) in a manner that creates or perpetuates stereotypes or limitations based on race, color, national origin, sex or handicap. Examples of promotional efforts are career days, parents' night, shop demonstrations, visitations by groups of prospective students and by representatives from business and industry. Materials that are part of promotional efforts may not create or perpetuate stereotypes through text or illustration. To the extent possible they should portray males or females, minorities or handicapped persons in programs and occupations in which these groups traditionally have not been represented. If a recipient's service area contains a community of national origin minority persons with limited English language skills, promotional literature must be distributed to that community in its language.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">a. accommodations for handicapped students</HD>
            <P>Recipients must place secondary level handicapped students in the regular educational environment of any vocational education program to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the student unless it can be demonstrated that the education of the handicapped person in the regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily. Handicapped students may be placed in a program only after the recipient satisfies the provisions of the Department's Regulation, 45 CFR part 84, relating to evaluation, placement, and procedural safeguards. If a separate class or facility is identifiable as being for handicapped persons, the facility, the programs, and the services must be comparable to the facilities, programs, and services offered to nonhandicapped students.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">b. student financial assistance</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not award financial assistance in the form of loans, grants, scholarships, special funds, subsidies, compensation for work, or prizes to vocational education students on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap, except to overcome the effects of past discrimination. Recipients may administer sex restricted financial assistance where the assistance and restriction are established by will, trust, bequest, or any similar legal instrument, if the overall effect of all financial assistance awarded does not discriminate on the basis of sex. Materials and information used to notify students of opportunities for financial assistance may not contain language or examples that would lead applicants to believe the assistance is provided on a discriminatory basis. If a recipient's service area contains a community of national origin minority persons with limited English language skills, such information must be disseminated to that community in its language.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">c. housing in residential postsecondary vocational education centers</HD>

            <P>Recipients must extend housing opportunities without discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. This obligation extends to recipients that provide on-campus housing and/or that have agreements with providers of off-campus housing. In particular, a recipient postsecondary vocational education program that provides on-campus or off-campus housing to its nonhandicapped students must provide, at the same cost and under the same conditions, comparable convenient and accessible housing to handicapped students.<PRTPAGE P="444"/>

            <P>If a recipient enters into a written agreement for the referral or assignment of students to an employer, the agreement must contain an assurance from the employer that students will be accepted and assigned to jobs and otherwise treated without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.</P>
            <P>Recipients may not honor any employer's request for students who are free of handicaps or for students of a particular race, color, national origin, or sex. In the event an employer or prospective employer is or has been subject to court action involving discrimination in employment, school officials should rely on the court's findings if the decision resolves the issue of whether the employer has engaged in unlawful discrimination.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">b. apprentice training programs</HD>
            <P>A recipient may not enter into any agreement for the provision or support of apprentice training for students or union members with any labor union or other sponsor that discriminates against its members or applicants for membership on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. If a recipient enters into a written agreement with a labor union or other sponsor providing for apprentice training, the agreement must contain an assurance from the union or other sponsor: (1) That it does not engage in such discrimination against its membership or applicants for membership; and (2) that apprentice training will be offered and conducted for its membership free of such discrimination.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">b. recruitment</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not limit their recruitment for employees to schools, communities, or companies disproportionately composed of persons of a particular race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap except for the purpose of overcoming the effects of past discrimination. Every source of faculty must be notified that the recipient does not discriminate in employment on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">c. patterns of discrimination</HD>
            <P>Whenever the Office for Civil Rights finds that in light of the representation of protected groups in the relevant labor market there is a significant underrepresentation or overrepresentation of protected group persons on the staff of a vocational education school or program, it will presume that the disproportion results from unlawful discrimination. This presumption can be overcome by proof that qualified persons of the particular race, color, national origin, or sex, or that qualified handicapped persons are not in fact available in the relevant labor market.</P>

              <P>(b) An amicus curiae may submit a statement of position to the presiding officer prior to the beginning of a hearing, and shall serve a copy on each party.

His brief shall be filed and served on each party within the time limits applicable to the party whose position he deems himself to support; or if he does not deem himself to support the position of any party, within the longest time limit applicable to any party at that particular stage of the proceedings.</P>
              <P>(c) When all parties have completed their initial examination of a witness, any amicus curiae may request the presiding officer to propound specific questions to the witness. The presiding officer, in his discretion, may grant any such request if he believes the proposed additional testimony may assist materially in elucidating factual matters at issue between the parties and will not expand the issues.</P>

              <P>(a) The hearing is directed to receiving factual evidence and expert opinion testimony related to the issues in the proceeding.

In any case where it appears from the respondent's answer to the notice of hearing or opportunity for hearing, from his failure timely to answer, or from his admissions or stipulations in the record, that there are no matters of material fact in dispute, the reviewing authority or presiding officer may enter an order so finding, vacating the hearing date if one has been set, and fixing the time for filing briefs <PRTPAGE P="451"/>under § 81.101.

In such event the assertions objected to will not be received in evidence unless the affiant is made available for cross-examination, or the presiding officer determines that cross-examination is not necessary for the full and true disclosure of facts referred to in such assertions.

              <P>Within 20 days after the mailing of an initial or recommended decision, any party may file exceptions to the decision, stating reasons therefor, with the reviewing authority. Any other party may file a response thereto within 30 days after the mailing of the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions, the reviewing authority shall review the decision and issue its own decision thereon.</P>

              <P>(a) Where the hearing is conducted by a hearing examiner who makes an initial decision, if no exceptions thereto are filed within the 20-day period specified in § 81.103, such decision shall become the final decision of the Department, and shall constitute “final agency action” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704 (formerly section 10(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act), subject to the provisions of § 81.106.</P>
              <P>(b) Where the hearing is conducted by a hearing examiner who makes a recommended decision, or upon the filing of exceptions to a hearing examiner's initial decision, the reviewing authority shall review the recommended or initial decision and shall issue its own decision thereon, which shall become the final decision of the Department, and shall constitute “final agency action” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704 (formerly section 10(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act), subject to the provisions of § 81.106.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Oral argument to the reviewing authority.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If any party desires to argue a case orally on exceptions or replies to exceptions to an initial or recommended decision, he shall make such request in writing. The reviewing authority may grant or deny such requests in its discretion. If granted, it will serve notice of oral argument on all parties. The notice will set forth the order of presentation, the amount of time allotted, and the time and place for argument. The names of persons who will argue should be filed with the Department hearing clerk not later than 7 days before the date set for oral argument.</P>

              <P>(b) The purpose of oral argument is to emphasize and clarify the written argument in the briefs. Reading at length from the brief or other texts is not favored. Participants should confine their arguments to points of controlling importance and to points upon which exceptions have been filed. Consolidations of appearances at oral argument by parties taking the same side will permit the parties' interests to be <PRTPAGE P="454"/>presented more effectively in the time allotted.</P>
              <P>(c) Pamphlets, charts, and other written material may be presented at oral argument only if such material is limited to facts already in the record and is served on all parties and filed with the Department hearing clerk at least 7 days before the argument.</P>

The Secretary may grant or deny such request, in whole or in part, or serve notice of his intent to review the decision in whole or in part upon his own motion. If the Secretary grants the requested review, or if he serves notice of intent to review upon his own motion, each party to the decision shall have 20 days following notice of the Secretary's proposed action within which to file exceptions to the decision and supporting briefs and memoranda, or briefs and memoranda in support of the decision. Failure of a party to request review under this paragraph shall not be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose of obtaining judicial review.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Discriminatory acts prohibited.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any academic, extracurricular, research, occupational training, or other training program or activity operated by an entity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Discrimination in selection.</E> In determining whether an individual satisfies any enrollment, eligibility, or other condition for selection for a training program, a federally supported entity shall not:</P>
              <P>(1) On the basis of sex, given preference to one individual over another by ranking applicants on such basis, or otherwise give such preference; or</P>
              <P>(2) Apply numerical limitations upon the number or proportion of persons of either sex who may be admitted; or</P>
              <P>(3) Otherwise treat one individual differently from another on the basis of sex.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Testing.</E> A federally supported entity shall not administer or operate any test or use any criterion for admission which has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless the use of such test or criterion is shown validly to predict success in the training program or activity in question and alternative tests or criteria which do not have such a disproportionately adverse effect are shown to be unavailable.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Prohibitions relating to marital or parental status.</E> In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, in providing financial aid or any other benefit, an entity to which this subpart applies:</P>
              <P>(1) Shall not apply any rule concerning the actual or potential parental, family, or marital status of a student or applicant which treats persons differently on the basis of sex;</P>
              <P>(2) Shall not discriminate against or exclude any person on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy or recovery therefrom, or establish or follow any rule or practice which so discriminates or excludes;</P>

              <P>(3) Shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy and any temporary disabilities related to or resulting from pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy or recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability or physical condition; and<PRTPAGE P="459"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Shall not make pre-admission inquiry as to the marital status of an applicant for admission, including whether such applicant is “Miss,” or “Mrs.” A recipient may make pre-admission inquiry as to the sex of an applicant for admission, but only if such inquiry is made equally of such applicants of both sexes and if the results of such inquiry are not used in connection with discrimination prohibited by this part.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Preference to students from other institutions in admission.</E> An entity shall not give preference to applicants for admission, on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or other school or entity which admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preference has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of this part.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Discrimination in the provision of benefits and services</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this part in providing financial aid or any other benefit, or in providing any service, to an applicant for a training program or to a student enrolled in such program, no federally supported entity shall on the basis of sex:</P>

              <P>(ii) Provide a different benefit or service or provide a benefit or a service in a different manner;</P>
              <P>(iii) Deny an individual any such benefit or service;</P>

              <P>(v) Discriminate against any individual by assisting an agency, organization, or individual in providing, in a manner which discriminates on the basis of sex, a benefit or service to applicants for or students enrolled in a training program; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Otherwise limit any individual in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Financial aid established by certain legal instruments.</E> (i) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance established pursuant to domestic or foreign wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments or by acts of a foreign government which requires that awards be made to members of a particular sex specified therein: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the overall effect of the award of such sex-restricted scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial assistance does not discriminate on the basis of sex.</P>
              <P>(ii) To ensure nondiscriminatory awards of assistance as required in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, recipients shall develop and use procedures under which:</P>

              <P>(B) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) (A) of this section; and</P>

              <P>(g) <E T="03">Housing.</E> (1) An entity shall not, on the basis of sex, apply different rules or regulations, impose different fees or requirements, or offer different services or benefits related to housing, except as provided in this subsection (including housing provided only to married students).</P>
              <P>(2) An entity may provide separate housing on the basis of sex.</P>
              <P>(3) Housing provided by an entity to students of one sex, when compared to that provided to students of the other sex, shall be as a whole: (i) Proportionate in quantity to the number of students of that sex applying for such housing; and (ii) comparable in quality and cost to the student.</P>
              <P>(4) An entity shall not on the basis of sex, administer different policies or practices concerning occupancy by its students of housing other than that provided by such recipient.</P>

              <P>(5) An entity which, through solicitation, listing, approval of housing, or otherwise, assists any agency, organization, or person in making housing <PRTPAGE P="460"/>available to any of its students, shall take reasonable action to ensure that such housing is provided to students of one sex, when compared to that provided to students of the other sex, is as a whole: (i) Proportionate in quantity and (ii) comparable in quality and cost to the student. An entity may render such assistance to any agency, organization, or person which provides all or part of such housing to students only of one sex.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Inter-institutional programs.</E> If a federally supported entity aids participation, by any applicant for or student enrolled in any of its training programs, in any program or activity of another organization or agency, such entity shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Develop and implement a procedure to assure itself that such organization or agency takes no action with respect to such applicants or students which this part would prohibit such entity from taking; and</P>
              <P>(2) Not aid such participation if such organization or agency takes such action.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Discrimination in employment prohibited.</E> A federally supported entity shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in employment practices relating to its professional and other staff who work directly with applicants for or students enrolled in any of its training programs.

A federally supported entity shall not recruit for any of its training programs exclusively or primarily at organizations or agencies which admit as members or students, or which provide a service for, only members of one sex unless such entity can demonstrate that such action is part of a recruitment program which does not have the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in selection for a training program.</P>

              <P>(1) Prominently include a statement of its policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in each announcement, bulletin, catalogue, or application form which describes the training program of such entity or is used in connection with the recruitment of employees who will work directly with applicants for or students enrolled in a training program;</P>

              <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, <E T="03">Provided,</E> That: (1) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of handicap, and (2) the results of such an examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Accessibility.</E> A recipient shall operate its program or activity so that when each part is viewed in its entirety, it is readily accessible to handicapped persons. This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> A recipient may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of health, welfare, or other social services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the requirements of § 84.23, or any other methods that result in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in <PRTPAGE P="470"/>existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Small health, welfare, or other social service providers.</E> If a recipient with fewer than fifteen employees that provides health, welfare, or other social services finds, after consultation with a handicapped person seeking its services, that there is no method of complying with paragraph (a) of this section other than making a significant alteration in its existing facilities, the recipient may, as an alternative, refer the handicapped person to other providers of those services that are accessible.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time period.</E> A recipient shall comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are necessary, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped persons;</P>
              <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
              <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve full accessibility under paragraph (a) and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify the steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
              <P>(4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice.</E> The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Free appropriate public education.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education program or activity shall provide a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's jurisdiction, regardless of the nature or severity of the person's handicap.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Appropriate education.</E> (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the provision of an appropriate education is the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii) are based upon adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of §§ 84.34, 84.35, and 84.36.</P>
              <P>(2) Implementation of an Individualized Education Program developed in accordance with the Education of the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting the standard established in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) A recipient may place a handicapped person or refer such a person for aids, benefits, or services other than those that it operates or provides as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart. If so, the recipient remains responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this subpart are met with respect to any handicapped person so placed or referred.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Free education</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> For the purpose of this section, the provision of a free education is the provision of educational and related services without cost to the handicapped person or to his or her parents or guardian, except for those fees that are imposed on non-handicapped persons or their parents or guardian. It may consist either of the provision of free services or, if a recipient places a handicapped person or refers such person for aids, benefits, or services not operated or provided by the recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, of payment for the costs of the aids, benefits, or services. Funds available from any public or private agency may be used to meet the requirements of this subpart. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve an insurer or similar third party from an otherwise valid obligation to provide or pay for services provided to a handicapped person.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Transportation.</E> If a recipient places a handicapped person or refers such person for aids, benefits, or services not operated or provided by the recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, the recipient shall ensure that adequate transportation to and from the aids, <PRTPAGE P="472"/>benefits, or services is provided at no greater cost than would be incurred by the person or his or her parents or guardian if the person were placed in the aids, benefits, or services operated by the recipient.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Residential placement.</E> If a public or private residential placement is necessary to provide a free appropriate public education to a handicapped person because of his or her handicap, the placement, including non-medical care and room and board, shall be provided at no cost to the person or his or her parents or guardian.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Placement of handicapped persons by parents.</E> If a recipient has made available, in conformance with the requirements of this section and § 84.34, a free appropriate public education to a handicapped person and the person's parents or guardian choose to place the person in a private school, the recipient is not required to pay for the person's education in the private school. Disagreements between a parent or guardian and a recipient regarding whether the recipient has made a free appropriate public education available or otherwise regarding the question of financial responsibility are subject to the due process procedures of § 84.36.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Compliance.</E> A recipient may not exclude any qualified handicapped person from a public elementary or secondary education after the effective date of this part. A recipient that is not, on the effective date of this regulation, in full compliance with the other requirements of the preceding paragraphs of this section shall meet such requirements at the earliest practicable time and in no event later than September 1, 1978.</P>

A recipient shall place a handicapped person in the regular educational environment operated by the recipient unless it is demonstrated by the recipient that the education of the person in the regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Comparable facilities.</E> If a recipient, in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, operates a facility that is identifiable as being for handicapped persons, the recipient shall ensure that the facility and the services and activities provided therein are comparable to the other facilities, services, and activities of the recipient.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Evaluation procedures.</E> A recipient to which this subpart applies shall establish standards and procedures for the evaluation and placement of persons who, because of handicap, need or are believed to need special education or related services which ensure that:</P>

              <P>(1) Tests and other evaluation materials have been validated for the specific purpose for which they are used <PRTPAGE P="473"/>and are administered by trained personnel in conformance with the instructions provided by their producer;</P>
              <P>(2) Tests and other evaluation materials include those tailored to assess specific areas of educational need and not merely those which are designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient; and</P>
              <P>(3) Tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to a student with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the student's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Placement procedures.</E> In interpreting evaluation data and in making placement decisions, a recipient shall (1) draw upon information from a variety of sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, teacher recommendations, physical condition, social or cultural background, and adaptive behavior, (2) establish procedures to ensure that information obtained from all such sources is documented and carefully considered, (3) ensure that the placement decision is made by a group of persons, including persons knowledgeable about the child, the meaning of the evaluation data, and the placement options, and (4) ensure that the placement decision is made in conformity with § 84.34.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reevaluation.</E> A recipient to which this section applies shall establish procedures, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, for periodic reevaluation of students who have been provided special education and related services. A reevaluation procedure consistent with the Education for the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting this requirement.</P>

              <P>(1) May not apply limitations upon the number or proportion of handicapped persons who may be admitted;</P>
              <P>(2) May not make use of any test or criterion for admission that has a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons or any class of handicapped persons unless (i) the test or criterion, as used by the recipient, has been validated as a predictor of success in the education program or activity in question and (ii) alternate tests or criteria that have a less disproportionate, adverse effect are not shown by the Director to be available.</P>

              <P>(3) Shall assure itself that (i) admissions tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to an applicant who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure); (ii) admissions tests that are designed for <PRTPAGE P="475"/>persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills are offered as often and in as timely a manner as are other admissions tests; and (iii) admissions tests are administered in facilities that, on the whole, are accessible to handicapped persons; and</P>

              <P>(2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Validity studies.</E> For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a recipient may base prediction equations on first year grades, but shall conduct periodic validity studies against the criterion of overall success in the education program or activity in question in order to monitor the general validity of the test scores.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Model Infant Care Review Committee.</E> Recipient health care providers wishing to establish Infant Care Review Committees should consider adoption of the following model. This model is advisory. Recipient health care providers are not required to establish a review committee or, if one is established, to adhere to this model. In seeking to determine compliance with this part, as it relates to health care for handicapped infants, by health care providers that have an ICRC established and operated substantially in accordance with this model, the Department will, to the extent possible, consult with the ICRC.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Establishment and purpose.</E> (i) The hospital establishes an Infant Care Review Committee (ICRC) or joins with one or more other hospitals to create a joint ICRC. The establishing document will state that the ICRC is for the purpose of facilitating the development and implementation of standards, policies and procedures designed to assure that, while respecting reasonable medical judgments, treatment and nourishment not be withheld, solely on the basis of present or anticipated physical or mental impairments, from handicapped infants who, in spite of such impairments, will benefit medically from the treatment or nourishment.</P>
              <P>(ii) The activities of the ICRC will be guided by the following principles:</P>
              <P>(A) The interpretative guidelines of the Department relating to the applicability of this part to health care for handicapped infants.</P>

              <P>(B) As stated in the “Principles of Treatment of Disabled Infants” of the coalition of major medical and disability organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, Association for Retarded Citizens, Down's Syndrome Congress, Spina Bifida Association, and others:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>When medical care is clearly beneficial, it should always be provided. When appropriate medical care is not available, arrangements should be made to transfer the infant to an appropriate medical facility. Consideration such as anticipated or actual limited potential of an individual and present or future lack of available community resources are irrelevant and must not determine the decisions concerning medical care. The individual's medical condition should be the sole focus of the decision. These are very strict standards.</P>
                <P>It is ethically and legally justified to withhold medical or surgical procedures which are clearly futile and will only prolong the act of dying. However, supportive care should be provided, including sustenance as medically indicated and relief of pain and suffering. The needs of the dying person should be respected. The family also should be supported in its grieving.</P>

                <P>In cases where it is uncertain whether medical treatment will be beneficial, a person's disability must not be the basis for a decision to withhold treatment. At all times during the process when decisions are being <PRTPAGE P="481"/>made about the benefit or futility of medical treatment, the person should be cared for in the medically most appropriate ways. When doubt exists at any time about whether to treat, a presumption always should be in favor of treatment.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              

              <P>(C) As stated by the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>This [standard for providing medically beneficial treatment] is a very strict standard in that it excludes consideration of the negative effects of an impaired child's life on other persons, including parents, siblings, and society. Although abiding by this standard may be difficult in specific cases, it is all too easy to undervalue the lives of handicapped infants; the Commission finds it imperative to counteract this by treating them no less vigorously than their healthy peers or than older children with similar handicaps would be treated.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(iii) The ICRC will carry out its purposes by:</P>
              <P>(A) Recommending institutional policies concerning the withholding or withdrawal of medical or surgical treatments to infants, including guidelines for ICRC action for specific categories of life-threatening conditions affecting infants;</P>
              <P>(B) Providing advice in specific cases when decisions are being considered to withhold or withdraw from infant life-sustaining medical or surgical treatment; and</P>
              <P>(C) Reviewing retrospectively on a regular basis infant medical records in situations in which life-sustaining medical or surgical treatment has been withheld or withdrawn.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Organization and staffing.</E> The ICRC will consist of at least 7 members and include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A practicing physician (e.g., a pediatrician, a neonatologist, or a pediatric surgeon),</P>
              <P>(ii) A practicing nurse,</P>
              <P>(iii) A hospital administrator,</P>
              <P>(iv) A representative of the legal profession,</P>
              <P>(v) A representative of a disability group, or a developmental disability expert,</P>
              <P>(vi) A lay community member, and</P>
              <P>(vii) A member of a facility's organized medical staff, who shall serve as chairperson.</P>
              <FP>In connection with review of specific cases, one member of the ICRC shall be designated to act as “special advocate” for the infant, as provided in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(E) of the section. The hospital will provide staff support for the ICRC, including legal counsel. The ICRC will meet on a regular basis, or as required below in connection with review of specific cases. It shall adopt or recommend to the appropriate hospital official or body such administrative policies as terms of office and quorum requirements. The ICRC will recommend procedures to ensure that both hospital personnel and patient families are fully informed of the existence and functions of the ICRC and its availability on a 24-hour basis.</FP>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Operation of ICRC</E>—(i) <E T="03">Prospective policy development.</E> (A) The ICRC will develop and recommend for adoption by the hospital institutional policies concerning the withholding or withdrawal of medical treatment for infants with life-threatening conditions. These will include guidelines for management of specific types of cases or diagnoses, for example, Down's syndrome and spina bifida, and procedures to be followed in such recurring circumstances as, for example, brain death and parental refusal to consent to life-saving treatment. The hospital, upon recommendation of the ICRC, may require attending physicians to notify the ICRC of the presence in the facility of an infant with a diagnosis specified by the ICRC, e.g., Down's syndrome and spina bifida.</P>
              <P>(B) In recommending these policies and guidelines, the ICRC will consult with medical and other authorities on issues involving disabled individuals, e.g., neonatologists, pediatric surgeons, county and city agencies which provide services for the disabled, and disability advocacy organizations. It will also consult with appropriate committees of the medical staff, to ensure that the ICRC policies and guidelines build on existing staff by-laws, rules and regulations concerning consultations and staff membership requirements. The ICRC will also inform and educate hospital staff on the policies and guidelines it develops.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Review of specific cases.</E> In addition to regularly scheduled meetings, <PRTPAGE P="482"/>interim ICRC meetings will take place under specified circumstances to permit review of individual cases. The hospital will, to the extent possible, require in each case that life-sustaining treatment be continued, until the ICRC can review the case and provide advice.</P>
              <P>(A) Interim ICRC meetings will be convened within 24 hours (or less if indicated) when there is disagreement between the family of an infant and the infant's physician as to the withholding or withdrawal of treatment, when a preliminary decision to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment has been made in certain categories of cases identified by the ICRC, when there is disagreement between members of the hospital's medical and/or nursing staffs, or when otherwise appropriate.</P>
              <P>(B) Such interim ICRC meetings will take place upon the request of any member of the ICRC or hospital staff or parent or guardian of the infant. The ICRC will have procedures to preserve the confidentiality of the identity of persons making such requests, and such persons shall be protected from reprisal. When appropriate, the ICRC or a designated member will inform the requesting individual of the ICRC's recommendation.</P>
              <P>(C) The ICRC may provide for telephone and other forms of review when the timing and nature of the case, as identified in policies developed by the ICRC, make the convening of an interim meeting impracticable.</P>
              <P>(D) Interim meetings will be open to the affected parties. The ICRC will ensure that the interests of the parents, the physician, and the child are fully considered; that family members have been fully informed of the patient's condition and prognosis; that they have been provided with a listing which describes the services furnished by parent support groups and public and private agencies in the geographic vicinity to infants with conditions such as that before the ICRC; and that the ICRC will facilitate their access to such services and groups.</P>
              <P>(E) To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of all options and factors pertinent to the committee's deliberations, the chairperson will designate one member of the ICRC to act, in connection with that specific case, as special advocate for the infant. The special advocate will seek to ensure that all considerations in favor of the provision of life-sustaining treatment are fully evaluated and considered by the ICRC.</P>
              <P>(F) In cases in which there is disagreement on treatment between a physician and an infant's family, and the family wishes to continue life-sustaining treatment, the family's wishes will be carried out, for as long as the family wishes, unless such treatment is medically contraindicated. When there is physician/family disagreement and the family refuses consent to life-sustaining treatment, and the ICRC, after due deliberation, agrees with the family, the ICRC will recommend that the treatment be withheld. When there is physician/family disagreement and the family refuses consent, but the ICRC disagrees with the family, the ICRC will recommend to the hospital board or appropriate official that the case be referred immediately to an appropriate court or child protective agency, and every effort shall be made to continue treatment, preserve the status quo, and prevent worsening of the infant's condition until such time as the court or agency renders a decision or takes other appropriate action. The ICRC will also follow this procedure in cases in which the family and physician agree that life-sustaining treatment should be withheld or withdrawn, but the ICRC disagrees.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Retrospective record review.</E> The ICRC, at its regularly-scheduled meeting, will review all records involving withholding or termination of medical or surgical treatment to infants consistent with hospital policies developed by the ICRC, unless the case was previously before the ICRC pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. If the ICRC finds that a deviation was made from the institutional policies in a given case, it shall conduct a review and report the findings to appropriate hospital personnel for appropriate action.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Records.</E> The ICRC will maintain records of all of its deliberations and summary descriptions of specific cases considered and the disposition of those cases. Such records will be kept in accordance with institutional policies on <PRTPAGE P="483"/>confidentiality of medical information. They will be made available to appropriate government agencies, or upon court order, or as otherwise required by law.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">subpart a—general provisions</HD>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Definitions</E>—1. <E T="03">“Recipient”.</E> Section 84.23 contains definitions used throughout the regulation. Most of the comments concerning § 84.3(f), which contains the definition of “recipient,” commended the inclusion of recipient whose sole source of Federal financial assistance is Medicaid. The Secretary believes that such Medicaid providers should be regarded as recipients under the statute and the regulation and should be held individually responsible for administering services in a nondiscriminatory fashion. Accordingly, § 84.3(f) has not been changed. Small Medicaid providers, however, are exempt from some of the regulation's administrative provisions (those that apply to recipients with fifteen or more employees). And such recipients will be permitted to refer patients to accessible facilities in certain limited circumstances under revised § 84.22(b). The Secretary recognizes the difficulties involved in Federal enforcement of this regulation with respect to thousands of individual Medicaid providers. As in the case of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Office for Civil Rights will concentrate its compliance efforts on the state Medicaid agencies and will look primarily to them to ensure compliance by individual providers.</P>
              <P>One other comment requested that the regulation specify that nonpublic elementary and secondary schools that are not otherwise recipients do not become recipients by virtue of the fact their students participate in certain federally funded programs. The Secretary believes it unnecessary to amend the regulation in this regard, because almost identical language in the Department's regulations implementing title VI and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 has consistently been interpreted so as not to render such schools recipients. These schools, however, are indirectly subject to the substantive requirements of this regulation through the application of § 84.4(b)(iv), which prohibits recipients from assisting agencies that discriminate on the basis of handicap in providing services to beneficiairies of the recipients' programs.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">“Federal financial assistance”.</E> In § 84.3(h), defining Federal financial assistance, a clarifying change has been made: procurement contracts are specifically excluded. They are covered, however, by the Department of Labor's regulation under section 503. The Department has never considered such contracts to be contracts of assistance; the explicit exemption has been added only to avoid possible confusion.</P>
              <P>The proposed regulation's exemption of contracts of insurance or guaranty has been retained. A number of comments argued for its deletion on the ground that section 504, unlike title VI and title IX, contains no statutory exemption for such contracts. There is no indication, however, in the legislative history of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or of the amendments to that Act in 1974, that Congress intended section 504 to have a broader application, in terms of Federal financial assistance, than other civil rights statutes. Indeed, Congress directed that section 504 be implemented in the same manner as titles VI and IX. In view of the long established exemption of contracts of insurance or guaranty under title VI, we think it unlikely that Congress intended section 504 to apply to such contracts.</P>

              <P>In its May 1976 Notice of Intent, the Department suggested that the arrangement under which individual practitioners, hospitals, and other facilities receive reimbursement for providing services to beneficiaries under Part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare) constitutes a contract <PRTPAGE P="484"/>of insurance or guaranty and thus falls within the exemption from the regulation. This explanation oversimplified the Department's view of whether Medicare Part B constitutes Federal financial assistance. The Department's position has consistently been that, whether or not Medicare Part B arrangements involve a contract of insurance or guaranty, no Federal financial assistance flows from the Department to the doctor or other practitioner under the program, since Medicare Part B—like other social security programs—is basically a program of payments to direct beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">“Handicapped person”.</E> Section 84.3(j), which defines the class of persons protected under the regulation, has not been substantially changed. The definition of handicapped person in paragraph (j)(1) conforms to the statutory definition of handicapped person that is applicable to section 504, as set forth in section 111(a) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93-516.</P>
              <P>The first of the three parts of the statutory and regulatory definition includes any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Paragraph (j)(2)(i) further defines physical or mental impairments. The definition does not set forth a list of specific diseases and conditions that constitute physical or mental impairments because of the difficulty of ensuring the comprehensiveness of any such list. The term includes, however, such diseases and conditions as orthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, and, as discussed below, drug addiction and alcoholism.</P>
              <P>It should be emphasized that a physical or mental impairment does not constitute a handicap for purposes of section 504 unless its severity is such that it results in a substantial limitation of one or more major life activities. Several comments observed the lack of any definition in the proposed regulation of the phrase “substantially limits.” The Department does not believe that a definition of this term is possible at this time.</P>
              <P>A related issue raised by several comments is whether the definition of handicapped person is unreasonably broad. Comments suggested narrowing the definition in various ways. the most common recommendation was that only “traditional” handicaps be covered. The Department continues to believe, however, that it has no flexibility within the statutory definition to limit the term to persons who have those severe, permanent, or progressive conditions that are most commonly regarded as handicaps. The Department intends, however, to give particular attention in its enforcement of section 504 to eliminating discrimination against persons with the severe handicaps that were the focus of concern in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</P>
              <P>The definition of handicapped person also includes specific limitations on what persons are classified as handicapped under the regulation. The first of the three parts of the definition specifies that only physical and mental handicaps are included. Thus, environmental, cultural, and economic disadvantage are not in themselves covered; nor are prison records, age, or homosexuality. Of course, if a person who has any of these characteristics also has a physical or mental handicap, the person is included within the definition of handicapped person.</P>
              <P>In paragraph (j)(2)(i), physical or mental impairment is defined to include, among other impairments, specific learning disabilities. The Department will interpret the term as it is used in section 602 of the Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended. Paragraph (15) of section 602 uses the term “specific learning disabilities” to describe such conditions as perceptual handicaps, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (j)(2)(i) has been shortened, but not substantively changed, by the deletion of clause (C), which made explicit the inclusion of any condition which is mental or physical but whose precise nature is not at present known. Clauses (A) and (B) clearly comprehend such conditions.</P>
              <P>The second part of the statutory and regulatory definition of handicapped person includes any person who has a record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Under the definition of “record” in paragraph (j)(2)(iii), persons who have a history of a handicapping condition but no longer have the condition, as well as persons who have been incorrectly classified as having such a condition, are protected from discrimination under section 504. Frequently occurring examples of the first group are persons with histories of mental or emotional illness, heart disease, or cancer; of the second group, persons who have been misclassified as mentally retarded.</P>

              <P>The third part of the statutory and regulatory definition of handicapped person includes any person who is regarded as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. It includes many persons who are ordinarily considered to be handicapped but who do not technically fall within the first two parts of the statutory definition, such as persons with a limp. This part of the definition also includes some persons who might not ordinarily be considered handicapped, such as persons with disfiguring scars, as well as persons who have no physical or mental impairment but are treated by a recipient as if they were handicapped.<PRTPAGE P="485"/>
              </P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Drug addicts and alcoholics.</E> As was the case during the first comment period, the issue of whether to include drug addicts and alcoholics within the definition of handicapped person was of major concern to many commenters. The arguments presented on each side of the issue were similar during the two comment periods, as was the preference of commenters for exclusion of this group of persons. While some comments reflected misconceptions about the implications of including alcoholics and drug addicts within the scope of the regulation, the Secretary understands the concerns that underlie the comments on this question and recognizes that application of section 504 to active alcoholics and drug addicts presents sensitive and difficult questions that must be taken into account in interpretation and enforcement.</P>
              <P>The Secretary has carefully examined the issue and has obtained a legal opinion from the Attorney General. That opinion concludes that drug addiction and alcoholism are “physical or mental impairments” within the meaning of section 7(6) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and that drug addicts and alcoholics are therefore handicapped for purposes of section 504 if their impairment substantially limits one of their major life activities. The Secretary therefore believes that he is without authority to exclude these conditions from the definition. There is a medical and legal consensus that alcoholism and drug addiction are diseases, although there is disagreement as to whether they are primarily mental or physical. In addition, while Congress did not focus specifically on the problems of drug addiction and alcoholism in enacting section 504, the committees that considered the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 were made aware of the Department's long-standing practice of treating addicts and alcoholics as handicapped individuals eligible for rehabilitation services under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act.</P>
              <P>The Secretary wishes to reassure recipients that inclusion of addicts and alcoholics within the scope of the regulation will not lead to the consequences feared by many commenters. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the statute and the regulation apply only to discrimination against qualified handicapped persons solely by reason of their handicap. The fact that drug addiction and alcoholism may be handicaps does not mean that these conditions must be ignored in determining whether an individual is qualified for services or employment opportunities. On the contrary, a recipient may hold a drug addict or alcoholic to the same standard of performance and behavior to which it holds others, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the person's drug addiction or alcoholism. In other words, while an alcoholic or drug addict may not be denied services or disqualified from employment solely because of his or her condition, the behavioral manifestations of the condition may be taken into account in determining whether he or she is qualified.</P>
              <P>With respect to the employment of a drug addict or alcoholic, if it can be shown that the addiction or alcoholism prevents successful performance of the job, the person need not be provided the employment opportunity in question. For example, in making employment decisions, a recipient may judge addicts and alcoholics on the same basis it judges all other applicants and employees. Thus, a recipient may consider—for all applicants including drug addicts and alcoholics—past personnel records, absenteeism, disruptive, abusive, or dangerous behavior, violations of rules and unsatisfactory work performance. Moreover, employers may enforce rules prohibiting the possession or use of alcohol or drugs in the work-place, provided that such rules are enforced against all employees.</P>
              <P>With respect to services, there is evidence that drug addicts and alcoholics are often denied treatment at hospitals for conditions unrelated to their addiction or alcoholism. In addition, some addicts and alcoholics have been denied emergency treatment. These practices have been specifically prohibited by section 407 of the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972 (21 U.S.C. 1174) and section 321 of the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4581), as amended. These statutory provisions are also administered by the Department's Office for Civil Rights and are implemented in § 84.53 of this regulation.</P>
              <P>With respect to other services, the implications of coverage, of alcoholics and drug addicts are two-fold: first, no person may be excluded from services solely by reason of the presence or history of these conditions; second, to the extent that the manifestations of the condition prevent the person from meeting the basic eligibility requirements of the program or cause substantial interference with the operation of the program, the condition may be taken into consideration. Thus, a college may not exclude an addict or alcoholic as a student, on the basis of addiction or alcoholism, if the person can successfully participate in the education program and complies with the rules of the college and if his or her behavior does not impede the performance of other students.</P>

              <P>Of great concern to many commenters was the question of what effect the inclusion of drug addicts and alcoholics as handicapped persons would have on school disciplinary rules prohibiting the use or possession of drugs or alcohol by students. Neither such rules nor their application to drug addicts or alcoholics is prohibited by this regulation, <PRTPAGE P="486"/>provided that the rules are enforced evenly with respect to all students.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">“Qualified handicapped person.”</E> Paragraph (k) of § 84.3 defines the term “qualified handicapped person.” Throughout the regulation, this term is used instead of the statutory term “otherwise qualified handicapped person.” The Department believes that the omission of the word “otherwise” is necessary in order to comport with the intent of the statute because, read literally, “otherwise” qualified handicapped persons include persons who are qualified except for their handicap, rather than in spite of their handicap. Under such a literal reading, a blind person possessing all the qualifications for driving a bus except sight could be said to be “otherwise qualified” for the job of driving. Clearly, such a result was not intended by Congress. In all other respects, the terms “qualified” and “otherwise qualified” are intended to be interchangeable.</P>
              <P>Section 84.3(k)(1) defines a qualified handicapped person with respect to employment as a handicapped person who can, with reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of the job in question. The term “essential functions” does not appear in the corresponding provision of the Department of Labor's section 503 regulation, and a few commenters objected to its inclusion on the ground that a handicapped person should be able to perform all job tasks. However, the Department believes that inclusion of the phrase is useful in emphasizing that handicapped persons should not be disqualified simply because they may have difficulty in performing tasks that bear only a marginal relationship to a particular job. Further, we are convinced that inclusion of the phrase is not inconsistent with the Department of Labor's application of its definition.</P>
              <P>Certain commenters urged that the definition of qualified handicapped person be amended so as explicitly to place upon the employer the burden of showing that a particular mental or physical characteristic is essential. Because the same result is achieved by the requirement contained in paragraph (a) of § 84.13, which requires an employer to establish that any selection criterion that tends to screen out handicapped persons is job-related, that recommendation has not been followed.</P>
              <P>Section 84.3(k)(2) (formerly § 84.3(k)(3)) defines qualified handicapped person, with respect to preschool, elementary, and secondary programs, in terms of age. Several commenters recommended that eligibility for the services be based upon the standard of substantial benefit, rather than age, because of the need of many handicapped children for early or extended services if they are to have an equal opportunity to benefit from education programs. No change has been made in this provision, again because of the extreme difficulties in administration that would result from the choice of the former standard. Under the remedial action provisions of § 84.6(a)(3), however, persons beyond the age limits prescribed in § 84.3(k)(2) may in appropriate cases be required to be provided services that they were formerly denied because of a recipient's violation of section 504.</P>
              <P>Section 84.3(k)(2) states that a handicapped person is qualified for preschool, elementary, or secondary services if the person is of an age at which nonhandicapped persons are eligible for such services or at which state law mandates the provision of educational services to handicapped persons. In addition, the extended age ranges for which recipients must provide full educational opportunity to all handicapped persons in order to be eligible for assistance under the Education of the Handicapped Act—generally, 3-18 as of September 1978, and 3-21 as of September 1980 are incorporated by reference in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>Section 84.3(k)(3) formerly § 84.3(k)(2)) defines qualified handicapped person with respect to postsecondary educational programs. As revised, the paragraph means that both academic and technical standards must be met by applicants to these programs. The term “technical standards” refers to all nonacademic admissions criteria that are essential to participation in the program in question.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">General prohibitions against discrimination.</E> Section 84.4 contains general prohibitions against discrimination applicable to all recipients of assistance from this Department.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b)(1(i) prohibits the exclusion of qualified handicapped persons from aids, benefits, or services, and paragraph (ii) requires that equal opportunity to participate or benefit be provided. Paragraph (iii) requires that services provided to handicapped persons be as effective as those provided to the nonhandicapped. In paragraph (iv), different or separate services are prohibited except when necessary to provide equally effective benefits.</P>

              <P>In this context, the term “equally effective,” defined in paragraph (b)(2), is intended to encompass the concept of equivalent, as opposed to identical, services and to acknowledge the fact that in order to meet the individual needs of handicapped persons to the same extent that the corresponding needs of nonhandicapped persons are met, adjustments to regular programs or the provision of different programs may sometimes be necessary. For example, a welfare office that uses the telephone for communicating with its clients must provide alternative modes of communicating with its deaf clients. This standard parallels the one established under title VI of Civil Rights Act of 1964 with respect to the provision of educational services to students whose primary language is not English. See <E T="03">Lau</E> v. <E T="03">Nichols,</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="487"/>414 U.S. 563 (1974). To be equally effective, however, an aid, benefit, or service need not produce equal results; it merely must afford an equal opportunity to achieve equal results.</P>
              <P>It must be emphasized that, although separate services must be required in some instances, the provision of unnecessarily separate or different services is discriminatory. The addition to paragraph (b)(2) of the phrase “in the most integrated setting appropriated to the person's needs” is intended to reinforce this general concept. A new paragraph (b)(3) has also been added to § 84.4, requiring recipients to give qualified handicapped persons the option of participating in regular programs despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs. The requirement has been reiterated in §§ 84.38 and 84.47 in connection with physical education and athletics programs.</P>
              <P>Section 84.4(b)(1)(v) prohibits a recipient from supporting another entity or person that subjects participants or employees in the recipient's program to discrimination on the basis of handicap. This section would, for example, prohibit financial support by a recipient to a community recreational group or to a professional or social organization that discriminates against handicapped persons. Among the criteria to be considered in each case are the substantiality of the relationship between the recipient and the other entity, including financial support by the recipient, and whether the other entity's activities relate so closely to the recipient's program or activity that they fairly should be considered activities of the recipient itself. Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) was added in response to comment in order to make explicit the prohibition against denying qualified handicapped persons the opportunity to serve on planning and advisory boards responsible for guiding federally assisted programs or activities.</P>
              <P>Several comments appeared to interpret § 84.4(b)(5), which proscribes discriminatory site selection, to prohibit a recipient that is located on hilly terrain from erecting any new buildings at its present site. That, of course, is not the case. This paragraph is not intended to apply to construction of additional buildings at an existing site. Of course, any such facilities must be made accessible in accordance with the requirements of § 84.23.</P>
              <P>7. <E T="03">Assurances of compliance.</E> Section 84.5(a) requires a recipient to submit to the Director an assurance that each of its programs and activities receiving or benefiting from Federal financial assistance from this Department will be conducted in compliance with this regulation. To facilitate the submission of assurances by thousands of Medicaid providers, the Department will follow the title VI procedures of accepting, in lieu of assurances, certification on Medicaid vouchers. Many commenters also sought relief from the paperwork requirements imposed by the Department's enforcement of its various civil rights responsibilities by requesting the Department to issue one form incorporating title VI, title IX, and section 504 assurances. The Secretary is sympathetic to this request. While it is not feasible to adopt a single civil rights assurance form at this time, the Office for Civil Rights will work toward that goal.</P>
              <P>8. <E T="03">Private rights of action.</E> Several comments urged that the regulation incorporate provision granting beneficiaries a private right of action against recipients under section 504. To confer such a right is beyond the authority of the executive branch of Government. There is, however, case law holding that such a right exists. <E T="03">Lloyd</E> v. <E T="03">Regional Transportation Authority,</E> 548 F. 2d 1277 (7th Cir. 1977); <E T="03">see Hairston</E> v. <E T="03">Drosick,</E> Civil No. 75-0691 (S.D. W. Va., Jan. 14, 1976); <E T="03">Gurmankin</E> v. <E T="03">Castanzo,</E> 411 F. Supp. 982 (E.D. Pa. 1976); <E T="03">cf. Lau</E> v. <E T="03">Nichols, supra.</E>
              </P>
              <P>9. <E T="03">Remedial action.</E> Where there has been a finding of discrimination, § 84.6 requires a recipient to take remedial action to overcome the effects of the discrimination. Actions that might be required under paragraph (a)(1) include provision of services to persons previously discriminated against, reinstatement of employees and development of a remedial action plan. Should a recipient fail to take required remedial action, the ultimate sanctions of court action or termination of Federal financial assistance may be imposed.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (a)(2) extends the responsibility for taking remedial action to a recipient that exercises control over a noncomplying recipient. Paragraph (a)(3) also makes clear that handicapped persons who are not in the program at the time that remedial action is required to be taken may also be the subject of such remedial action. This paragraph has been revised in response to comments in order to include persons who would have been in the program if discriminatory practices had not existed. Paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) have also been amended in response to comments to make plain that, in appropriate cases, remedial action might be required to redress clear violations of the statute itself that occurred before the effective date of this regulation.</P>
              <P>10. <E T="03">Voluntary action.</E> In § 84.6(b), the term “voluntary action” has been substituted for the term “affirmative action” because the use of the latter term led to some confusion. We believe the term “voluntary action” more accurately reflects the purpose of the paragraph. This provision allows action, beyond that required by the regulation, to overcome conditions that led to limited participation by handicapped persons, whether or not the limited participation was caused by any discriminatory actions on the part of the recipient. Several commenters urged <PRTPAGE P="488"/>that paragraphs (a) and (b) be revised to require remedial action to overcome effects of prior discriminatory practices regardless of whether there has been an express finding of discrimination. The self-evaluation requirement in paragraph (c) accomplishes much the same purpose.</P>
              <P>11. <E T="03">Self-evaluation.</E> Paragraph (c) requires recipients to conduct a self-evaluation in order to determine whether their policies or practices may discriminate against handicapped persons and to take steps to modify any discriminatory policies and practices and their effects. The Department received many comments approving of the addition to paragraph (c) of a requirement that recipients seek the assistance of handicapped persons in the self-evaluation process. This paragraph has been further amended to require consultation with handicapped persons or organizations representing them before recipients undertake the policy modifications and remedial steps prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii).</P>
              <P>Paragraph (c)(2), which sets forth the recordkeeping requirements concerning self-evaluation, now applies only to recipients with fifteen or more employees. This change was made as part of an effort to reduce unnecessary or counterproductive administrative obligations on small recipients. For those recipients required to keep records, the requirements have been made more specific; records must include a list of persons consulted and a description of areas examined, problems identified, and corrective steps taken. Moreover, the records must be made available for public inspection.</P>
              <P>12. <E T="03">Grievance procedure.</E> Section 84.7 (formerly § 84.8) requires recipients with fifteen or more employees to designate an individual responsible for coordinating its compliance efforts and to adopt a grievance procedure. Two changes were made in the section in response to comment. A general requirement that appropriate due process procedures be followed has been added. It was decided that the details of such procedures could not at this time be specified because of the varied nature of the persons and entities who must establish the procedures and of the programs to which they apply. A sentence was also added to make clear that grievance procedures are not required to be made available to unsuccessful applicants for employment or to applicants for admission to colleges and universities.</P>
              <P>The regulation does not require that grievance procedures be exhausted before recourse is sought from the Department. However, the Secretary believes that it is desirable and efficient in many cases for complainants to seek resolution of their complaints and disputes at the local level and therefore encourages them to use available grievance procedures.</P>
              <P>A number of comments asked whether compliance with this section or the notice requirements of § 84.8 could be coordinated with comparable action required by the title IX regulation. The Department encourages such efforts.</P>
              <P>13. <E T="03">Notice.</E> Section 84.8 (formerly § 84.9) sets forth requirements for dissemination of statements of nondicrimination policy by recipients.</P>
              <P>It is important that both handicapped persons and the public at large be aware of the obligations of recipients under section 504. Both the Department and recipients have responsibilities in this regard. Indeed the Department intends to undertake a major public information effort to inform persons of their rights under section 504 and this regulation. In § 84.8 the Department has sought to impose a clear obligation on major recipients to notify beneficiaries and employees of the requirements of section 504, without dictating the precise way in which this notice must be given. At the same time, we have avoided imposing requirements on small recipients (those with fewer than fifteen employees) that would create unnecessary and counterproductive paper work burdens on them and unduly stretch the enforcement resources of the Department.</P>
              <P>Section 84.8(a), as simplified, requires recipients with fifteen or more employees to take appropriate steps to notify beneficiaries and employees of the recipient's obligations under section 504. The last sentence of § 84.8(a) has been revised to list possible, rather than required, means of notification. Section 84.8(b) requires recipients to include a notification of their policy of nondiscrimination in recruitment and other general information materials.</P>
              <P>In response to a number of comments, § 84.8 has been revised to delete the requirements of publication in local newspapers, which has proved to be both troublesome and ineffective. Several commenters suggested that notification on separate forms be allowed until present stocks of publications and forms are depleted. The final regulation explicitly allows this method of compliance. The separate form should, however, be included with each significant publication or form that is distributed.</P>
              <P>Former § 84.9(b)(2), which prohibited the use of materials that might give the impression that a recipient excludes qualified handicapped persons from its program, has been deleted. The Department is convinced by the comments that this provision is unnecessary and difficult to apply. The Department encourages recipients, however, to include in their recruitment and other general information materials photographs of handicapped persons and ramps and other features of accessible buildings.</P>

              <P>Under new § 84.9 the Director may, under certain circumstances, require recipients <PRTPAGE P="489"/>with fewer than fifteen employees to comply with one or more of these requirements. Thus, if experience shows a need for imposing notice or other requirements on particular recipients or classes of small recipients, the Department is prepared to expand the coverage of these sections.</P>
              <P>14. <E T="03">Inconsistent State laws.</E> Section 84.10(a) states that compliance with the regulation is not excused by state or local laws limiting the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons to receive services or to practice an occupation. The provision thus applies only with respect to state or local laws that unjustifiably differentiate on the basis of handicap.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b) further points out that the presence of limited employment opportunities in a particular profession, does not excuse a recipient from complying with the regulation. Thus, a law school could not deny admission to a blind applicant because blind laywers may find it more difficult to find jobs that do nonhandicapped lawyers.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">subpart b—employment practices</HD>
              <P>Subpart B prescribes requirements for nondiscrimination in the employment practices of recipients of Federal financial assistance administered by the Department. This subpart is consistent with the employment provisions of the Department's regulation implementing title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (45 CFR part 86) and the regulation of the Department of Labor under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, which requries certain Federal contractors to take affirmative action in the employment and advancement of qualified handicapped persons. All recipients subject to title IX are also subject to this regulation. In addition, many recipients subject to this regulation receive Federal procurement contracts in excess of $2,500 and are therefore also subject to section 503.</P>
              <P>15. <E T="03">Discriminatory practices.</E> Section 84.11 sets forth general provisions with respect to discrimination in employment. A new paragraph (a)(2) has been added to clarify the employment obligations of recipients that receive Federal funds under Part B of the Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended (EHA). Section 606 of the EHA obligates elementary or secondary school systems that receive EHA funds to take positive steps to employ and advance in employment qualified handicapped persons. This obligation is similar to the nondiscrimination requirement of section 504 but requires recipients to take additional steps to hire and promote handicapped persons. In enacting section 606 Congress chose the words “positive steps” instead of “affirmative action” advisedly and did not intend section 606 to incorporate the types of activities required under Executive Order 11246 (affirmative action on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin) or under sections 501 and 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b) of § 84.11 sets forth the specific aspects of employment covered by the regulation. Paragraph (c) provides that inconsistent provisions of collective bargaining agreements do not excuse noncompliance.</P>
              <P>16. <E T="03">Reasonable accommodation.</E> The reasonable accommodation requirement of § 84.12 generated a substantial number of comments. The Department remains convinced that its approach is both fair and effective. Moreover, the Department of Labor reports that it has experienced little difficulty in administering the requirements of reasonable accommodation. The provision therefore remains basically unchanged from the proposed regulation.</P>
              <P>Section 84.12 requires a recipient to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of a handicapped applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. Where a handicapped person is not qualified to perform a particular job, where reasonable accommodation does not overcome the effects of a person's handicap, or where reasonable accommodation causes undue hardship to the employer, failure to hire or promote the handicapped person will not be considered discrimination.</P>
              <P>Section 84.12(b) lists some of the actions that constitute reasonable accommodation. The list is neither all-inclusive nor meant to suggest that employers must follow all of the actions listed.</P>
              <P>Reasonable accommodation includes modification of work schedules, including part-time employment, and job restructuring. Job restructuring may entail shifting nonessential duties to other employees. In other cases, reasonable accommodation may include physical modifications or relocation of particular offices or jobs so that they are in facilities or parts of facilities that are accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. If such accommodations would cause undue hardship to the employer, they need not be made.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (c) of this section sets forth the factors that the Office for Civil Rights will consider in determining whether an accommodation necessary to enable an applicant or employee to perform the duties of a job would impose an undue hardship. The weight given to each of these factors in making the determination as to whether an accommodation constitutes undue hardship will vary depending on the facts of a particular situation. Thus, a small day-care center might not be required to expend more than a nominal sum, such as that necessary to equip a telephone for use by a secretary with impaired hearing, but a large school district <PRTPAGE P="490"/>might be required to make available a teacher's aide to a blind applicant for a teaching job. Further, it might be considered reasonable to require a state welfare agency to accommodate a deaf employee by providing an interpreter, while it would constitute an undue hardship to impose that requirement on a provider of foster home care services. The reasonable accommodation standard in § 84.12 is similar to the obligation imposed upon Federal contractors in the regulation implementing section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, administered by the Department of Labor. Although the wording of the reasonable accommodation provisions of the two regulations is not identical, the obligation that the two regulations impose is the same, and the Federal Government's policy in implementing the two sections will be uniform. The Department adopted the factors listed in paragraph (c) instead of the “business necessity” standard of the Labor regulation because that term seemed inappropriate to the nature of the programs operated by the majority of institutions subject to this regulation, e.g., public school systems, hospitals, colleges and universities, nursing homes, day-care centers, and welfare offices. The factors listed in paragraph (c) are intended to make the rationale underlying the business necessity standard applicable to an understandable by recipients of HHS funds.</P>
              <P>17. <E T="03">Tests and selection criteria.</E> Revised § 84.13(a) prohibits employers from using test or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out handicapped persons unless the test or criterion is shown to be job-related and alternative tests or criteria that do not screen out or tend to screen out as many handicapped persons are not shown by the Director to be available. This paragraph is an application of the principle established under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in <E T="03">Griggs</E> v. <E T="03">Duke Power Company,</E> 401 U.S. 424 (1971).</P>
              <P>Under the proposed section, a statistical showing of adverse impact on handicapped persons was required to trigger an employer's obligation to show that employment criteria and qualifications relating to handicap were necessary. This requirement was changed because the small number of handicapped persons taking tests would make statistical showings of “disproportionate, adverse effect” difficult and burdensome. Under the altered, more workable provision, once it is shown that an employment test substantially limits the opportunities of handicapped persons, the employer must show the test to be job-related. A recipient is no longer limited to using predictive validity studies as the method for demonstrating that a test or other selection criterion is in fact job-related. Nor, in all cases, are predictive validity studies sufficient to demonstrate that a test or criterion is job-related. In addition, § 84.13(a) has been revised to place the burden on the Director, rather than the recipient, to identify alternate tests.</P>
              <P>Section 84.13(b) requires that a recipient take into account that some tests and criteria depend upon sensory, manual, or speaking skills that may not themselves be necessary to the job in question but that may make the handicapped person unable to pass the test. The recipient must select and administer tests so as best to ensure that the test will measure the handicapped person's ability to perform on the job rather than the person's ability to see, hear, speak, or perform manual tasks, except, of course, where such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure. For example, a person with a speech impediment may be perfectly qualified for jobs that do not or need not, with reasonable accommodation, require ability to speak clearly. Yet, if given an oral test, the person will be unable to perform in a satisfactory manner. The test results will not, therefore, predict job performance but instead will reflect impaired speech.</P>
              <P>18. <E T="03">Preemployment inquiries.</E> Section 84.14, concerning preemployment inquiries, generated a large number of comments. Commenters representing handicapped persons strongly favored a ban on preemployment inquiries on the ground that such inquiries are often used to discriminate against handicapped persons and are not necessary to serve any legitimate interests of employers. Some recipients, on the other hand, argued that preemployment inquiries are necessary to determine qualifications of the applicant, safety hazards caused by a particular handicapping condition, and accommodations that might required.</P>
              <P>The Secretary has concluded that a general prohibition of preemployment inquiries is appropriate. However, a sentence has been added to paragraph (a) to make clear that an employer may inquire into an applicant's ability to perform job-related tasks but may not ask if the person has a handicap. For example, an employer may not ask on an employment form if an applicant is visually impaired but may ask if the person has a current driver's license (if that is a necessary qualification for the position in question). Similarly, employers may make inquiries about an applicant's ability to perform a job safely. Thus, an employer may not ask if an applicant is an epileptic but may ask whether the person can perform a particular job without endangering other employees.</P>

              <P>Section 84.14(B) allows preemployment inquiries only if they are made in conjunction with required remedial action to correct past discrimination, with voluntary action to overcome past conditions that have limited the participation of handicapped persons, or with obligations under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In these instances, <PRTPAGE P="491"/>paragraph (b) specifies certain safeguards that must be followed by the employer.</P>
              <P>Finally, the revised provision allows an employer to condition offers of employment to handicapped persons on the results of medical examinations, so long as the examinations are administered to all employees in a nondiscriminatory manner and the results are treated on a confidential basis.</P>
              <P>19. <E T="03">Specific acts of Discrimination.</E> Sections 84.15 (recruitment), 84.16 (compensation), 84.17 (job classification and structure) and 84.18 (fringe benefits) have been deleted from the regulation as unnecessarily duplicative of § 84.11 (discrimination prohibited). The deletion of these sections in no way changes the substantive obligations of employers subject to this regulation from those set forth in the July 16 proposed regulation. These deletions bring the regulation closer in form to the Department of Labor's section 503 regulation.</P>
              <P>Proposed § 84.18, concerning fringe benefits, had allowed for differences in benefits or contributions between handicapped and nonhandicapped persons in situations only where such differences could be justified on an actuarial basis. Section 84.11 simply bars discrimination in providing fringe benefits and does not address the issue of actuarial differences. The Department believes that currently available data and experience do not demonstrate a basis for promulgating a regulation specifically allowing for differences in benefits or contributions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">subpart c—program accessibility</HD>
              <P>In general, subpart C prohibits the exclusion of qualified handicapped persons from federally assisted programs or activities because a recipient's facilities are inaccessible or unusable.</P>
              <P>20. <E T="03">Existing facilities.</E> Section 84.22 maintains the same standard for nondiscrimination in regard to existing facilities as was included in the proposed regulation. The section states that a recipient's program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, must be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Paragraphs (a) and (b) make clear that a recipient is not required to make each of its existing facilities accessible to handicapped persons if its program as a whole is accessible. Accessibility to the recipient's program or activity may be achieved by a number of means, including redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, and making aides available to beneficiaries. In choosing among methods of compliance, recipients are required to give priority consideration to methods that will be consistent with provision of services in the most appropriate integrated setting. Structural changes in existing facilities are required only where there is no other feasible way to make the recipient's program accessible.</P>
              <P>Under § 84.22, a university does not have to make all of its existing classroom buildings accessible to handicapped students if some of its buildings are already accessible and if it is possible to reschedule or relocate enough classes so as to offer all required courses and a reasonable selection of elective courses in accessible facilities. If sufficient relocation of classes is not possible using existing facilities, enough alterations to ensure program accessibility are required. A university may not exclude a handicapped student from a specifically requested course offering because it is not offered in an accessible location, but it need not make every section of that course accessible.</P>
              <P>Commenters representing several institutions of higher education have suggested that it would be appropriate for one postsecondary institution in a geographical area to be made accessible to handicapped persons and for other colleges and universities in that area to participate in that school's program, thereby developing an educational consortium for the postsecondary education of handicapped students. The Department believes that such a consortium, when developed and applied only to handicapped persons, would not constitute compliance with § 84.22, but would discriminate against qualified handicapped persons by restricting their choice in selecting institutions of higher education and would, therefore, be inconsistent with the basic objectives of the statute.</P>
              <P>Nothing in this regulation, however, should be read as prohibiting institutions from forming consortia for the benefit of all students. Thus, if three colleges decide that it would be cost-efficient for one college to offer biology, the second physics, and the third chemistry to all students at the three colleges, the arrangement would not violate section 504. On the other hand, it would violate the regulation if the same institutions set up a consortium under which one college undertook to make its biology lab accessible, another its physics lab, and a third its chemistry lab, and under which mobility-impaired handicapped students (but not other students) were required to attend the particular college that is accessible for the desired courses.</P>
              <P>Similarly, while a public school district need not make each of its buildings completely accessible, it may not make only one facility or part of a facility accessible if the result is to segregate handicapped students in a single setting.</P>

              <P>All recipients that proivde health, welfare, or other social services may also comply with § 84.22 by delivering services at alternate accessible sites or making home visits. Thus, for example, a pharmacist might arrange to make home deliveries of drugs. Under revised § 84.22(c), small providers of health, welfare, and social services (those <PRTPAGE P="492"/>with fewer than fifteen employees) may refer a beneficiary to an accessible provider of the desired service, but only if no means of meeting the program accessibility requirement other than a significant alteration in existing facilties is available. The referring recipient has the responsibility of determining that the other provider is in fact accessible and willing to provide the service. The Secretary believes this “last resort” referral provision is appropriate to avoid imposition of additional costs in the health care area, to encourage providers to remain in the Medicaid program, and to avoid imposing significant costs on small, low-budget providers such as day-care centers or foster homes.</P>
              <P>A recent change in the tax law may assist some recipients in meeting their obligations under this section. Under section 2122 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, recipients that pay federal income tax are eligible to claim a tax deduction of up to $25,000 for architectural and transportation modifications made to improve accessibility for handicapped persons. Many physicians and dentists, among others, may be eligible for this tax deduction. See 42 FR 17870 (April 4, 1977), adopting 26 CFR 7.190.</P>
              <P>Several commenters expressed concern about the feasibility of compliance with the program accessibility standard. The Secretary believes that the standard is flexible enough to permit recipients to devise ways to make their programs accessible short of extremely expensive or impractical physical changes in facilities. Accordingly, the section does not allow for waivers. The Department is ready at all times to provide technical assistance to recipients in meeting their program accessibility responsibilities. For this purpose, the Department is establishing a special technical assistance unit. Recipients are encouraged to call upon the unit staff for advice and guidance both on structural modifications and on other ways of meeting the program accessibility requirement.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (d) has been amended to require recipients to make all nonstructural adjustments necessary for meeting the program accessibility standard within sixty days. Only where structural changes in facilities are necessary will a recipient be permitted up to three years to accomplish program accessibility. It should be emphasized that the three-year time period is not a waiting period and that all changes must be accomplished as expeditiously as possible. Further, it is the Department's belief, after consultation with experts in the field, that outside ramps to buildings can be constructed quickly and at relatively low cost. Therefore, it will be expected that such structural additions will be made promptly to comply with § 84.22(d).</P>
              <P>The regulation continues to provide, as did the proposed version, that a recipient planning to achieve program accessibility by making structural changes must develop a transition plan for such changes within six months of the effective date of the regulation. A number of commenters suggested extending that period to one year. The secretary believes that such an extension is unnecessary and unwise. Planning for any necessary structural changes should be undertaken promptly to ensure that they can be completed within the three-year period. The elements of the transition plan as required by the regulation remain virtually unchanged from the proposal but § 84.22(d) now includes a requirement that the recipient make the plan available for public inspection.</P>
              <P>Several commenters expressed concern that the program accessibility standard would result in the segregation of handicapped persons in educational institutions. The regulation will not be applied to permit such a result. See § 84.4(c)(2)(iv), prohibiting unnecessarily separate treatment; § 84.35, requiring that students in elementary and secondary schools be educated in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs; and new § 84.43(d), applying the same standard to postsecondary education.</P>
              <P>We have received some comments from organizations of handicapped persons on the subject of requiring, over an extended period of time, a barrier-free environment—that is, requiring the removal of all architectural barriers in existing facilities. The Department has considered these comments but has decided to take no further action at this time concerning these suggestions, believing that such action should only be considered in light of experience in implementing the program accessibility standard.</P>
              <P>21. <E T="03">New construction.</E> Section 84.23 requires that all new facilities, as well as alterations that could affect access to and use of existing facilities, be designed and constructed in a manner so as to make the facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Section 84.23(a) has been amended so that it applies to each newly constructed facility if the construction was commenced after the effective date of the regulation. The words “if construction has commenced” will be considered to mean “if groundbreaking has takenplace.” Thus, a recipient will not be required to alter the design of a facility that has progressed beyond groundbreaking prior to the effective date of the regulation.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (b) requires certain alterations to conform to the requirement of physical accessibility in paragraph (a). If an alteration is undertaken to a portion of a building the accessibility of which could be improved by the manner in which the alteration is carried out, the alteration must be made in that manner. Thus, if a doorway or wall is being altered, the door or other wall <PRTPAGE P="493"/>opening must be made wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs. On the other hand, if the alteration consists of altering ceilings, the provisions of this section are not applicable because this alteration cannot be done in a way that affects the accessibility of that portion of the building. The phrase “to the maximum extent feasible” has been added to allow for the occasional case in which the nature of an existing facility is such as to make it impractical or prohibitively expensive to renovate the building in a manner that results in its being entirely barrier-free. In all such cases, however, the alteration should provide the maximum amount of physical accessibility feasible.</P>
              <P>As proposed, § 84.23(c) required compliance with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard on building accessibility as the minimum necessary for compliance with the accessibility requirement of § 84.23 (a) and (b). The regerence to the ANSI standard created some ambiguity, since the standard itself provides for waivers where other methods are equally effective in providing accessibility to the facility. Moreover, the Secretary does not wish to discourage innovation in barrier-free construction by requiring absolute adherence to a rigid design standard. Accordingly, § 84.23 (c) has been revised to permit departures from particular requirements of the ANSI standard where the recipient can demonstrate that equivalent access to the facility is provided.</P>
              <P>Section 84.23(d) of the proposed regulation, providing for a limited deferral of action concerning facilities that are subject to section 502 as well as section 504 of the Act, has been deleted. The Secretary believes that the provision is unnecessary and inappropriate to this regulation. The Department will, however, seek to coordinate enforcement activities under this regulation with those of the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">subpart d—preschool, elementary, and secondary education</HD>
              <P>Subpart D sets forth requirements for nondiscrimination in preschool, elementary, secondary, and adult education programs and activities, including secondary vocational education programs. In this context, the term “adult education” refers only to those educational programs and activities for adults that are operated by elementary and secondary schools.</P>
              <P>The provisions of Subpart D apply to state and local educational agencies. Although the subpart applies, in general, to both public and private education programs and activities that are federally assisted, §§ 84.32 and 84.33 apply only to public programs and § 84.39 applies only to private programs; §§ 84.35 and 84.36 apply both to public programs and to those private programs that include special services for handicapped students.</P>

              <P>Subpart B generally conforms to the standards established for the education of handicapped persons in <E T="03">Mills</E> v. <E T="03">Board of Education</E> of the District of Columbia, 348 F. Supp. 866 (D.D.C. 1972), <E T="03">Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children</E> v. <E T="03">Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,</E> 344 F. Supp. 1257 (E.D. 1971), 343 F. Supp. 279 (E.D. Pa. 1972), and <E T="03">Lebanks</E> v. <E T="03">Spears,</E> 60, F.R.D. 135 (E.D. La. 1973), as well as in the Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended by Pub. L. 94-142 (the EHA).</P>
              <P>The basic requirements common to those cases, to the EHA, and to this regulation are (1) that handicapped persons, regardless of the nature or severity of their handicap, be provided a free appropriate public education, (2) that handicapped students be educated with nonhandicapped students to the maximum extent appropriate to their needs, (3) that educational agencies undertake to identify and locate all unserved handicapped children, (4) that evaluation procedures be improved in order to avoid the inappropriate education that results from the misclassification of students, and (5) that procedural safeguard be established to enable parents and guardians to influence decisions regarding the evaluation and placement of their children. These requirements are designed to ensure that no handicapped child is excluded from school on the basis of handicap and, if a recipient demonstrates that placement in a regular educational setting cannot be achieved satisfactorily, that the student is provided with adequate alternative services suited to the student's needs without additional cost to the student's parents or guardian. Thus, a recipient that operates a public school system must either educate handicapped children in its regular program or provide such children with an appropriate alternative education at public expense.</P>
              <P>It is not the intention of the Department, except in extraordinary circumstances, to review the result of individual placement and other educational decisions, so long as the school district complies with the “process” requirements of this subpart (concerning identification and location, evaluation, and due process procedures). However, the Department will place a high priority on investigating cases which may involve exclusion of a child from the education system or a pattern or practice of discriminatory placements or education.</P>
              <P>22. <E T="03">Location and notification.</E> Section 84.32 requires public schools to take steps annually to identify and locate handicapped children who are not receiving an education and to publicize to handicapped children and their parents the rights and duties established by section 504 and this regulation. This section has been shortened without substantive change.<PRTPAGE P="494"/>
              </P>
              <P>23. <E T="03">Free appropriate public education.</E> Former §§ 84.34 (“Free education”) and 84.36(a) (“Suitable education”) have been consolidated and revised in new § 84.33. Under § 84.34(a), a recipient is responsible for providing a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's jurisdiction. The word “in” encompasses the concepts of both domicile and actual residence. If a recipient places a child in a program other than its own, it remains financially responsible for the child, whether or not the other program is operated by another recipient or educational agency. Moreover, a recipient may not place a child in a program that is inappropriate or that otherwise violates the requirements of Subpart D. And in no case may a recipient refuse to provide services to a handicapped child in its jurisdiction because of another person's or entity's failure to assume financial responsibility.</P>
              <P>Section 84.33(b) concerns the provision of appropriate educational services to handicapped children. To be appropriate, such services must be designed to meet handicapped children's individual educational needs to the same extent that those of nonhandicapped children are met. An appropriate education could consist of education in regular classes, education in regular classes with the use of supplementary services, or special education and related services. Special education may include specially designed instruction in classrooms, at home, or in private or public institutions and may be accompanied by such related services as developmental, corrective, and other supportive services (including psychological, counseling, and medical diagnostic services). The placement of the child must however, be consistent with the requirements of § 84.34 and be suited to his or her educational needs.</P>
              <P>The quality of the educational services provided to handicapped students must equal that of the services provided to nonhandicapped students; thus, handicapped student's teachers must be trained in the instruction of persons with the handicap in question and appropriate materials and equipment must be available. The Department is aware that the supply of adequately trained teachers may, at least at the outset of the imposition of this requirement, be insufficient to meet the demand of all recipients. This factor will be considered in determining the appropriateness of the remedy for noncompliance with this section. A new § 84.33(b)(2) has been added, which allows this requirement to be met through the full implementation of an individualized education program developed in accordance with the standards of the EHA.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (c) of § 84.33 sets forth the specific financial obligations of a recipient. If a recipient does not itself provide handicapped persons with the requisite services, it must assume the cost of any alternate placement. If, however, a recipient offers adequate services and if alternate placement is chosen by a student's parent or guardian, the recipient need not assume the cost of the outside services. (If the parent or guardian believes that his or her child cannot be suitably educated in the recipient's program, he or she may make use of the procedures established in § 84.36.) Under this paragraph, a recipient's obligation extends beyond the provision of tuition payments in the case of placement outside the regular program. Adequate transportation must also be provided. Recipients must also pay for psychological services and those medical services necessary for diagnostic and evaluative purposes.</P>
              <P>If the recipient places a student, because of his or her handicap, in a program that necessitates his or her being away from home, the payments must also cover room and board and nonmedical care (including custodial and supervisory care). When residential care is necessitated not by the student's handicap but by factors such as the student's home conditions, the recipient is not required to pay the cost of room and board.</P>
              <P>Two new sentences have been added to paragraph (c)(1) to make clear that a recipient's financial obligations need not be met solely through its own funds. Recipients may rely on funds from any public or private source including insurers and similar third parties.</P>
              <P>The EHA requires a free appropriate education to be provided to handicapped children “no later than September 1, 1978,” but section 504 contains no authority for delaying enforcement. To resolve this problem, a new paragraph (d) has been added to § 84.33. Section 84.33(d) requires recipients to achieve full compliance with the free appropriate public education requirements of § 84.33 as expeditiously as possible, but in no event later than September 1, 1978. The provision also makes clear that, as of the effective date of this regulation, no recipient may exclude a qualified handicapped child from its educational program. This provision against exclusion is consistent with the order of providing services set forth in section 612(3) of the EHA, which places the highest priority on providing services to handicapped children who are not receiving an education.</P>
              <P>24. <E T="03">Educational setting.</E> Section 84.34 prescribes standards for educating handicapped persons with nonhandicapped persons to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the handicapped person in question. A handicapped student may be removed from the regular educational setting only where the recipient can show that the needs of the student would, on balance, be served by placement in another setting.<PRTPAGE P="495"/>
              </P>
              <P>Although under § 84.34, the needs of the handicapped person are determinative as to proper placement, it should be stressed that, where a handicapped student is so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other students is significantly impaired, the needs of the handicapped child cannot be met in that environment. Therefore, regular placement would not be appropriate to his or her needs and would not be required by § 84.34.</P>
              <P>Among the factors to be considered in placing a child is the need to place the child as close to home as possible. A new sentence has been added to paragraph (a) requiring recipients to take this factor into account. As pointed out in several comments, the parents' right under § 84.36 to challenge the placement of their child extends not only to placement in special classes or separate schools but also to placement in a distant school and, in particular, to residential placement. An equally appropriate educational program may exist closer to home; this issue may be raised by the parent or guardian under §§ 84.34 and 84.36.</P>
              <P>New paragraph (b) specified that handicapped children must also be provided nonacademic services in as integrated a setting as possible. This requirement is especially important for children whose educational needs necessitate their being solely with other handicapped children during most of each day. To the maximum extent appropriate, children in residential settings are also to be provided opportunities for participation with other children.</P>
              <P>Section 84.34(c) (formerly § 84.38) requires that any facilities that are identifiable as being for handicapped students be comparable in quality to other facilities of the recipient. A number of comments objected to this section on the basis that it encourages the creation and maintenance of such facilities. This is not the intent of the provision. A separate facility violates section 504 unless it is indeed necessary to the provision of an appropriate education to certain handicapped students. In those instances in which such facilities are necessary (as might be the case, for example, for severely retarded persons), this provision requires that the educational services provided be comparable to those provided in the facilities of the recipient that are not identifiable as being for handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>25. <E T="03">Evaluation and placement.</E> Because the failure to provide handicapped persons with an appropriate education is so frequently the result of misclassification or misplacement, § 84.33(b)(1) makes compliance with its provisions contingent upon adherence to certain procedures designed to ensure appropriate classification and placement. These procedures, delineated in §§ 84.35 and 84.36, are concerned with testing and other evaluation methods and with procedural due process rights.</P>
              <P>Section 84.35(a) requires that an individual evaluation be conducted before any action is taken with respect either to the initial placement of a handicapped child in a regular or special education program or to any subsequent significant change in that placement. Thus, a full reevaluation is not required every time an adjustment in placement is made. “Any action” includes denials of placement.</P>
              <P>Paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 84.35 establishes procedures designed to ensure that children are not misclassified, unnecessarily labeled as being handicapped, or incorrectly placed because of inappropriate selection, administration, or interpretation of evaluation materials. This problem has been extensively documented in “Issues in the Classification of Children,” a report by the Project on Classification of Exceptional Children, in which the HHS Interagency Task Force participated. The provisions of these paragraphs are aimed primarily at abuses in the placement process that result from misuse of, or undue or misplaced reliance on, standardized scholastic aptitude tests.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b) has been shortened but not substantively changed. The requirement in former subparagraph (1) that recipients provide and administer evaluation materials in the native language of the student has been deleted as unnecessary, since the same requirement already exists under title VI and is more appropriately covered under that statute. Subparagraphs (1) and (2) are, in general, intended to prevent misinterpretation and similar misuse of test scores and, in particular, to avoid undue reliance on general intelligence tests. Subparagraph (3) requires a recipient to administer tests to a student with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills in whatever manner is necessary to avoid distortion of the test results by the impairment. Former subparagraph (4) has been deleted as unnecessarily repetitive of the other provisions of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (c) requires a recipient to draw upon a variety of sources in the evaluation process so that the possibility of error in classification is minimized. In particular, it requires that all significant factors relating to the learning process, including adaptive behavior, be considered. (Adaptive behavior is the effectiveness with which the individual meets the standards of personal independence and social responsibility expected of his or her age and cultural group.) Information from all sources must be documented and considered by a group of persons, and the procedure must ensure that the child is placed in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>

              <P>The proposed regulation would have required a complete individual reevaluation of the student each year. The Department has <PRTPAGE P="496"/>concluded that it is inappropriate in the section 504 regulation to require full reevaluations on such a rigid schedule. Accordingly, § 84.35(c) requires periodic reevaluations and specifies that reevaluations in accordance with the EHA will constitute compliance. The proposed regulation implementing the EHA allows reevaluation at three-year intervals except under certain specified circumstances.</P>
              <P>Under § 84.36, a recipient must establish a system of due process procedures to be afforded to parents or guardians before the recipient takes any action regarding the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a person who, because of handicap, needs or is believed to need special education or related services. This section has been revised. Because the due process procedures of the EHA, incorporated by reference in the proposed section 504 regulation, are inappropriate for some recipients not subject to that Act, the section now specifies minimum necessary procedures: notice, a right to inspect records, an impartial hearing with a right to representation by counsel, and a review procedure. The EHA procedures remain one means of meeting the regulation's due process requirements, however, and are recommended to recipients as a model.</P>
              <P>26. <E T="03">Nonacademic services.</E> Section 84.37 requires a recipient to provide nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in such manner as is necessary to afford handicapped students an equal opportunity for participation. Because these services and activities are part of a recipient's education program, they must, in accordance with the provisions of § 84.34, be provided in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
              <P>Revised paragraph (c)(2) does permit separation or differentiation with respect to the provision of physical education and athletics activities, but only if qualified handicapped students are also allowed the opportunity to compete for regular teams or participate in regular activities. Most handicapped students are able to participate in one or more regular physical education and athletics activities. For example, a student in a wheelchair can participate in regular archery course, as can a deaf student in a wrestling course.</P>
              <P>Finally, the one-year transition period provided in former § 84.37(a)(3) was deleted in response to the almost unanimous objection of commenters to that provision.</P>
              <P>27. <E T="03">Preschool and adult education.</E> Section 84.38 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in preschool and adult education programs. Former paragraph (b), which emphasized that compensatory programs for disadvantaged children are subject to section 504, has been deleted as unnecessary, since it is comprehended by paragraph (a).</P>
              <P>28. <E T="03">Private education.</E> Section 84.39 sets forth the requirements applicable to recipients that operate private education programs and activities. The obligations of these recipients have been changed in two significant respects: First, private schools are subject to the evaluation and due process provisions of the subpart only if they operate special education programs; second, under § 84.39(b), they may charge more for providing services to handicapped students than to nonhandicapped students to the extent that additional charges can be justified by increased costs.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (a) of § 84.39 is intended to make clear that recipients that operate private education programs and activities are not required to provide an appropriate education to handicapped students with special educational needs if the recipient does not offer programs designed to meet those needs. Thus, a private school that has no program for mentally retarded persons is neither required to admit such a person into its program nor to arrange or pay for the provision of the person's education in another program. A private recipient without a special program for blind students, however, would not be permitted to exclude, on the basis of blindness, a blind applicant who is able to participate in the regular program with minor adjustments in the manner in which the program is normally offered.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">subpart e—postsecondary education</HD>
              <P>Subpart E prescribes requirements for nondiscrimination in recruitment, admission, and treatment of students in postsecondary education programs and activities, including vocational education.</P>
              <P>29. <E T="03">Admission and recruitment.</E> In addition to a general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of handicap in § 84.42(a), the regulation delineates, in § 84.42(b), specific prohibitions concerning the establishment of limitations on admission of handicapped students, the use of tests or selection criteria, and preadmission inquiry. Several changes have been made in this provision.</P>
              <P>Section 84.42(b) provides that postsecondary educational institutions may not use any test or criterion for admission that has a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons unless it has been validated as a predictor of academic success and alternate tests or criteria with a less disproportionate, adverse effect are shown by the Department to be available. There are two significant changes in this approach from the July 16 proposed regulation.</P>

              <P>First, many commenters expressed concern that § 84.42(b)(2)(ii) could be interpreted to require a “global search” for alternate tests that do not have a disproportionate, adverse impact on handicapped persons. this was not the intent of the provision and, therefore, it has been amended to place the burden on the Director of the Office for Civil Rights, rather <PRTPAGE P="497"/>than on the recipient, to identify alternate tests.</P>
              <P>Second, a new paragraph (d), concerning validity studies, has been added. Under the proposed regulation, overall success in an education program, not just first-year grades, was the criterion against which admissions tests were to be validated. This approach has been changed to reflect the comment of professional testing services that use of first year grades would be less disruptive of present practice and that periodic validity studies against overall success in the education program would be sufficient check on the reliability of first-year grades.</P>
              <P>Section 84.42(b)(3) also requires a recipient to assure itself that admissions tests are selected and administered to applicants with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills in such manner as is necessary to avoid unfair distortion of test results. Methods have been developed for testing the aptitude and achievement of persons who are not able to take written tests or even to make the marks required for mechanically scored objective tests; in addition, methods for testing persons with visual or hearing impairments are available. A recipient, under this paragraph, must assure itself that such methods are used with respect to the selection and administration of any admissions tests that it uses.</P>

              <P>Section 84.42(b)(3)(iii) has been amended to require that admissions tests be administered in facilities that, on the whole, are accessible. In this context, <E T="03">on the whole</E> means that not all of the facilities need be accessible so long as a sufficient number of facilities are available to handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>Revised § 84.42(b)(4) generally prohibits preadmission inquiries as to whether an applicant has a handicap. The considerations that led to this revision are similar to those underlying the comparable revision of § 84.14 on preemployment inquiries. The regulation does, however, allow inquiries to be made, after admission but before enrollment, as to handicaps that may require accommodation.</P>
              <P>New paragraph (c) parallels the section on preemployment inquiries and allows postsecondary institutions to inquire about applicants' handicaps before admission, subject to certain safeguards, if the purpose of the inquiry is to take remedial action to correct past discrimination or to take voluntary action to overcome the limited participation of handicapped persons in postsecondary educational institutions.</P>
              <P>Proposed § 84.42(c), which would have allowed different admissions criteria in certain cases for handicapped persons, was widely misinterpreted in comments from both handicapped persons and recipients. We have concluded that the section is unnecessary, and it has been deleted.</P>
              <P>30. <E T="03">Treatment of students.</E> Section 84.43 contains general provisions prohibiting the discriminatory treatment of qualified handicapped applicants. Paragraph (b) requires recipients to ensure that equal opportunities are provided to its handicapped students in education programs and activities that are not operated by the recipient. The recipient must be satisfied that the outside education program or activity as a whole is nondiscriminatory. For example, a college must ensure that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur in connection with teaching assignments of student teachers in elementary or secondary schools not operated by the college. Under the “as a whole” wording, the college could continue to use elementary or secondary school systems that discriminate if, and only if, the college's student teaching program, when viewed in its entirety, offered handicapped student teachers the same range and quality of choice in student teaching assignments afforded nonhandicapped students.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (c) of this section prohibits a recipient from excluding qualified handicapped students from any course, course of study, or other part of its education program or activity. This paragraph is designed to eliminate the practice of excluding handicapped persons from specific courses and from areas of concentration because of factors such as ambulatory difficulties of the student or assumptions by the recipient that no job would be available in the area in question for a person with that handicap.</P>
              <P>New paragraph (d) requires postsecondary institutions to operate their programs and activities so that handicapped students are provided services in the most integrated setting appropriate. Thus, if a college had several elementary physics classes and had moved one such class to the first floor of the science building to accommodate students in wheelchairs, it would be a violation of this paragraph for the college to concentrate handicapped students with no mobility impairments in the same class.</P>
              <P>31. <E T="03">Academic adjustments.</E> Paragraph (a) of § 84.44 requires that a recipient make certain adjustments to academic requirements and practices that discriminate or have the effect of discriminating on the basis of handicap. This requirement, like its predecessor in the proposed regulation, does not obligate an institution to waive course or other academic requirements. But such institutions must accommodate those requirements to the needs of individual handicapped students. For example, an institution might permit an otherwise qualified handicapped student who is deaf to substitute an art appreciation or music history course for a required course in music appreciation or could modify the manner in which the music appreciation course is conducted for the deaf student. It shoud be stressed that academic requirements that can be demonstrated by the recipient to be essential to its program <PRTPAGE P="498"/>of instruction or to particular degrees need not be changed.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b) provides that postsecondary institutions may not impose rules that have the effect of limiting the participation of handicapped students in the education program. Such rules include prohibition of tape recorders or braillers in classrooms and dog guides in campus buildings. Several recipients expressed concern about allowing students to tape record lectures because the professor may later want to copyright the lectures. This problem may be solved by requiring students to sign agreements that they will not release the tape recording or transcription or otherwise hinder the professor's ability to obtain a copyright.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (c) of this section, concerning the administration of course examinations to students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, parallels the regulation's provisions on admissions testing (§ 84.42(b)) and will be similarly interpreted.</P>
              <P>Under § 84.44(d), a recipient must ensure that no handicapped student is subject to discrimination in the recipient's program because of the absence of necessary auxiliary educational aids. Colleges and universities expressed concern about the costs of compliance with this provision.</P>
              <P>The Department emphasizes that recipients can usually meet this obligation by assisting students in using existing resources for auxiliary aids such as state vocational rehabilitation agencies and private charitable organizations. Indeed, the Department anticipates that the bulk of auxiliary aids will be paid for by state and private agencies, not by colleges or universities. In those circumstances where the recipient institution must provide the educational auxiliary aid, the institution has flexibility in choosing the methods by which the aids will be supplied. For example, some universities have used students to work with the institution's handicapped students. Other institutions have used existing private agencies that tape texts for handicapped students free of charge in order to reduce the number of readers needed for visually impaired students.</P>
              <P>As long as no handicapped person is excluded from a program because of the lack of an appropriate aid, the recipient need not have all such aids on hand at all times. Thus, readers need not be available in the recipient's library at all times so long as the schedule of times when a reader is available is established, is adhered to, and is sufficient. Of course, recipients are not required to maintain a complete braille library.</P>
              <P>32. <E T="03">Housing.</E> Section 84.45(a) requires postsecondary institutions to provide housing to handicapped students at the same cost as they provide it to other students and in a convenient, accessible, and comparable manner. Commenters, particularly blind persons pointed out that some handicapped persons can live in any college housing and need not wait to the end of the transition period in Subpart C to be offered the same variety and scope of housing accommodations given to nonhandicapped persons. The Department concurs with this position and will interpret this section accordingly.</P>
              <P>A number of colleges and universities reacted negatively to paragraph (b) of this section. It provides that, if a recipient assists in making off-campus housing available to its students, it should develop and implement procedures to assure itself that off-campus housing, as a whole, is available to handicapped students. Since postsecondary institutions are presently required to assure themselves that off-campus housing is provided in a manner that does not discriminate on the basis of sex (§ 86.32 of the title IX regulation), they may use the procedures developed under title IX in order to comply with § 84.45(b). It should be emphasized that not every off-campus living accommodation need be made accessible to handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>33. <E T="03">Health and insurance.</E> Section 84.46 of the proposed regulation, providing that recipients may not discriminate on the basis of handicap in the provision of health related services, has been deleted as duplicative of the general provisions of § 84.43. This deletion represents no change in the obligation of recipients to provide nondiscriminatory health and insurance plans. The Department will continue to require that nondiscriminatory health services be provided to handicapped students. Recipients are not required, however, to provide specialized services and aids to handicapped persons in health programs. If, for example, a college infirmary treats only simple disorders such as cuts, bruises, and colds, its obligation to handicapped persons is to treat such disorders for them.</P>
              <P>34. <E T="03">Financial assistance.</E> Section 84.46(a) (formerly § 84.47), prohibiting discrimination in providing financial assistance, remains substantively the same. It provides that recipients may not provide less assistance to or limit the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons for such assistance, whether the assistance is provided directly by the recipient or by another entity through the recipient's sponsorship. Awards that are made under wills, trusts, or similar legal instruments in a discriminatory manner are permissible, but only if the overall effect of the recipient's provision of financial assistance is not discriminatory on the basis of handicap.</P>

              <P>It will not be considered discriminatory to deny, on the basis of handicap, an athletic scholarship to a handicapped person if the handicap renders the person unable to qualify for the award. For example, a student who has a neurological disorder might be denied a varsity football scholarship on the basis of his inability to play football, but a <PRTPAGE P="499"/>deaf person could not, on the basis of handicap, be denied a scholarship for the school's diving team. The deaf person could, however, be denied a scholarship on the basis of comparative diving ability.</P>
              <P>Commenters on § 84.46(b), which applies to assistance in obtaining outside employment for students, expressed similar concerns to those raised under § 84.43(b), concerning cooperative programs. This paragraph has been changed in the same manner as § 84.43(b) to include the “as a whole” concept and will be interpreted in the same manner as § 84.43(b).</P>
              <P>35. <E T="03">Nonacademic services.</E> Section 84.47 (formerly § 84.48) establishes nondiscrimination standards for physical education and athletics counseling and placement services, and social organizations. This section sets the same standards as does § 84.38 of Subpart D, discussed above, and will be interpreted in a similar fashion.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">subpart f—health, welfare, and social services</HD>
              <P>Subpart F applies to recipients that operate health, welfare, and social service programs. The Department received fewer comments on this subpart than on others.</P>
              <P>Although many commented that Subpart F lacked specificity, these commenters provided neither concrete suggestions nor additions. Nevertheless, some changes have been made, pursuant to comment, to clarify the obligations of recipients in specific areas. In addition, in an effort to reduce duplication in the regulation, the section governing recipients providing health services (proposed § 84.52) has been consolidated with the section regulating providers of welfare and social services (proposed § 84.53). Since the separate provisions that appeared in the proposed regulation were almost identical, no substantive change should be inferred from their consolidation.</P>
              <P>Several commenters asked whether Subpart F applies to vocational rehabilitation agencies whose purpose is to assist in the rehabilitation of handicapped persons. To the extent that such agencies receive financial assistance from the Department, they are covered by Subpart F and all other relevant subparts of the regulation. Nothing in this regulation, however, precludes such agencies from servicing only handicapped persons. Indeed, § 84.4(c) permits recipients to offer services or benefits that are limited by federal law to handicapped persons or classes of handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>Many comments suggested requiring state health, welfare, and social service agencies to take an active role in the enforcement of section 504 with regard to local health and social service providers. The Department believes that the possibility for federal-state cooperation in the administration and enforcement of section 504 warrants further consideration. Moreover, the Department will rely largely on state Medicaid agencies, as it has under title VI, for monitoring compliance by individual Medicaid providers.</P>
              <P>A number of comments also discussed whether section 504 should be read to require payment of compensation to institutionalized handicapped patients who perform services for the institution in which they reside. The Department of Labor has recently issued a proposed regulation under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that covers the question of compensation for institutionalized persons, 42 FR 15224 (March 18, 1977). This Department will seek information and comment from the Department of Labor concerning that agency's experience administering the FLSA regulation.</P>
              <P>36. <E T="03">Health, welfare, and other social service providers.</E> As already noted, § 84.53 has been combined with proposed § 84.53 into a single section covering health, welfare, and other social services. Section 84.52(a) has been expanded in several respects. The addition of new paragraph (a)(2) is intended to make clear the basic requirement of equal opportunity to receive benefits or services in the health, welfare, and social service areas. The paragraph parallels §§ 84.4(b)(ii) and 84.43(b). New paragraph (a)(3) requires the provision of effective benefits or services, as defined in § 84.4(b)(2) (i.e., benefits or services which “afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result (or) to gain the same benefit * * *”).</P>
              <P>Section 84.52(a) also includes provisions concerning the limitation of benefits or services to handicapped persons and the subjection of handicapped persons to different eligibility standards. (These provisions were previously included in the welfare recipient section (§ 84.53(a)).) One common misconception about the regulation is that it would require specialized hospitals and other health care providers to treat all handicapped persons. The regulation makes no such requirement. Thus, a burn treatment center need not provide other types of medical treatment to handicapped persons unless it provides such medical services to nonhandicapped persons. It could not, however, refuse to treat the burns of a deaf person because of his or her deafness.</P>
              <P>Commenters had raised the question of whether the prohibition against different standards of eligibility might preclude recipients from providing special services to handicapped persons or classes of handicapped persons. The regulation will not be so interpreted, and the specific section in question has been eliminated. Section 84.4(c) makes clear that special programs for handicapped persons are permitted.</P>

              <P>A new paragraph (a)(5) concerning the provision of different or separate services or benefits has been added. This provision prohibits such treatment unless necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with <PRTPAGE P="500"/>benefits and services that are as effective as those provided to others.</P>
              <P>Section 84.52(a)(2) of the proposed regulation has been omitted as duplicative of revised § 84.22 (b) and (c) in Subpart C. As discussed above, these sections permit health care providers to arrange to meet patients in accessible facilities and to make referrals in carefully limited circumstances.</P>
              <P>Section 84.52(a)(3) of the proposed regulation has been redesignated § 84.52(b) and has been amended to cover written material concerning waivers of rights or consent to treatment as well as general notices concerning health benefits or services. The section requires the recipient to ensure that qualified handicapped persons are not denied effective notice because of their handicap. For example, recipients could use several different types of notice in order to reach persons with impaired vision or hearing, such as brailled messages, radio spots, and tacticle devices on cards or envelopes to inform blind persons of the need to call the recipient for further information.</P>
              <P>Sections 84.52(a)(4), 84.52(a)(5), and 84.52(b) have been omitted from the regulation as unnecessary. They are clearly comprehended by the more general sections banning discrimination.</P>
              <P>Section 84.52(c) is a new section requiring recipient hospitals to establish a procedure for effective communication with persons with impaired hearing for the purpose of providing emergency health care. Although it would be appropriate for a hospital to fulfill its responsibilities under this section by having a full-time interpreter for the deaf on staff, there may be other means of accomplishing the desired result of assuring that some means of communication is immediately available for deaf persons needing emergency treatment.</P>
              <P>Section 84.52(d), also a new provision, requires recipients with fifteen or more employees to provide appropriate auxiliary aids for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills. Further, the Director may require a small provider to furnish auxiliary aids where the provision of aids would not adversely affect the ability of the recipient to provide its health benefits or service. Thus although a small nonprofit neighborhood clinic might not be obligated to have available an interpreter for deaf persons, the Director may require provision of such aids as may be reasonably available to ensure that qualified handicapped persons are not denied appropriate benefits or services because of their handicaps.</P>
              <P>37. <E T="03">Treatment of Drug Addicts and Alcoholics.</E> Section 84.53 is a new section that prohibits discrimination in the treatment and admission of drug and alcohol addicts to hospitals and outpatient facilities. This section is included pursuant to section 407, Pub. L. 92-255, the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972 (21 U.S.C. 1174), as amended, and section 321, Public Law 91-616, the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4581), as amended, and section 321, Public Law 93-282. Section 504 itself also prohibits such discriminatory treatment and, in addition, prohibits similar discriminatory treatment by other types of health providers. Section 84.53 prohibits discrimination against drug abusers by operators of outpatient facilities, despite the fact that section 407 pertains only to hospitals, because of the broader application of section 504. This provision does not mean that all hospitals and outpatient facilities must treat drug addiction and alcoholism. It simply means, for example, that a cancer clinic may not refuse to treat cancer patients simply because they are also alcoholics.</P>
              <P>38. <E T="03">Education of institutionalized persons.</E> The regulation retains § 84.54 of the proposed regulation that requires that an appropriate education be provided to qualified handicapped persons who are confined to residential institutions or day care centers.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">subpart g—procedures</HD>
              <P>In § 84.61, the Secretary has adopted the title VI complaint and enforcement procedures for use in implementing section 504 until such time as they are superseded by the issuance of a consolidated procedural regulation applicable to all of the civil rights statutes and executive orders administered by the Department.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix C to Part 84—Guidelines Relating to Health Care for Handicapped Infants</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Interpretative guidelines relating to the applicability of this part to health care for handicapped infants.</E> The following are interpretative guidelines of the Department set forth here to assist recipients and the public in understanding the Department's interpretation of section 504 and the regulations contained in this part as applied to matters concerning health care for handicapped infants. These interpretative guidelines are illustrative; they do not independently establish rules of conduct.<PRTPAGE P="501"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) With respect to programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance, health care providers may not, solely on the basis of present or anticipated physical or mental impairments of an infant, withhold treatment or nourishment from the infant who, in spite of such impairments, will medically benefit from the treatment or nourishment.</P>
              <P>(2) Futile treatment or treatment that will do no more than temporarily prolong the act of dying of a terminally ill infant is not considered treatment that will medically benefit the infant.</P>
              <P>(3) In determining whether certain possible treatments will be medically beneficial to an infant, reasonable medical judgments in selecting among alternative courses of treatment will be respected.</P>
              <P>(4) Section 504 and the provisions of this part are not applicable to parents (who are not recipients of Federal financial assistance). However, each recipient health care provider must in all aspects of its health care programs receiving Federal financial assistance provide health care and related services in a manner consistent with the requirements of section 504 and this part. Such aspects includes decisions on whether to report, as required by State law or otherwise, to the appropriate child protective services agency a suspected instance of medical neglect of a child, or to take other action to seek review or parental decisions to withhold consent for medically indicated treatment. Whenever parents make a decision to withhold consent for medically beneficial treatment or nourishment, such recipient providers may not, solely on the basis of the infant's present or anticipated future mental or physical impairments, fail to follow applicable procedures on reporting such incidents to the child protective services agency or to seek judicial review.</P>
              <P>(5) The following are examples of applying these interpretative guidelines. These examples are stated in the context of decisions made by recipient health care providers. Were these decisions made by parents, the guideline stated in section (a)(4) would apply. These examples assume no facts or complications other than those stated. Because every case must be examined on its individual facts, these are merely illustrative examples to assist in understanding the framework for applying the nondiscrimination requirements of section 504 and this part.</P>
              <P>(i) Withholding of medically beneficial surgery to correct an intestinal obstruction in an infant with Down's Syndrome when the withholding is based upon the anticipated future mental retardation of the infant and there are no medical contraindications to the surgery that would otherwise justify withholding the surgery would constitute a discriminatory act, violative of section 504.</P>
              <P>(ii) Withholding of treatment for medically correctable physical anomalies in children born with spina bifida when such denial is based on anticipated mental impairment paralysis or incontinence of the infant, rather than on reasonable medical judgments that treatment would be futile, too unlikely of success given complications in the particular case, or otherwise not of medical benefit to the infant, would constitute a discriminatory act, violative of section 504.</P>
              <P>(iii) Withholding of medical treatment for an infant born with anencephaly, who will inevitably die within a short period of time, would not constitute a discriminatory act because the treatment would be futile and do no more than temporarily prolong the act of dying.</P>
              <P>(iv) Withholding of certain potential treatments from a severely premature and low birth weight infant on the grounds of reasonable medical judgments concerning the improbability of success or risks of potential harm to the infant would not violate section 504.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Guidelines for HHS investigations relating to health care for handicapped infants.</E> The following are guidelines of the Department in conducting investigations relating to health care for handicapped infants. They are set forth here to assist recipients and the public in understanding applicable investigative procedures. These guidelines do not establish rules of conduct, create or affect legally enforceable rights of any person, or modify existing rights, authorities or responsibilities pursuant to this part. These guidelines reflect the Department's recognition of the special circumstances presented in connection with complaints of suspected life-threatening noncompliance with this part involving health care for handicapped infants. These guidelines do not apply to other investigations pursuant to this part, or other civil rights statutes and rules. Deviations from these guidelines may occur when, in the judgment of the responsible Department official, other action is necessary to protect the life or health of a handicapped infant.</P>

              <P>(1) Unless impracticable, whenever the Department receives a complaint of suspected life-threatening noncompliance with this part in connection with health care for a handicapped infant in a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, HHS will immediately conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter by initiating telephone contact with the recipient hospital to obtain information relating to the condition and treatment of the infant who is the subject of the complaint. The preliminary inquiry, which may include additional contact with the complainant and a requirement that pertinent records be provided to the Department, will generally be completed within 24 hours (or sooner if indicated) after receipt of the complaint.<PRTPAGE P="502"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Unless impracticable, whenever a recipient hospital has an Infant Care Review Committee, established and operated substantially in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 84.55(f), the Department will, as part of its preliminary inquiry, solicit the information available to, and the analysis and recommendations of, the ICRC. Unless, in the judgment of the responsible Department official, other action is necessary to protect the life or health of a handicapped infant, prior to initiating an on-site investigation, the Department will await receipt of this information from the ICRC for 24 hours (or less if indicated) after receipt of the complaint. The Department may require a subsequent written report of the ICRC's findings, accompanied by pertinent records and documentation.</P>
              <P>(3) On the basis of the information obtained during preliminary inquiry, including information provided by the hospital (including the hospital's ICRC, if any), information provided by the complainant, and all other information obtained, the Department will determine whether there is a need for an on-site investigation of the complaint. Whenever the Department determines that doubt remains that the recipient hospital or some other recipient is in compliance with this part or additional documentation is desired to substantiate a conclusion, the Department will initiate an on-site investigation or take some other appropriate action. Unless impracticable, prior to initiating an on-site investigation, the Department's medical consultant (referred to in paragraph 6) will contact the hospital's ICRC or appropriate medical personnel of the recipient hospital.</P>
              <P>(4) In conducting on-site investigations, when a recipient hospital has an ICRC established and operated substantially in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 84.55(f), the investigation will begin with, or include at the earliest practicable time, a meeting with the ICRC or its designees. In all on-site investigations, the Department will make every effort to minimize any potential inconvenience or disruption, accommodate the schedules of health care professionals and avoid making medical records unavailable. The Department will also seek to coordinate its investigation with any related investigations by the state child protective services agency so as to minimize potential disruption.</P>
              <P>(5) It is the policy of the Department to make no comment to the public or media regarding the substance of a pending preliminary inquiry or investigation.</P>
              <P>(6) The Department will obtain the assistance of a qualified medical consultant to evaluate the medical information (including medical records) obtained in the course of a preliminary inquiry or investigation. The name, title and telephone number of the Department's medical consultant will be made available to the recipient hospital. The Department's medical consultant will, if appropriate, contact medical personnel of the recipient hospital in connection with the preliminary inquiry, investigation or medical consultant's evaluation. To the extent practicable, the medical consultant will be a specialist with respect to the condition of the infant who is the subject of the preliminary inquiry or investigation. The medical consultant may be an employee of the Department or another person who has agreed to serve, with or without compensation, in that capacity.</P>
              <P>(7) The Department will advise the recipient hospital of its conclusions as soon as possible following the completion of a preliminary inquiry or investigation. Whenever final administrative findings following an investigation of a complaint of suspected life-threatening noncompliance cannot be made promptly, the Department will seek to notify the recipient and the complainant of the Department's decision on whether the matter will be immediately referred to the Department of Justice pursuant to 45 CFR 80.8.</P>
              <P>(8) Except as necessary to determine or effect compliance, the Department will (i) in conducting preliminary inquiries and investigations, permit information provided by the recipient hospital to the Department to be furnished without names or other identifying information relating to the infant and the infant's family; and (ii) to the extent permitted by law, safeguard the confidentiality of information obtained.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or</P>
            <P>(2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 85.42(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity in question, and must be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> (1) The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it.<PRTPAGE P="507"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section within 60 days of the effective date of this part except where structural changes in facilities are undertaken; such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but, in any event, as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities must be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, and it is not expected that such changes can be completed within six months, the agency shall develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
            <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
            <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>

            <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>

The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>

            <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a <PRTPAGE P="508"/>program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 85.51 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity in question and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

              <P>Under this section, a federally conducted program or activity is, in simple terms, anything a Federal agency does. Aside from employment, there are two major categories of federally conducted programs or activities covered by this regulation: those involving general public contact as part of ongoing agency operations, and those directly administered by the agency for program beneficiaries and participants. Activities in the first category include communication with the public (telephone contacts, office walk-ins, or interviews) and the public's use of the agency's facilities. Activities in the second <PRTPAGE P="510"/>category include programs that provide Federal services or benefits. This regulation does not, however, apply to programs or activities conducted outside the United States that do not involve individuals with handicaps in the United States.</P>
              <P>The <E T="03">major</E> programs subject to this regulation are listed below. Each of the components listed above occupies facilities which the public may have occasion to visit, engages in written and oral communication with the public, and hires Federal employees. In addition, some components operate programs which involve extensive public use, as summarized below:

              <P>One commenter urged the inclusion of a program operated by one component of the Office of the Secretary, and for a list of all programs and activities to be appended to the regulation. In light of the fact that all programs and activities are covered, that a comprehensive list of all programs would be very lengthy, and that such a list would have to be amended frequently as new programs are enacted and existing programs expire, the above list appears to be sufficient.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 85.3 Definitions.</HD>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Agency.</E> For purposes of this part <E T="03">agency</E> means the Department of Health and Human Services or any component part of the Department of Health and Human Services that conducts a program or activity covered by this part. <E T="03">Component agency</E> means any such component part.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Assistant Attorney General. Assistant Attorney General</E> refers to the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, United States Department of Justice.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Auxiliary aids. Auxiliary aids</E> means services or devices that enable persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, the agency's programs or activities. The definition provides examples of commonly used auxiliary aids. Although auxiliary aids are required explicitly only by § 85.51(a)(1), they may also be necessary to meet other requirements of this regulation.</P>
              <P>Two commenters suggested expanding the definition of <E T="03">auxiliary aids</E> and one of them further suggested re-naming <E T="03">auxiliary aids</E> to read <E T="03">aids for reasonable accommodation</E> and specifically include the services of attendants.</P>
              <P>The items set out in § 85.3 are clearly described as examples, and are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list. By giving examples rather than by including a list, other aids can be used, and, in appropriate cases, required, without amending the regulation. In certain instances, the services of attendants may indeed be appropriate; in those instances, they will fall under the definition in § 85.3. Therefore, there is no need to change the text of the regulations.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Complete complaint. Complete complaint</E> is defined to include all of the information necessary to enable the agency to investigate the complaint. The definition is necessary, because the 180 day period for the agency's investigation (<E T="03">see</E> § 85.61(g)) begins when the agency receives a complete complaint.</P>

              <P>Two commenters stated their belief that the definition of <E T="03">complete complaint</E> is too restrictive, and urged language which would give the complainant specific information as to what additional information is needed, and a further 30 days to submit such information, failing which the complaint would be dismissed without prejudice, and the complainant would be so informed.</P>
              <P>Procedures similar to this suggestion are currently in place, and complainants will be given reasonable opportunities to complete the information submitted. There appears to be no need to spell these procedures out in the regulation.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Facility.</E> The definition of <E T="03">facility</E> is similar to that in the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28 CFR 41.3(f)), except that the term <E T="03">rolling stock or other conveyances</E> has been added and the phrase <E T="03">or interest in such property</E> has been deleted because the term <E T="03">facility,</E> as used in this part, refers to structures and not to intangible property rights. It should, however, be noted that this part applies to all programs and activities conducted by the agency regardless of whether the facility in which they are conducted is owned, leased, <PRTPAGE P="511"/>or used on some other basis by the agency. The term <E T="03">facility</E> is used in §§ 85.41, 85.42, and 85.61(f).</P>
              <P>One commenter proposed not to delete the phrase <E T="03">or interest in such property.</E> As previously stated, the phrase <E T="03">or interest in such property</E> has been deleted because the term <E T="03">facility,</E> as used in this part, refers to structures and not to intangible property rights.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Individual with Handicaps.</E> The definition of <E T="03">individual with handicaps</E> is identical to the definition of <E T="03">handicapped person</E> appearing in the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28 CFR 41.31), and the HHS regulation for federally assisted programs (45 CFR 84.3(j)). Although section 103(d) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 changed the statutory term <E T="03">handicapped individual</E> to <E T="03">individual with handicaps,</E> the legislative history of the amendment indicates that no substantive change was intended. Thus, although the term has been changed in this regulation to be consistent with the statute as amended, the definition is unchanged. In particular, although the term as revised refers to <E T="03">handicaps</E> in the plural, it does not exclude persons who have only one handicap.</P>
              <P>One commenter suggested that we add <E T="03">sensory</E> to the phrase <E T="03">physical or mental impairment.</E> Since the definition set out in § 85.3 specifically includes the sense organs among the body systems whose impairment constitutes a handicap, we have not found it necessary to amend the regulation.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">OCR. OCR</E> means the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">OCR Director/Special Assistant</E> means the Director of the Office for Civil Rights, who serves concurrently as the Special Assistant to the Secretary for Civil Rights, or a designee of the OCR Director/Special Assistant.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Qualified individual with handicaps.</E> The definition of <E T="03">qualified individual with handicaps</E> is a revised version of the definition of <E T="03">qualified handicapped person</E> appearing in the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28 CFR 41.32) and the HHS section 504 regulation for federally assisted programs (45 CFR 84.3(k)).</P>

              <P>Paragraph (1) is an adaptation of existing definitions of <E T="03">qualified handicapped person</E> for purposes of federally assisted preschool, elementary, and secondary education programs (<E T="03">see, e.g.,</E> 45 CFR 84.3(k)(2)). It provides that an individual with handicaps is qualified for preschool, elementary, or secondary education programs conducted by the agency, if he or she is a member of a class of persons otherwise entitled by statute, regulation, or agency policy to receive these services from the agency. In other words, an individual with handicaps is qualified if, considering all factors other than the handicapping condition, he or she is entitled to receive educational services from the agency.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (2) deviates from existing regulations for federally assisted programs because of intervening court decisions. It defines <E T="03">qualified individual with handicaps</E> with regard to any program other than those covered by paragraph (1) under which a person is required to perform services or to achieve a level of accomplishment. In such programs, a qualified individual with handicaps is one who can achieve the purpose of the program without modifications in the program that the agency can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in its nature. This definition reflects the decision of the Supreme Court in <E T="03">Davis.</E>
              </P>

              <P>In that case, the Court ruled that a hearing-impaired applicant to a nursing school was not a <E T="03">qualified handicapped person</E> because her hearing impairment would prevent her from participating in the clinical training portion of the program. The Court found that, if the program were modified so as to enable the respondent to participate (by exempting her from the clinical training requirements), <E T="03">she would not receive even a rough equivalent of the training a nursing program normally gives. Id.</E> at 410. It also found that <E T="03">the purpose of [the] program was to train persons who could serve the nursing profession in all customary ways, Id.</E> at 413, and that the respondent would be unable, because of her hearing impairment, to perform some functions expected of a registered nurse. It, therefore, concluded that the school was not required by section 504 to make such modifications that would result in <E T="03">a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program. Id.</E> at 410.</P>

              <P>We have incorporated the Court's language in the definition of <E T="03">qualified individual with handicaps</E> in order to make clear that such a person must be able to participate in the program offered by the agency. The agency is required to make modifications in order to enable an applicant with handicaps to participate, but is not required to offer a program of a fundamentally different nature. The test is whether, with appropriate modifications, the applicant can achieve the purpose of the program offered, not whether the applicant could benefit or obtain results from some other program that the agency does not offer. Although the revised definition allows exclusion of some individuals with handicaps from some programs, it requires that an individual with handicaps who is capable of achieving the purpose of the program must be accommodated, provided that the modifications do not fundamentally alter the purpose of the program.</P>

              <P>One commenter proposed inserting the second sentence from the above paragraph into the regulatory text. We believe that the use of this language in the preamble is sufficient.<PRTPAGE P="512"/>
              </P>

              <P>Another commenter commended HHS for the discussion of <E T="03">Davis,</E> and the cases interpreting the <E T="03">Davis</E> decision, in order to explain why the language of this part does not precisely track that of the regulations concerning federally assisted recipients (45 CFR part 84). Two other commenters stated their view that incorporating <E T="03">Davis</E> and <E T="03">Alexander</E> into the regulation was unduly restrictive, and that the differences between this part and part 84 would result in holding HHS to a lesser standard than HHS holds recipients of Federal financial assistance.</P>
              <P>We believe that the Supreme Court's decision in <E T="03">Davis</E> as well as the subsequent lower court decisions following <E T="03">Davis</E> interpret section 504 and that it is necessary to reflect those decisions in the Department's regulation. The suggested changes are therefore not being adopted.</P>
              <P>The agency has the burden of demonstrating that a proposed modification would constitute a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity. Furthermore, in demonstrating that a modification would result in such an alteration, the agency must follow the procedures established in §§ 85.42(a) and 85.51(d), which are discussed below, for demonstrating that an action would result in undue financial and administrative burdens to the agency. That is, the decision must be made by the agency head or his or her designee in writing after consideration of all resources which are legally available to the agency for the purpose, and must be accompanied by an explanation of the reasons for the decision. If the agency head determines that an action would result in a fundamental alteration, the agency must consider options that would enable the individual with handicaps to achieve the purpose of the program but would not result in such an alteration.</P>

              <P>Two commenters suggested that the total resources of the agency be considered in determining <E T="03">undue burden.</E> Because many Department funds are earmarked for specific purposes and are therefore unavailable for use elsewhere, the entire agency budget is not an appropriate consideration.</P>

              <P>For programs or activities which do not fall under either of the first two paragraphs, paragraph (3) adopts the existing definition of <E T="03">qualified handicapped person</E> with respect to services (28 CFR 41.32(b)) in the coordination regulation for programs receiving Federal financial assistance. Under this definition, a qualified individual with handicaps is an individual with handicaps who meets the essential eligibility requirements for participation in the program or activity.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (4) explains that <E T="03">qualified individual with handicaps</E> means <E T="03">qualified handicapped person</E> as that term is defined for purposes of employment in the EEOC regulation at 29 CFR 1613.702(f), which is made applicable to this part by § 85.31. Nothing in this part changes existing regulations pertaining to employment.</P>

              <P>One commenter proposed using the general section 504 definition of <E T="03">qualified handicapped person</E> in employment cases rather than the definition of the EEOC regulation. The definition has been supplied by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which coordinates all employment discrimination matters throughout the government. It is also the Department's view that it is important to have a uniform definition of what constitutes employment discrimination throughout the Federal government.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Secretary</E> means the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Secretary's designee.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Section 504.</E> This definition makes clear that, as used in this part, <E T="03">section 504</E> applies only to programs or activities conducted by the agency itself and not to programs or activities to which it provides Federal financial assistance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 85.11 Self-evaluation.</HD>
              <P>The agency shall conduct a self-evaluation of its compliance with section 504 within one year of the effective date of this regulation. The self-evaluation requirement is present in the existing section 504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.5(b)(2)) and the HHS regulations for federally assisted programs (45 CFR 84.6(k)). Experience has demonstrated the self-evaluation process to be a valuable means of establishing a working relationship with individuals with handicaps that promotes both effective and efficient implementation of section 504.</P>
              <P>One commenter stated that a three-year retention period is insufficient, and proposed that self-evaluations be kept indefinitely. The regulation requires the self-evaluation to be kept for a minimum of three years, but does not include a maximum. It is expected that the self-evaluation will be retained for the period provided in current document retention policies.</P>
              <P>Another commenter proposed that copies of the self-evaluation be made available for copying as well as for public inspection. This proposal has been adopted.</P>
              <P>A further commenter proposed the inclusion of provisions for assurances, transition plans and specific modification requirements. We believe that while assurances are appropriate—and can be specifically enforced—in section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs or activities, all of the entities involved in this part are under the control of the Secretary, who can issue the necessary directives; assurances are therefore not required.</P>

              <P>The final rule provides for participation in the self-evaluation process by individuals with handicaps or organizations representing <PRTPAGE P="513"/>individuals with handicaps by submitting comments, which may include the development of transition plans. It is expected that component agencies will consult with individuals with handicaps among their own staff in the course of preparing self-evaluations.</P>
              <P>Because modification requirements are intended to address any potential problems in the agency's programs or activities, they are not specified in the regulation.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 85.12 Notice.</HD>
              <P>Section 85.12 requires the agency to disseminate sufficient information to employees, applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons to apprise them of the rights and protections afforded by section 504 and this part. Methods of providing this information include, for example, the publication of information in handbooks, manuals, and pamphlets that are distributed to the public to describe the agency's programs and activities or in connection with recruitment; the display of informative posters in service centers and other public places; or the broadcasting of information by television or radio.</P>
              <P>One commenter suggested the inclusion of a reference to recruitment materials in the above examples. Such a reference has been included.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 85.21 General prohibitions against discrimination.</HD>
              <P>Section 85.21 is an adaptation of the corresponding section of the section 504 coordination regulation for programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.51).</P>
              <P>Paragraph (a) restates the nondiscrimination mandate of section 504. The remaining paragraphs in § 85.21 establish the general principles for analyzing whether any particular action of the agency violates this mandate. These principles serve as the analytical foundation for the remaining sections of the part. If the agency violates a provision in any of the subsequent sections, it will also violate one of the general prohibitions found in § 85.21. When there is no applicable subsequent provision, the general prohibitions stated in this section apply.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (b) prohibits overt denials of equal treatment of individuals with handicaps. The agency may not refuse to provide an individual with handicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from its program simply because the person is handicapped. Such blatantly exclusionary practices could result from the use of irrebuttable presumptions that absolutely exclude certain classes of disabled persons (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> epileptics, hearing-impaired persons, persons with heart ailments) from participation in programs or activities without regard to an individual's actual ability to participate. Use of an irrebuttable presumption is permissible only when in all cases a physical condition by its very nature would prevent an individual from meeting the essential eligibility requirements for participation in the activity in question. It would be permissible, therefore, to exclude without an individual evaluation all persons who are blind in both eyes from eligibility for a license to operate a commercial vehicle in interstate commerce; but it may not be permissible to automatically disqualify all those who are blind in just one eye.</P>
              <P>In addition, section 504 prohibits more than just the most obvious denials of equal treatment. It is not enough to admit persons in wheelchairs to a program if the facilities in which the program is conducted are inaccessible. Paragraph (b)(1)(iii), therefore, requires that the opportunity to participate or benefit afforded to an individual with handicaps be as effective as that afforded to others. The later sections on program accessibility (§§ 85.41-43) and communication (§ 85.51) are specific applications of this principle.</P>
              <P>Despite the mandate of paragraph (d) that the agency administer its programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with handicaps, paragraph (b)(1)(iv), in conjunction with paragraph (d), permits the agency to develop separate or different aids, benefits, or services when necessary to provide individuals with handicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from the agency's programs or activities. Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) requires that different or separate aids, benefits, or services be provided only when necessary to ensure that the aids, benefits, or services are as effective as those provided to others. Even when separate or different aids, benefits or services would be more effective, paragraph (b)(2) provides that a qualified individual with handicaps still has the right to choose to participate in the program that is not designed to accommodate individuals with handicaps.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b)(1)(v) prohibits the agency from denying a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning or advisory board.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) prohibits the agency from limiting a qualified individual with handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving any aid, benefit, or service.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (b)(3) prohibits the agency from utilizing criteria or methods of administration that deny individuals with handicaps access to the agency's programs or activities. The phrase <E T="03">criteria or methods of administration</E> refers to official written agency policies, as well as the actual practices of the <PRTPAGE P="514"/>agency. This paragraph prohibits both blatantly exclusionary policies or practices and nonessential policies and practices that are neutral on their face, but deny individuals with handicaps an effective opportunity to participate.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b)(4) specifically applies the prohibition enunciated in § 85.21(b)(3) to the process of selecting sites for construction of new facilities or existing facilities to be used by the agency. Paragraph (b)(4) does not apply to construction of additional buildings at an existing site.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b)(5) prohibits the agency, in the selection of procurement contractors, from using criteria that subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (b)(6) prohibits the agency from discriminating against qualified individuals with handicaps on the basis of handicap in the granting of licenses or certifications. A person is a <E T="03">qualified individual with handicaps</E> with respect to licensing or certification if he or she can meet the essential eligibility requirements for receiving the license or certification (<E T="03">see</E> § 85.3).</P>
              <P>In addition, the agency may not establish requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap. For example, the agency must comply with this requirement when establishing safety standards for the operations of licensees. In that case, the agency must ensure that the standards it promulgates do not discriminate against the employment of qualified individuals with handicaps in an impermissible manner.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b)(6) does not extend section 504 directly to the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities themselves. The programs or activities of Federal licensees or certified entities are not themselves federally conducted programs or activities; nor are they programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance merely by virtue of the Federal license or certificate. However, as noted above, section 504 may affect the content of the rules established by the agency for the operation of the program or activity of the licensee or certified entity and thereby indirectly affect limited aspects of their operations.</P>
              <P>One commenter suggested pointing out that Federal licensees or certified entities, having received services from Federal employees during the process of licensing or certification, thereby become Federally assisted recipients, and are covered by 45 CFR part 84. Such an argument is beyond the scope of this part, and is therefore not being included.</P>
              <P>Another commenter suggested including language such as that found in 45 CFR 84.4(b)(1) to the effect that agencies may not perpetuate discrimination against qualified individuals with handicaps by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap. Assistance from the agency that would provide significant support to an organization constitutes Federal financial assistance and the organization, as a recipient of such assistance, would be covered by the section 504 regulation for federally assisted programs.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (c) provides that programs conducted pursuant to Federal statute or Executive order that are designed to benefit only individuals with handicaps or a given class of individuals with handicaps may be limited to individuals those with handicaps.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (d) provides that the agency must administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the next of qualified individuals with handicaps, <E T="03">i.e.</E> in a setting that enables individuals with handicaps to interact with nonhandicapped individuals to the fullest extent possible.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 85.31 Employment.</HD>

              <P>Section 85.31 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in employment by the agency. Courts have held that section 504, as amended in 1978, covers the employment practices of Executive agencies. <E T="03">Gardner</E> v. <E T="03">Morris,</E> 752 F.2d 1271, 1277 (8th Cir. 1985); <E T="03">Smith</E> v. <E T="03">United States Postal Service,</E> 742 F.2d 257, 259-60 (6th Cir. 1984); <E T="03">Prewitt</E> v. <E T="03">United States Postal Service,</E> 662 F.2d 292, 302-04 (5th Cir. 1981). <E T="03">Contra McGuiness</E> v. <E T="03">United States Postal Service,</E> 744 F.2d 1318, 1320-21 (7th Cir. 1984); <E T="03">Boyd</E> v. <E T="03">United States Postal Service,</E> 752 F.2d 410, 413-14 (9th Cir. 1985).</P>

              <P>Courts uniformly have held that, in order to give effect to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, which covers Federal employment, the administrative procedures of section 501 must be followed in processing complaints of employment discrimination under section 504. <E T="03">Morgan</E> v. <E T="03">United States Postal Service,</E> 798 F.2d 1162, 1164-65 (8th Cir. 1986); <E T="03">Smith,</E> 742 F.2d at 262; <E T="03">Prewitt,</E> 662 F.2d at 304. Accordingly, § 85.31 (Employment) of this rule adopts the definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 as established in regulations of the EEOC at 29 CFR part 1613. Responsibility for coordinating enforcement of Federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment is assigned to the EEOC by Executive Order 12067 (3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 206). Under this authority, the EEOC establishes government-wide standards on nondiscrimination in employment on the basis of handicap.</P>

              <P>One commenter proposed that the general definition of <E T="03">qualified individual with handicaps</E> be used in this section, instead of that used under section 501. We believe that the above paragraphs sufficiently explain the need for using the section 501 definition.<PRTPAGE P="515"/>
              </P>
              <P>In addition to this section, § 85.61(c) specifies that the agency will use the existing EEOC procedures to resolve allegations of employment discrimination.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 85.41 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.</HD>
              <P>Section 85.41 states the general nondiscrimination principle underlying the program accessibility requirements of §§ 85.42 and 85.43.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 85.42 Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</HD>
              <P>This part adopts the program accessibility concept found in the existing section 504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.57) with certain modifications. Thus, § 85.42 requires that each agency program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The part also makes clear that the agency is not required to make each of its existing facilities accessible (§ 85.42(a)(1)). However, § 85.42, unlike 28 CFR 41.57, places explicit limits on the agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility (§ 85.42(a)(2)).</P>

              <P>One commenter stated that the provisions of § 85.42(a)(1) were negatively worded and may reflect a misinterpretation of the decision of the Supreme Court in <E T="03">Grove City College</E> v. <E T="03">Bell,</E> 465 U.S. 555 (1984), and argued for deletion of this language.</P>
              <P>The language is identical to that in the section 504 regulation for federally assisted programs or activities. We believe that the inclusion of this language is necessary in order to make clear that, while every aspect of every Federal program or activity need not be accessible, each program or activity, when viewed as a whole, must be accessible.</P>
              <P>Another commenter recommended adding the language “where other methods are equally effective in achieving compliance from § 84.42(b) to § 84.42(a)(1). We believe that, because § 84.42 (a) and (b) treat different aspects of the subject, their language must necessarily differ.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (a)(2) generally codifies recent case law that defines the scope of the agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility. This paragraph provides that in meeting the program accessibility requirement, the agency is not required to take any action that would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity, or in undue financial and administrative burdens. A similar limitation is provided in § 85.51(d). This provision is based on the Supreme Court's holding in <E T="03">Southeastern Community College</E> v. <E T="03">Davis,</E> 442 U.S. 397 (1979), that section 504 does not require program modifications that result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program, and on the Court's statement that section 504 does not require modifications that would result in “undue financial and administrative burdens.” 442 U.S. at 412. Since <E T="03">Davis,</E> circuit courts have applied this limitation on a showing that only one of the two “undue burdens” would be created as a result of the modification sought to be imposed under section 504. <E T="03">See, e.g., Dopico</E> v. <E T="03">Goldschmidt,</E> 687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); <E T="03">American Public Transit Association</E> v. <E T="03">Lewis,</E> 655 F.2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981).</P>

              <P>Paragraph (a)(2) and § 85.51(d) are also supported by the Supreme Court's decision in <E T="03">Alexander</E> v. <E T="03">Choate,</E> 469 U.S. 287 (1985). <E T="03">Alexander</E> involved a challenge to the State of Tennessee's reduction of inpatient hospital care coverage under Medicaid from 20 to 14 days per year. Plaintiffs argued that this reduction violated section 504 because it had an adverse impact on handicapped persons. The Court assumed without deciding that section 504 reaches at least some conduct that has an unjustifiable disparate impact on handicapped people, but held that the reduction was not “the sort of disparate impact” discrimination that might be prohibited by section 504 or its implementing regulation. <E T="03">Id</E> at 299.</P>
              <P>Relying on <E T="03">Davis,</E> the Court said that section 504 guarantees qualified handicapped persons “meaningful access to the benefits the grantee offers,” <E T="03">id.</E> at 301, and that “<E T="03">reasonable adjustments</E> in the nature of the benefit offered must at times be made to assure meaningful access.” <E T="03">Id.</E> n.21 (emphasis added). However, section 504 does not require “ ‘changes,’ ‘adjustments,’ or ‘modifications’ to existing programs that would be ‘substantial’ * * * or that would constitute ‘fundamental alteration[s] in the nature of a program.’ ” <E T="03">Id.</E> at n.20 (citations omitted). <E T="03">Alexander</E> supports the position, based on <E T="03">Davis</E> and the earlier lower court decisions, that in some situations, certain accommodations for a handicapped person may so alter an agency's program or activity, or entail such extensive costs and administrative burdens that the refusal to undertake the accommodations is not discriminatory. Thus, failure to include such an “undue burdens” provision could lead to judicial invalidation of the regulation or reversal of a particular enforcement action taken pursuant to the regulation.</P>

              <P>This paragraph, however, does not establish an absolute defense; it does not relieve the agency of all obligations to individuals with handicaps. Although the agency is not required to take actions that would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens, it nevertheless must take any other steps necessary to ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the federally conducted program or activity.<PRTPAGE P="516"/>
              </P>
              <P>It is our view that compliance with § 85.42(a) would in most cases not result in undue financial and administrative burdens on the agency. In determining whether financial and administrative burdens are undue, all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity should be considered. The burden of proving that compliance with § 85.42(a) would fundamentally alter the nature of a program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens rests with the agency. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. Any person who believes that he or she or any specific class of persons has been injured by the agency head's decision or failure to make a decision may file a complaint under the compliance procedures established in § 85.61. The opportunity to file such a complaint responds to one commenter's suggestion that review by a high level Department official be assured.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b)(1) sets forth a number of means by which program accessibility may be achieved, including redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, and provision of aides. In choosing among methods, the agency shall give priority consideration to those that will be consistent with provision of services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of individuals with handicaps. Structural changes in existing facilities are required only when there is no other feasible way to make the agency's program accessible. (It should be noted that “structural changes” include all physical changes to a facility; the term does not refer only to changes to structural features, such as removal of or alteration to a load-bearing structural member.) The agency may comply with the program accessibility requirement by delivering services at alternate accessible sites or making home visits as appropriate.</P>
              <P>One commenter proposed that methods other than structural changes to ensure accessibility should be “equally effective”. The regulations implementing section 504 for federally assisted programs do not contain such language. The addition of the proposed language would impose a regulatory standard on the Department not required of recipients. In view of the fact that the 1978 amendments were intended to apply the same requirements to federally conducted programs as apply to federally assisted programs, the proposed language is not being adopted.</P>
              <P>Paragraphs (c) and (d) establish time periods for complying with the program accessibility requirement. As currently required for federally assisted programs by 28 CFR 41.57(b), the agency must make any necessary structural changes in facilities as soon as practicable, but in no event later than three (3) years after the effective date of this part. Where structural modifications are required and it is not expected that these can be completed within six months, a transition plan should be developed within six months of the effective date of this part. Aside from structural changes, all other necessary steps to achieve compliance shall be taken within sixty days.</P>
              <P>One commenter proposes to limit the time allowed for making structural modifications to one year. We note that the basic requirement is that these changes be made “as soon as practicable,” and that the three-year limit is the maximum period of time. Furthermore, the three-year maximum for transition plans is identical to that contained in the regulations for federally assisted recipients.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 85.43 Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.</HD>
              <P>Overlapping coverage exists with respect to new construction and alterations under section 504 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). Section 85.43 provides that those buildings that are constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps in accordance with 41 CFR part 101-19, 101-19.600 to 101-19.607 (GSA regulation which incorporates the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards). This standard was promulgated pursuant to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). We believe that it is appropriate to adopt the existing Architectural Barriers Act standard for section 504 compliance because new and altered buildings subject to this regulation are also subject to the Architectural Barriers Act and because adoption of the standard will avoid duplicative and possibly inconsistent standards.</P>
              <P>Existing buildings leased by the agency after the effective date of this regulation are not required by the regulation to meet accessibility standards simply by virtue of being leased. They are subject, however, to the program accessibility standards for existing facilities in § 85.42. To the extent the buildings are newly constructed or altered, they must also meet the new constructions and alteration requirements of § 85.43.</P>

              <P>Federal practice under section 504 has always treated newly leased buildings as subject to the existing facility program accessibility standard. Unlike the construction of new buildings where architectural barriers can be avoided at little or no cost, the application of new construction standards to an existing building being leased raises the same prospect of retrofitting buildings as the use of an existing Federal facility, and the <PRTPAGE P="517"/>agency believes that same program accessibility standards should apply to both owned and leased existing buildings.</P>
              <P>In <E T="03">Rose</E> v. <E T="03">United States Postal Service,</E> 774 F.2d 1355 (9th Cir. 1985), the Ninth Circuit held that the Architectural Barriers Act requires accessibility at the time of lease. The <E T="03">Rose</E> court did not address the question of whether section 504 likewise requires accessibility as a condition of lease, and the case was remanded to the District Court for, among other things, consideration of this issue. Two commenters urged that leased buildings be required to be accessible at the time of lease. The agency may provide more specific guidance on section 504 requirements for leased buildings after the litigation is completed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 85.51 Communications.</HD>

              <P>Section 85.51 requires the agency to take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with personnel of other Federal entities, applicants, participants, and members of the public. These steps shall include procedures for determining when auxiliary aids are necessary under § 85.1(a)(1) to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, the agency's program or activity. They shall also include an opportunity for individuals with handicaps to request the auxiliary aids of their choice. This expressed choice shall be given primary consideration by the agency (§ 85.51(a)(1)(i)). The agency shall honor the choice unless it can demonstrate that another effective means of communication exists or that use of the means chosen would not be required under § 85.51(d). That paragraph limits the obligations of the agency to ensure effective communication in accordance with <E T="03">Davis</E> and the circuit court opinions interpreting it (<E T="03">see supra</E> preamble discussion of § 85.42(c)(2)). Unless not required by § 85.51(d), the agency shall provide auxiliary aids at no cost to the individual with handicaps.</P>
              <P>One commenter proposed that the choice of auxiliary aid made by the individual with handicaps should govern unless it would constitute an undue hardship on the agency. We believe that the language set out above is adequate to ensure consideration of an individual's preference.</P>
              <P>Another commenter proposed that the regulation require all films and videotapes produced by the agency to be captioned for the hearing-impaired. The Department intends to examine all appropriate methods of ensuring effective communication.</P>
              <P>The same commenter applauded HHS for the inclusion of the language requiring HHS to inform individuals with handicaps of their section 504 rights.</P>
              <P>The discussion of § 85.42(a), Program accessibility, Existing facilities, regarding the determination of what constitutes undue financial and administrative burdens, also applies to § 85.51(d) and should be referred to for a complete understanding of the agency's obligation to comply with § 85.51.</P>

              <P>In some circumstances, a notepad and written materials may be sufficient to permit effective communication with a hearing-impaired person. In many circumstances, however, they may not be, particularly when the information being communicated is complex or exchanged for a lengthy period of time (<E T="03">e.g.</E> a meeting) or where the hearing-impaired applicant or participant is not skilled in spoken or written language. In these cases, a sign language interpreter may be appropriate.</P>
              <P>One commenter proposed changing the language to state that notepads rarely suffice for communication with the hearing-impaired. Considering that a significant number of the hearing-impaired may not be skilled in sign language, we believe that the language used is appropriate.</P>
              <P>For vision-impaired persons, effective communication might be achieved by several means, including readers and audio recordings. In general, the agency intends to inform the public of (1) the communications services it offers to afford individuals with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from its programs and activities, (2) the opportunity to request a particular mode of communication, and (3) the agency's preferences regarding auxiliary aids if it can demonstrate that several different modes are effective.</P>
              <P>The agency shall ensure effective communication with vision-impaired and hearing-impaired persons involved in proceedings conducted by the agency. Auxiliary aids must be afforded where necessary to ensure effective communication at the proceedings. If sign language interpreters are necessary, the agency may require that it be given reasonable notice prior to the proceedings of the need for an interpreter. Moreover, the agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature (§ 85.51(a)(1)(ii)). For example, the agency need not provide eye glasses or hearing aids to applicants or participants in its programs. Similarly, the regulation does not require the agency to provide wheelchairs to persons with mobility impairments.</P>
              <P>One commenter proposed that the items which agencies are not required to provide and the circumstances involved be described in more detail. We believe that the description given is sufficient, because the interpretation of this provision will be made on a case-by-case basis.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (b) requires the agency to ensure that individuals with handicaps can obtain information concerning accessible services, activities, and facilities.<PRTPAGE P="518"/>
              </P>
              <P>Paragraph (c) requires the agency to provide signage at inaccessible facilities that direct users to locations with information about accessible facilities.</P>
              <P>One commenter suggested specifically mentioning the international symbol for deafness, and placing such signs at the main entrance of buildings equipped to service the hearing-impaired. We believe that the language contained in § 85.51 (b) and (c) requires the agency to ensure that individuals with handicaps, including those with impaired hearing, can obtain information regarding accessibility, and that this requirement is sufficient to afford flexibility on the part of the agency regarding use of appropriate signage.</P>

              <P>One commenter proposed adding the words “in the most integrated setting appropriate” to the language in § 85.51(d). This language already appears elsewhere in the regulation, <E T="03">e.g.</E> in § 85.42(b)(2), and it is the Department's intention to act in accordance with that provision.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 85.61 Compliance procedures.</HD>
              <P>Paragraph (a) specifies that paragraphs (b) and (d) through (l) of this section establish the procedures for processing complaints other than employment complaints. Paragraph (c) provides that the agency will process employment complaints according to procedures established in existing regulations of the EEOC (29 CFR part 1613) pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b) designates the official responsible for coordinating implementation of § 85.61. The NPRM stated that responsibility for the implementation and operation of this “part” shall be vested in the OCR Director/Special Assistant. The final rule has been revised by replacing the word “part” with the word “section” to clarify the responsibility for coordinating implementation of § 85.61.</P>
              <P>The agency is required to accept and investigate all complete complaints (§ 85.61(d)). Two commenters suggested that a complainant have an opportunity to remedy an incomplete complaint. Current administrative procedures provide for this practice and it need not be included in the text of the regulation.</P>
              <P>If the agency determines that it does not have jurisdiction over a complaint, it shall promptly notify the complainant and make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate entity of the Federal Government (§ 85.61(e)). One commenter pointed out that where a reference to another entity of the Federal government is required, the obligation to refer should be absolute, not limited to reasonable efforts. The language “shall make reasonable efforts to refer” is not intended to minimize the Department's obligation.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (f) requires the agency to notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB) upon receipt of a complaint alleging that a building or facility subject to the Architectural Barriers Act was designed, constructed, or altered in a manner that does not provide ready access and use by individuals with handicaps.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (g) requires the agency to provide to the complainant, in writing, findings of fact and conclusions of law, the relief granted if noncompliance is found, and notice of the right to appeal (§ 85.61(g)). One appeal within the agency shall be provided (§ 85.61(i)). The appeal will not be heard by the same person who made the initial determination of compliance or noncompliance.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (1) permits the agency to delegate its authority for investigating complaints to other Federal agencies. However, the statutory obligation of the agency to make a final determination of compliance or noncompliance may not be delegated.</P>
              <P>Commenters have suggested the following:</P>
              <P>Notifying complainants whenever their complaints are referred to another agency. Current administrative procedures provide for this practice and it need not be included in the text of the regulation.</P>
              <P>Describing the basic parameters for submitting or obtaining evidence used to decide appeals. Since the grounds for appeal may be extremely varied, it would not be practicable to set out parameters for every appeal.</P>

              <P>Including a statement that all other regulations, forms and directives issued by HHS are superseded by the nondiscrimination requirements of this part. The Department views any other issuances falling short of the requirements of this regulation as insufficient to ensure compliance and therefore such a statement is unnecessary.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) These are the definitions for terms used in this part. Different definitions may be found in Federal statutes or regulations that apply more specifically to particular program or activities.</P>
            <P>(b) The terms <E T="03">direct Federal financial assistance, Federal financial assistance provided directly,</E>
              <E T="03">direct funding, and directly funded</E> mean that the government or a pass-through entity (under this part) selects the provider and either purchases services from that provider (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> via a contract) or awards funds to that provider to carry out a service (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> via grant or cooperative agreement). In general, Federal financial assistance shall be treated as direct, unless it meets the definition of “indirect Federal financial assistance” or “Federal financial assistance provided indirectly.”</P>
            <P>(c) The term <E T="03">indirect Federal financial assistance</E> or <E T="03">Federal financial assistance provided indirectly</E> means that the choice of the service provider is placed in the hands of the beneficiary, and the cost of that service is paid through a voucher, certificate, or other similar means of government-funded payment.</P>
            <P>(1) Federal financial assistance provided to an organization is considered indirect when:</P>

            <P>(i) The Government program through which the beneficiary receives the <PRTPAGE P="538"/>voucher, certificate, or other similar means of Government-funded payment is neutral toward religion;</P>
            <P>(ii) The organization receives the assistance as a result of a decision of the beneficiary, not a decision of the government; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The beneficiary has at least one adequate secular option for the use of the voucher, certificate, or other similar means of Government-funded payment.</P>
            <P>(2) The recipients of sub-grants that receive Federal financial assistance through State-administered programs are not considered recipients of “indirect Federal financial assistance” [or recipients of “Federal funds provided indirectly”] as those terms are used in this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Pass-through entity</E> means a non-Federal entity that provides a subaward to a subrecipient to carry out part of a Federal program.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Recipient</E> means a non-Federal entity that receives a Federal award directly from a Federal awarding agency to carry out an activity under a Federal program. The term recipient does not include subrecipients.</P>

            <P>This part applies to grants awarded in HHS social service programs governed by either the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements at 45 CFR part 75 or Block Grant regulations at 45 CFR part 96, except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Discretionary grants.</E> This part is not applicable to the discretionary grant programs that are governed Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Charitable Choice regulations found at 42 CFR part 54a. This part is also not applicable to discretionary grant programs that are governed by the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) Charitable Choice regulations at 45 CFR part 1050, with the exception of §§ 87.1 and 87.3(i) through (l) which do apply to such CSBG discretionary grants. Discretionary grants authorized by the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act are also not governed by this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Formula and block grants.</E> This part does not apply to non-discretionary and block grant programs governed by the SAMHSA Charitable Choice regulations found at 42 CFR part 54, or the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Charitable Choice regulations at 45 CFR part 260. Block grants governed by the CSBG Charitable Choice regulations at 45 CFR part 1050 are not subject to this part, with the exception that §§ 87.1 and 87.3(i) through (l) do apply to such CSBG block grants. This part is not applicable to Child Care and Development Block Grants governed by 45 CFR part 98.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 87.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Grants.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Faith-based or religious organizations are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to participate in any HHS awarding agency program for which they are otherwise eligible. Neither the HHS awarding agency, nor any State or local government and other pass-through entity receiving funds under any HHS awarding agency program shall, in the selection of service providers, discriminate for or against an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation. As used in this section, “program” refers to activities supported by discretionary, formula or block grants.</P>

            <P>(b) Organizations that apply for or receive direct financial assistance from an HHS awarding agency may not support or engage in any explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization), as part of the programs or services funded with direct financial assistance from the HHS awarding agency, or in any other manner prohibited by law. If an organization conducts such activities, the activities must be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or services funded with direct financial assistance from the HHS awarding agency, and participation must be voluntary for beneficiaries of the programs or services funded with such assistance. The use of indirect Federal financial assistance is not subject to this <PRTPAGE P="539"/>restriction. Nothing in this part restricts HHS's authority under applicable Federal law to fund activities, such as the provision of chaplaincy services, that can be directly funded by the Government consistent with the Establishment Clause.</P>
            <P>(c) A faith-based or religious organization that participates in HHS awarding agency-funded programs or services will retain its independence from Federal, State, and local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it does not use direct financial assistance from an HHS awarding agency (including through a prime or sub-award) to support or engage in any explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization). A faith-based or religious organization may use space in its facilities to provide programs or services funded with financial assistance from the HHS awarding agency without removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a faith-based or religious organization that receives financial assistance from the HHS awarding agency retains its authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its organization's mission statements and other governing documents in accordance with all program requirements, statutes, and other applicable requirements governing the conduct of HHS funded activities.</P>
            <P>(d) An organization that participates in any programs funded by financial assistance from an HHS awarding agency shall not, in providing services or in outreach activities related to such services, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice. However, an organization that participates in a program funded by indirect financial assistance need not modify its program activities to accommodate a beneficiary who chooses to expend the indirect aid on the organization's program.</P>
            <P>(e) No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by an HHS awarding agency or a State or local government in administering financial assistance from the HHS awarding agency shall require only faith-based or religious organizations to provide assurances that they will not use monies or property for explicitly religious activities. Any restrictions on the use of grant funds shall apply equally to religious and non-religious organizations. All organizations that participate in HHS awarding agency programs, including organizations with religious character or affiliations, must carry out eligible activities in accordance with all program requirements and other applicable requirements governing the conduct of HHS awarding agency-funded activities, including those prohibiting the use of direct financial assistance to engage in explicitly religious activities. No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by the HHS awarding agency or a State or local government in administering financial assistance from the HHS awarding agency shall disqualify faith-based or religious organizations from participating in the HHS awarding agency's programs because such organizations are motivated or influenced by religious faith to provide social services, or because of their religious character or affiliation.</P>

            <P>(f) A faith-based or religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, set forth in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1, is not forfeited when the faith-based or religious organization receives direct or indirect financial assistance from an HHS awarding agency. Some HHS awarding agency programs, however, contain independent statutory provisions requiring that all recipients agree not to discriminate in employment on the basis of religion. Accordingly, recipients should consult with the appropriate HHS awarding agency program <PRTPAGE P="540"/>office if they have questions about the scope of any applicable requirement.</P>
            <P>(g) In general, the HHS awarding agency does not require that a recipient, including a faith-based or religious organization, obtain tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code to be eligible for funding under HHS awarding agency programs. Many grant programs, however, do require an organization to be a “nonprofit organization” in order to be eligible for funding. Funding announcements and other grant application solicitations that require organizations to have nonprofit status will specifically so indicate in the eligibility section of the solicitation. In addition, any solicitation that requires an organization to maintain tax-exempt status will expressly state the statutory authority for requiring such status. Recipients should consult with the appropriate HHS awarding agency program office to determine the scope of any applicable requirements. In HHS awarding agency programs in which an applicant must show that it is a nonprofit organization, the applicant may do so by any of the following means:</P>
            <P>(1) Proof that the Internal Revenue Service currently recognizes the applicant as an organization to which contributions are tax deductible under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;</P>
            <P>(2) A statement from a State or other governmental taxing body or the State secretary of State certifying that:</P>
            <P>(i) The organization is a nonprofit organization operating within the State; and</P>
            <P>(ii) No part of its net earnings may benefit any private shareholder or individual;</P>
            <P>(3) A certified copy of the applicant's certificate of incorporation or similar document that clearly establishes the nonprofit status of the applicant; or</P>
            <P>(4) Any item described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section, if that item applies to a State or national parent organization, together with a statement by the State or parent organization that the applicant is a local nonprofit affiliate.</P>
            <P>(h) If a recipient contributes its own funds in excess of those funds required by a matching or grant agreement to supplement HHS awarding agency-supported activities, the recipient has the option to segregate those additional funds or commingle them with the Federal award funds. If the funds are commingled, the provisions of this section shall apply to all of the commingled funds in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the provisions apply to the Federal funds. With respect to the matching funds, the provisions of this section apply irrespective of whether such funds are commingled with Federal funds or segregated.</P>
            <P>(i)(1) Faith-based or religious organizations providing social services in the United States to beneficiaries under an HHS program that is supported by direct Federal financial assistance must give written notice to beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries of certain protections. This written notice must be given to beneficiaries prior to the time they enroll in the program or receive services from such programs. Notice must be given in a manner prescribed by the HHS awarding agency. This notice must state that:</P>
            <P>(i) The organization may not discriminate against beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice;</P>
            <P>(ii) The organization may not require beneficiaries to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities that are offered by the organization, and any participation by beneficiaries in such activities must be purely voluntary;</P>
            <P>(iii) The organization must separate in time or location any privately funded explicitly religious activities from activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance;</P>
            <P>(iv) If a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary objects to the religious character of the organization, the organization will undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary has no objection; however, the organization cannot guarantee that in every instance an alternative provider will be available; and</P>

            <P>(v) Beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries may report violations of these <PRTPAGE P="541"/>protections, including any denials of services or benefits that violate these regulations, by contacting or filing a written complaint with the HHS awarding entity.</P>
            <P>(2) When the nature of the service provided or exigent circumstances make it impracticable to provide such written notice in advance of the actual service, service providers must advise beneficiaries of their protections at the earliest available opportunity.</P>
            <P>(j) If a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary of a social service program supported by the HHS awarding agency objects to the religious character of an organization that provides services in the United States under the program, that organization must promptly undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary has no objection. A referral may be made to another faith-based or religious organization, if the beneficiary has no objection to that provider. But if the beneficiary requests a secular provider, and a secular provider is available, then a referral must be made to that provider. Except for services provided by telephone, internet, or similar means, the referral must be to an alternative provider that is in reasonable geographic proximity to the organization making the referral and that offers services that are similar in substance and quality to those offered by the organization. The alternative provider also must have the capacity to accept additional beneficiaries.</P>
            <P>(k) When the organization determines that it is unable to identify an alternative provider, the organization must promptly notify the prime recipient entity from which it has received funds. The prime recipient of Federal financial assistance must notify the HHS awarding agency when a sub-recipient is unable to identify an alternative provider. If the organization is successful in making a referral, it shall maintain a record of the referral.</P>
            <P>(l) Decisions about awards of Federal financial assistance must be free from political interference or even the appearance of such interference and must be made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of the religious affiliation, or lack thereof, of a recipient organization.</P>
            <P>(m) If a pass-through entity, acting under a contract, grant, or other agreement with the Federal Government or with a State or local government that is administering a program supported by Federal financial assistance, is given the authority under the contract, grant, or agreement to select non-governmental organizations to provide services funded by the Federal Government, the pass-through entity must ensure compliance with the provisions of this part and any implementing regulations or guidance by the sub-recipient. If the pass-through entity is a non-governmental organization, it retains all other rights of a non-governmental organization under the program's statutory and regulatory provisions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The purpose of this part is to provide for the implementation and enforcement of the Federal conscience and anti-discrimination laws listed in § 88.3. Such laws, for example, protect the rights of individuals, entities, and health care entities to refuse to perform, assist in the performance of, or undergo certain health care services or research activities to which they may object for religious, moral, ethical, or other reasons. Such laws also protect patients from being subjected to certain health care or services over their conscientious objection. Consistent with their objective to protect the conscience and associated anti-discrimination rights of individuals, entities, and health care entities, the statutory provisions and the regulatory provisions contained in this part are to be interpreted and implemented broadly to effectuate their protective purposes.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>For the purposes of this part:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Assist in the performance</E> means to take an action that has a specific, reasonable, and articulable connection to furthering a procedure or a part of a health service program or research activity undertaken by or with another person or entity. This may include counseling, referral, training, or otherwise making arrangements for the procedure or a part of a health service program or research activity, depending on whether aid is provided by such actions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Department</E> means the Department of Health and Human Services and any component thereof.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Discriminate</E> or <E T="03">discrimination</E> includes, as applicable to, and to the extent permitted by, the applicable statute:</P>
            <P>(1) To withhold, reduce, exclude from, terminate, restrict, or make unavailable or deny any grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, loan, license, certification, accreditation, employment, title, or other similar instrument, position, or status;</P>
            <P>(2) To withhold, reduce, exclude from, terminate, restrict, or make unavailable or deny any benefit or privilege or impose any penalty; or</P>
            <P>(3) To utilize any criterion, method of administration, or site selection, including the enactment, application, or enforcement of laws, regulations, policies, or procedures directly or through contractual or other arrangements, that subjects individuals or entities protected under this part to any adverse treatment with respect to individuals, entities, or conduct protected under this part on grounds prohibited under an applicable statute encompassed by this part.</P>
            <P>(4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (3) of this definition, an entity subject to any prohibition in this part shall not be regarded as having engaged in discrimination against a protected entity where the entity offers and the protected entity voluntarily accepts an effective accommodation for the exercise of such protected entity's protected conduct, religious beliefs, or moral convictions. In determining whether any entity has engaged in discriminatory action with respect to any complaint or compliance review under this part, OCR will take into account the degree to which an entity had implemented policies to provide effective accommodations for the exercise of protected conduct, religious beliefs, or moral convictions under this part and whether or not the entity took any adverse action against a protected entity on the basis of protected conduct, beliefs, or convictions before the provision of any accommodation.</P>

            <P>(5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (3) of this definition, an entity subject to any prohibition in this part may require a protected entity to inform it of objections to performing, referring for, participating in, or assisting in the performance of specific procedures, programs, research, counseling, or treatments, but only to the <PRTPAGE P="543"/>extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that the protected entity may be asked in good faith to perform, refer for, participate in, or assist in the performance of, any act or conduct just described. Such inquiry may only occur after the hiring of, contracting with, or awarding of a grant or benefit to a protected entity, and once per calendar year thereafter, unless supported by a persuasive justification.</P>
            <P>(6) The taking of steps by an entity subject to prohibitions in this part to use alternate staff or methods to provide or further any objected-to conduct identified in paragraph (5) of this definition would not, by itself, constitute discrimination or a prohibited referral, if such entity does not require any additional action by, or does not take any adverse action against, the objecting protected entity (including individuals or health care entities), and if such methods do not exclude protected entities from fields of practice on the basis of their protected objections. Entities subject to prohibitions in this part may also inform the public of the availability of alternate staff or methods to provide or further the objected-to conduct, but such entity may not do so in a manner that constitutes adverse or retaliatory action against an objecting entity.</P>
            <P>

            <P>(4) The sale or lease of, and the permission to use (on other than a casual or transient basis), Federal property or any interest in such property without consideration or at a nominal consideration, or at a consideration which is reduced for the purpose of assisting the recipient or in recognition of the public interest to be served by such sale or lease to the recipient; and</P>
            <P>(5) Any agreement or other contract between the Federal government and a recipient that has as one of its purposes the provision of a subsidy to the recipient.</P>

            <P>(1) For purposes of the Coats-Snowe Amendment (42 U.S.C. 238n) and the subsections of this part implementing that law (§ 88.3(b)), an individual physician or other health care professional, including a pharmacist; health care personnel; a participant in a program of training in the health professions; an applicant for training or study in the health professions; a post-graduate physician training program; a hospital; a medical laboratory; an entity engaging in biomedical or behavioral research; a pharmacy; or any other health care provider or health care facility.

Each recipient or sub-recipient shall permit access by OCR during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, as well as its facilities, as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Asserted considerations of privacy or confidentiality may not operate to bar OCR from evaluating or seeking to enforce compliance with this part.

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Reporting requirement.</E> If a recipient or sub-recipient is subject to a determination by OCR of noncompliance with this part, the recipient or sub-recipient must, in any application for new or renewed Federal financial assistance or Departmental funding in the three years following such determination, disclose the existence of the determination of noncompliance.

OCR shall coordinate handling of complaints with the relevant Department component(s). The complaint filer is not required to be the entity whose rights under the Federal conscience and anti-discrimination laws or this part have been potentially violated.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance reviews.</E> OCR may conduct compliance reviews or use other similar procedures as necessary to permit OCR to investigate and review the practices of the Department, Department components, recipients, and sub-recipients to determine whether they are complying with Federal conscience and anti-discrimination laws and this part. OCR may initiate a compliance review of an entity subject to this part based on information from a complaint or other source that causes OCR to suspect non-compliance by such entity with this part or the laws implemented by this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Investigations.</E> OCR shall make a prompt investigation, whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information found by OCR indicates a threatened, potential, or actual failure to comply with Federal conscience and anti-discrimination laws or this part. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices, policies, communications, documents, compliance history, circumstances under which the possible noncompliance occurred, and other factors relevant to determining whether the Department, Department component, recipient, or sub-recipient has failed to comply. OCR shall use fact-finding methods including site visits; interviews with the complainants, Department component, recipients, sub-recipients, or third-parties; and written data or discovery requests. OCR may seek the assistance of any State agency.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Failure to respond.</E> Absent good cause, the failure of an entity that is subject to this part to respond to a request for information or to a data or document request within 45 days of OCR's request shall constitute a violation of this part.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Related administrative or judicial proceeding.</E> Consistent with other applicable Federal laws, testimony and other evidence obtained in an investigation or compliance review conducted under this part may be used by the Department for, and offered into evidence in, any administrative or judicial proceeding related to this part.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Supervision and coordination.</E> If as a result of an investigation, compliance review, or other enforcement activity, OCR determines that a Department component appears to be in noncompliance with its responsibilities under Federal conscience and anti-discrimination laws or this part, OCR will undertake appropriate action with the component to assure compliance. In <PRTPAGE P="557"/>the event that OCR and the Department component are unable to agree on a resolution of any particular matter, the matter shall be submitted to the Secretary for resolution. OCR may from time to time request the assistance of officials of the Department in carrying out responsibilities in connection with the enforcement of Federal conscience and anti-discrimination laws and this part, including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Department.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Referral to the Department of Justice.</E> If as a result of an investigation, compliance review, or other enforcement activity, OCR determines that a recipient or sub-recipient is not in compliance with the Federal conscience and anti-discrimination laws or this part, OCR may, in coordination with the relevant Department component and the Office of the General Counsel, make referrals to the Department of Justice, for further enforcement in Federal court or otherwise. OCR may also make referrals to the Department of Justice, in coordination with the Office of the General Counsel, concerning potential violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001 or 42 U.S.C. 300a-8 for enforcement or other appropriate action.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Resolution of matters.</E> (1) If an investigation or compliance review reveals that no action is warranted, OCR will so inform any party who has been notified of the existence of the investigation or compliance review, if any, in writing.</P>
            <P>(2) If an investigation or compliance review indicates a failure to comply with Federal conscience and anti-discrimination laws or this part, OCR will so inform the relevant parties and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. Attempts to resolve matters informally shall not preclude OCR from simultaneously pursuing any action described in paragraphs (a)(5) through (7) of this section.</P>

            <P>(3) If OCR determines that there is a failure to comply with Federal conscience and anti-discrimination laws or this part, compliance with these laws and this part may be effected by the following actions, taken in coordination with the relevant Department component, and pursuant to statutes and regulations which govern the administration of contracts (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Federal Acquisition Regulation), grants (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 45 CFR part 75) and CMS funding arrangements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the Social Security Act):</P>

            <SUBJECT>Organizational integrity of recipients.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A recipient must have objective integrity and independence from any affiliated organization that engages in activities inconsistent with the recipient's opposition to the practices of prostitution and sex trafficking because of the psychological and physical risks they pose for women, men and children (“restricted activities”). A recipient will be found to have objective integrity and independence from such an organization if:</P>
            <P>(a) The affiliated organization receives no transfer of Leadership Act HIV/AIDS funds, and Leadership Act HIV/AIDS funds do not subsidize restricted activities; and</P>
            <P>(b) The recipient is, to the extent practicable in the circumstances, separate from the affiliated organization. Mere bookkeeping separation of Leadership Act HIV/AIDS funds from other funds is not sufficient. HHS will determine, on a case-by-case basis and based on the totality of the facts, whether sufficient separation exists. The presence or absence of any one or more factors relating to legal, physical, and financial separation will not be determinative. Factors relevant to this determination shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether the organization is a legally separate entity;</P>
            <P>(2) The existence of separate personnel or other allocation of personnel that maintains adequate separation of the activities of the affiliated organization from the recipient;</P>
            <P>(3) The existence of separate accounting and timekeeping records;</P>
            <P>(4) The degree of separation of the recipient's facilities from facilities in which restricted activities occur; and</P>
            <P>(5) The extent to which signs and other forms of identification that distinguish the recipient from the affiliated organization are present.</P>

              <P>(2) Each recipient's self-evaluation shall identify and justify each age distinction imposed by the recipient.</P>
              <P>(3) Each recipient shall take corrective and remedial action whenever a self-evaluation indicates a violation of the Act.</P>
              <P>(4) Each recipient shall make the self-evaluation available on request to the agency and to the public for a period of 3 years following its completion.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Complaints</E>—(1) <E T="03">Receipt of complaints.</E> Each agency shall establish a complaint processing procedure which includes the following:</P>

              <P>(ii) If the complainant and recipient reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of the complaint during the mediation period, they shall reduce the agreement to writing.

No further action shall be taken based on that complaint unless it appears that the complainant or the recipient is failing to comply with the agreement.</P>
              <P>(iii) Not more than 60 days after the agency receives the complaint, the mediator shall return a still unresolved complaint to the referring agency for initial investigation.

This part applies to <PRTPAGE P="576"/>health programs or activities administered by recipients of Federal financial assistance from the Department, Title I entities that administer health programs or activities, and Department-administered health programs or activities. The effective date of this part shall be July 18, 2016, except to the extent that provisions of this part require changes to health insurance or group health plan benefit design (including covered benefits, benefits limitations or restrictions, and cost-sharing mechanisms, such as coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles), such provisions, as they apply to health insurance or group health plan benefit design, have an applicability date of the first day of the first plan year (in the individual market, policy year) beginning on or after January 1, 2017.</P>

              <P>It is the policy of [Name of Covered Entity] not to discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. [Name of Covered Entity] has adopted an internal grievance procedure providing for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18116) and its implementing regulations at 45 CFR part 92, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Section 1557 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability in certain health programs and activities. Section 1557 and its implementing regulations may be examined in the office of [Name and Title of Section 1557 Coordinator], [Mailing Address], [Telephone number], [TTY number—if covered entity has one], [Fax], [Email], who has been designated to coordinate the efforts of [Name of Covered Entity] to comply with Section 1557.</P>
              <P>Any person who believes someone has been subjected to discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability may file a grievance under this procedure. It is against the law for [Name of Covered Entity] to retaliate against anyone who opposes discrimination, files a grievance, or participates in the investigation of a grievance.</P>
              <P>Procedure:</P>
              <P>• Grievances must be submitted to the Section 1557 Coordinator within (60 days) of the date the person filing the grievance becomes aware of the alleged discriminatory action.</P>
              <P>• A complaint must be in writing, containing the name and address of the person filing it. The complaint must state the problem or action alleged to be discriminatory and the remedy or relief sought.</P>
              <P>• The Section 1557 Coordinator (or her/his designee) shall conduct an investigation of the complaint. This investigation may be informal, but it will be thorough, affording all interested persons an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to the complaint. The Section 1557 Coordinator will maintain the files and records of [Name of Covered Entity] relating to such grievances. To the extent possible, and in accordance with applicable law, the Section 1557 Coordinator will take appropriate steps to preserve the confidentiality of files and records relating to grievances and will share them only with those who have a need to know.</P>
              <P>• The Section 1557 Coordinator will issue a written decision on the grievance, based on a preponderance of the evidence, no later than 30 days after its filing, including a notice to the complainant of their right to pursue further administrative or legal remedies.</P>

              <P>• The person filing the grievance may appeal the decision of the Section 1557 Coordinator by writing to the (Administrator/Chief Executive Officer/Board of Directors/etc.) within 15 days of receiving the Section 1557 Coordinator's decision. The (Administrator/<PRTPAGE P="589"/>Chief Executive Officer/Board of Directors/etc.) shall issue a written decision in response to the appeal no later than 30 days after its filing.</P>

              <P>The availability and use of this grievance procedure does not prevent a person from pursuing other legal or administrative remedies, including filing a complaint of discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability in court or with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights. A person can file a complaint of discrimination electronically through the Office for Civil Rights Complaint Portal, which is available at: <E T="03">https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/portal/lobby.jsf,</E> or by mail or phone at: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 200 Independence Avenue SW., Room 509F, HHH Building, Washington, DC 20201.</P>
              <P>Complaint forms are available at: <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/office/file/index.html.</E> Such complaints must be filed within 180 days of the date of the alleged discrimination.</P>
              <P>[Name of covered entity] will make appropriate arrangements to ensure that individuals with disabilities and individuals with limited English proficiency are provided auxiliary aids and services or language assistance services, respectively, if needed to participate in this grievance process. Such arrangements may include, but are not limited to, providing qualified interpreters, providing taped cassettes of material for individuals with low vision, or assuring a barrier-free location for the proceedings. The Section 1557 Coordinator will be responsible for such arrangements.</P>

              <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 93.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, <E T="03">professional and technical services</E> shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>

              <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 93.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responsibilities of Institutions regarding Investigator financial conflicts of interest.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Each Institution shall:</P>
            <P>(a) Maintain an up-to-date, written, enforced policy on financial conflicts of interest that complies with this part, and make such policy available via a publicly accessible Web site. If the Institution does not have any current presence on a publicly accessible Web site (and only in those cases), the Institution shall make its written policy available to any requestor within five business days of a request. If, however, the Institution acquires a presence on a publicly accessible Web site during the time of the PHS award, the requirement to post the information on that Web site will apply within 30 calendar days. If an Institution maintains a policy on financial conflicts of interest that includes standards that are more stringent than this part (e.g., that require a more extensive disclosure of financial interests), the Institution shall adhere to its policy and shall provide FCOI reports regarding identified financial conflicts of interest to the PHS Awarding Component in accordance with the Institution's own standards and within the timeframe prescribed by this part.</P>
            <P>(b) Inform each Investigator of the Institution's policy on financial conflicts of interest, the Investigator's responsibilities regarding disclosure of significant financial interests, and of these regulations, and require each Investigator to complete training regarding the same prior to engaging in research related to any PHS-funded contract and at least every four years, and immediately when any of the following circumstances apply:</P>
            <P>(1) The Institution revises its financial conflict of interest policies or procedures in any manner that affects the requirements of Investigators;</P>
            <P>(2) An Investigator is new to an Institution; or</P>
            <P>(3) An Institution finds that an Investigator is not in compliance with the Institution's financial conflict of interest policy or management plan.</P>
            <P>(c) If the Institution carries out the PHS-funded research through a subrecipient (e.g., subcontractors, or consortium members), the Institution (awardee Institution) must take reasonable steps to ensure that any subrecipient Investigator complies with this part by</P>
            <P>(1) Incorporating as part of a written agreement with the subrecipient terms that establish whether the financial conflicts of interest policy of the awardee Institution or that of the subrecipient will apply to the subrecipient's Investigators.</P>
            <P>(i) If the subrecipient's Investigators must comply with the subrecipient's financial conflicts of interest policy, the subrecipient shall certify as part of the agreement referenced above that its policy complies with this part. If the subrecipient cannot provide such certification, the agreement shall state that subrecipient Investigators are subject to the financial conflicts of interest policy of the awardee Institution for disclosing significant financial interests that are directly related to the subrecipient's work for the awardee Institution;</P>
            <P>(ii) Additionally, if the subrecipient's Investigators must comply with the subrecipient's financial conflicts of interest policy, the agreement referenced above shall specify time period(s) for the subrecipient to report all identified financial conflicts of interest to the awardee Institution. Such time period(s) shall be sufficient to enable the awardee Institution to provide timely FCOI reports, as necessary, to the PHS as required by this part;</P>

            <P>(iii) Alternatively, if the subrecipient's Investigators must comply with the awardee Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy, the agreement referenced above shall specify time period(s) for the subrecipient to submit <PRTPAGE P="604"/>all Investigator disclosures of significant financial interests to the awardee Institution. Such time period(s) shall be sufficient to enable the awardee Institution to comply timely with its review, management, and reporting obligations under this part.</P>

            <P>(2) Providing FCOI reports to the PHS Awarding Component regarding all financial conflicts of interest of all subrecipient Investigators consistent with this part, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> prior to the expenditure of funds and within 60 days of any subsequently identified FCOI.</P>
            <P>(d) Designate an institutional official(s) to solicit and review disclosures of significant financial interests from each Investigator who is planning to participate in, or is participating in, the PHS-funded research.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) Require that each Investigator who is planning to participate in the PHS-funded research disclose to the Institution's designated official(s) the Investigator's significant financial interests (and those of the Investigator's spouse and dependent children) no later than date of submission of the Institution's proposal for PHS-funded research.</P>
            <P>(2) Require each Investigator who is participating in the PHS-funded research to submit an updated disclosure of significant financial interests at least annually, in accordance with the specific time period prescribed by the Institution, during the period of the award. Such disclosure shall include any information that was not disclosed initially to the Institution pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or in a subsequent disclosure of significant financial interests (e.g., any financial conflict of interest identified on a PHS-funded project that was transferred from another Institution), and shall include updated information regarding any previously disclosed significant financial interest (e.g., the updated value of a previously disclosed equity interest).</P>
            <P>(3) Require each Investigator who is participating in the PHS-funded research to submit an updated disclosure of significant financial interests within thirty days of discovering or acquiring (e.g., through purchase, marriage, or inheritance) a new significant financial interest.</P>
            <P>(f) Provide guidelines consistent with this part for the designated institutional official(s) to determine whether an Investigator's significant financial interest is related to PHS-funded research and, if so related, whether the significant financial interest is a financial conflict of interest. An Investigator's significant financial interest is related to PHS-funded research when the Institution, through its designated official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial interest: Could be affected by the PHS-funded research; or is in an entity whose financial interest could be affected by the research. The Institution may involve the Investigator in the designated official(s)'s determination of whether a significant financial interest is related to the PHS-funded research. A financial conflict of interest exists when the Institution, through its designated official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial interest could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the PHS-funded research.</P>
            <P>(g) Take such actions as necessary to manage financial conflicts of interest, including any financial conflicts of a subrecipient Investigator pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Management of an identified financial conflict of interest requires development and implementation of a management plan and, if necessary, a retrospective review and mitigation report pursuant to § 94.5(a).</P>
            <P>(h) Provide initial and ongoing FCOI reports to the PHS as required pursuant to § 94.5(b).</P>
            <P>(i) Maintain records relating to all Investigator disclosures of financial interests and the Institution's review of, and response to, such disclosures (whether or not a disclosure resulted in the Institution's determination of a financial conflict of interest), and all actions under the Institution's policy or retrospective review, if applicable, for at least three years from the date of final payment or, where applicable, for the time periods specified in 48 CFR part 4, subpart 4.7.</P>

            <P>(j) Establish adequate enforcement mechanisms and provide for employee <PRTPAGE P="605"/>sanctions or other administrative actions to ensure Investigator compliance as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(k) Certify, in each contract proposal to which this part applies, that the Institution:</P>
            <P>(1) Has in effect at that Institution an up-to-date, written, and enforced administrative process to identify and manage financial conflicts of interest with respect to all research projects for which funding is sought or received from the PHS;</P>
            <P>(2) Shall promote and enforce Investigator compliance with this part's requirements including those pertaining to disclosure of significant financial interests;</P>
            <P>(3) Shall manage financial conflicts of interest and provide initial and ongoing FCOI reports to the PHS Awarding Component consistent with this part;</P>
            <P>(4) Agrees to make information available, promptly upon request, to the HHS relating to any Investigator disclosure of financial interests and the Institution's review of, and response to, such disclosure, whether or not the disclosure resulted in the Institution's determination of a financial conflict of interest; and</P>
            <P>(5) Shall fully comply with the requirements of this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Management and reporting of financial conflicts of interest.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Management of financial conflicts of interest.</P>
            <P>(1) Prior to the Institution's expenditure of any funds under a PHS-funded research project, the designated official(s) of an Institution shall, consistent with § 94.4(f): review all Investigator disclosures of significant financial interests; determine whether any significant financial interests relate to PHS-funded research; determine whether a financial conflict of interest exists; and, if so, develop and implement a management plan that shall specify the actions that have been, and shall be, taken to manage such financial conflict of interest. Examples of conditions or restrictions that might be imposed to manage a financial conflict of interest include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Public disclosure of financial conflicts of interest (e.g., when presenting or publishing the research);</P>
            <P>(ii) For research projects involving human subjects research, disclosure of financial conflicts of interest directly to participants;</P>
            <P>(iii) Appointment of an independent monitor capable of taking measures to protect the design, conduct, and reporting of the research against bias, resulting from the financial conflict of interest;</P>
            <P>(iv) Modification of the research plan;</P>
            <P>(v) Change of personnel or personnel responsibilities, or disqualification of personnel from participation in all or a portion of the research;</P>
            <P>(vi) Reduction or elimination of the financial interest (e.g., sale of an equity interest); or</P>
            <P>(vii) Severance of relationships that create financial conflicts.</P>
            <P>(2) Whenever, in the course of an ongoing PHS-funded research project, an Investigator who is new to participating in the research project discloses a significant financial interest or an existing Investigator discloses a new significant financial interest to the Institution, the designated official(s) of the Institution shall, within sixty days: review the disclosure of the significant financial interest; determine whether it is related to PHS-funded research; determine whether a financial conflict of interest exists; and, if so, implement, on at least an interim basis, a management plan that shall specify the actions that have been, and will be, taken to manage such financial conflict of interest. Depending on the nature of the significant financial interest, an Institution may determine that additional interim measures are necessary with regard to the Investigator's participation in the PHS-funded research project between the date of disclosure and the completion of the Institution's review.</P>

            <P>(3) Whenever an Institution identifies a significant financial interest that was not disclosed timely by an Investigator or, for whatever reason, was not previously reviewed by the Institution during an ongoing PHS-funded research project (e.g., was not timely reviewed <PRTPAGE P="606"/>or reported by a subrecipient), the designated official(s) shall, within sixty days: review the significant financial interest; determine whether it is related to PHS-funded research; determine whether a financial conflict of interest exists; and, if so:</P>
            <P>(i) Implement, on at least an interim basis, a management plan that shall specify the actions that have been, and will be, taken to manage such financial conflict of interest going forward;</P>
            <P>(ii) (A) In addition, whenever a financial conflict of interest is not identified or managed in a timely manner including failure by the Investigator to disclose a significant financial interest that is determined by the Institution to constitute a financial conflict of interest; failure by the Institution to review or manage such a financial conflict of interest; or failure by the Investigator to comply with a financial conflict of interest management plan, the Institution shall, within 120 days of the Institution's determination of noncompliance, complete a retrospective review of the Investigator's activities and the PHS-funded research project to determine whether any PHS-funded research, or portion thereof, conducted during the time period of the noncompliance, was biased in the design, conduct, or reporting of such research.</P>
            <P>(B) The Institution is required to document the retrospective review; such documentation shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, all of the following key elements:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Project number;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Project title;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) PD/PI or contact PD/PI if a multiple PD/PI model is used;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Name of the Investigator with the FCOI;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Name of the entity with which the Investigator has a financial conflict of interest;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Reason(s) for the retrospective review;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) Detailed methodology used for the retrospective review (e.g., methodology of the review process, composition of the review panel, documents reviewed);</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Findings of the review; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">9</E>) Conclusions of the review.</P>
            <P>(iii) Based on the results of the retrospective review, if appropriate, the Institution shall update the previously submitted FCOI report, specifying the actions that will be taken to manage the financial conflict of interest going forward. If bias is found, the Institution is required to notify the PHS Awarding Component promptly and submit a mitigation report to the PHS Awarding Component. The mitigation report must include, at a minimum, the key elements documented in the retrospective review above and a description of the impact of the bias on the research project and the Institution's plan of action or actions taken to eliminate or mitigate the effect of the bias (e.g., impact on the research project; extent of harm done, including any qualitative and quantitative data to support any actual or future harm; analysis of whether the research project is salvageable). Thereafter, the Institution will submit FCOI reports annually, as specified elsewhere in this part. Depending on the nature of the financial conflict of interest, an Institution may determine that additional interim measures are necessary with regard to the Investigator's participation in the PHS-funded research project between the date that the financial conflict of interest or the Investigator's noncompliance is determined and the completion of the Institution's retrospective review.</P>
            <P>(4) Whenever an Institution implements a management plan pursuant to this part, the Institution shall monitor Investigator compliance with the management plan on an ongoing basis until the completion of the PHS-funded research project.</P>
            <P>(5)(i) Prior to the Institution's expenditure of any funds under a PHS-funded research project, the Institution shall ensure public accessibility, via a publicly accessible Web site or written response to any requestor within five business days of a request, of information concerning any significant financial interest disclosed to the Institution that meets the following three criteria:</P>
            <P>(A) The significant financial interest was disclosed and is still held by key personnel as defined in this part;</P>

            <P>(B) The Institution determines that the significant financial interest is related to the PHS-funded research; and<PRTPAGE P="607"/>
            </P>
            <P>(C) The Institution determines that the significant financial interest is a financial conflict of interest.</P>
            <P>(ii) The information that the Institution makes available via a publicly accessible Web site or written response to any requestor within five business days of a request, shall include, at a minimum, the following: The Investigator's name; the Investigator's title and role with respect to the research project; the name of the entity in which the significant financial interest is held; the nature of the significant financial interest; and the approximate dollar value of the significant financial interest (dollar ranges are permissible: $0-$4,999; $5,000-$9,999; $10,000-$19,999; amounts between $20,000-$100,000 by increments of $20,000; amounts above $100,000 by increments of $50,000), or a statement that the interest is one whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value.</P>
            <P>(iii) If the Institution uses a publicly accessible Web site for the purposes of this subsection, the information that the Institution posts shall be updated at least annually. In addition, the Institution shall update the Web site within sixty days of the Institution's receipt or identification of information concerning any additional significant financial interest of the senior/key personnel for the PHS-funded research project that was not previously disclosed, or upon the disclosure of a significant financial interest of senior/key personnel new to the PHS-funded research project, if the Institution determines that the significant financial interest is related to the PHS-funded research and is a financial conflict of interest. The Web site shall note that the information provided is current as of the date listed and is subject to updates, on at least an annual basis and within 60 days of the Institution's identification of a new financial conflict of interest. If the Institution responds to written requests for the purposes of this subsection, the Institution will note in its written response that the information provided is current as of the date of the correspondence and is subject to updates, on at least an annual basis and within 60 days of the Institution's identification of a new financial conflict of interest, which should be requested subsequently by the requestor.</P>
            <P>(iv) Information concerning the significant financial interests of an individual subject to paragraph (a)(5) of this section shall remain available, for responses to written requests or for posting via the Institution's publicly accessible Web site for at least three years from the date that the information was most recently updated.</P>
            <P>(6) In addition to the types of financial conflicts of interest as defined in this part that must be managed pursuant to this section, an Institution may require the management of other financial conflicts of interest in its policy on financial conflicts of interest, as the Institution deems appropriate.</P>
            <P>(b) Reporting of financial conflicts of interest.</P>
            <P>(1) Prior to the Institution's expenditure of any funds under a PHS-funded research project, the Institution shall provide to the PHS Awarding Component an FCOI report regarding any Investigator's significant financial interest found by the Institution to be conflicting and ensure that the Institution has implemented a management plan in accordance with this part. In cases in which the Institution identifies a financial conflict of interest and eliminates it prior to the expenditure of PHS-awarded funds, the Institution shall not submit an FCOI report to the PHS Awarding Component.</P>

            <P>(2) For any significant financial interest that the Institution identifies as conflicting subsequent to the Institution's initial FCOI report during an ongoing PHS-funded research project (e.g., upon the participation of an Investigator who is new to the research project), the Institution shall provide to the PHS Awarding Component, within sixty days, an FCOI report regarding the financial conflict of interest and ensure that the Institution has implemented a management plan in accordance with this part. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, where such FCOI report involves a significant financial interest that was not disclosed timely by an Investigator or, <PRTPAGE P="608"/>for whatever reason, was not previously reviewed or managed by the Institution (e.g., was not timely reviewed or reported by a subrecipient), the Institution also is required to complete a retrospective review to determine whether any PHS-funded research, or portion thereof, conducted prior to the identification and management of the financial conflict of interest was biased in the design, conduct, or reporting of such research. Additionally, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, if bias is found, the Institution is required to notify the PHS Awarding Component promptly and submit a mitigation report to the PHS Awarding Component.</P>
            <P>(3) Any FCOI report required under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section shall include sufficient information to enable the PHS Awarding Component to understand the nature and extent of the financial conflict, and to assess the appropriateness of the Institution's management plan. Elements of the FCOI report shall include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Project/Contract number;</P>
            <P>(ii) PD/PI or Contact PD/PI if a multiple PD/PI model is used;</P>
            <P>(iii) Name of the Investigator with the financial conflict of interest;</P>
            <P>(iv) Name of the entity with which the Investigator has a financial conflict of interest;</P>
            <P>(v) Nature of the financial interest (e.g., equity, consulting fee, travel reimbursement, honorarium);</P>
            <P>(vi) Value of the financial interest (dollar ranges are permissible: $0-$4,999; $5,000-$9,999; $10,000-$19,999; amounts between $20,000-$100,000 by increments of $20,000; amounts above $100,000 by increments of $50,000), or a statement that the interest is one whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value;</P>
            <P>(vii) A description of how the financial interest relates to the PHS-funded research and the basis for the Institution's determination that the financial interest conflicts with such research; and</P>
            <P>(viii) A description of the key elements of the Institution's management plan, including:</P>
            <P>(A) Role and principal duties of the conflicted Investigator in the research project;</P>
            <P>(B) Conditions of the management plan;</P>
            <P>(C) How the management plan is designed to safeguard objectivity in the research project;</P>
            <P>(D) Confirmation of the Investigator's agreement to the management plan;</P>
            <P>(E) How the management plan will be monitored to ensure Investigator compliance; and</P>
            <P>(F) Other information as needed.</P>
            <P>(4) For any financial conflict of interest previously reported by the Institution with regard to an ongoing PHS-funded research project, the Institution shall provide to the PHS Awarding Component an annual FCOI report that addresses the status of the financial conflict of interest and any changes to the management plan for the duration of the PHS-funded research project. The annual FCOI report shall specify whether the financial conflict is still being managed or explain why the financial conflict of interest no longer exists. The Institution shall provide annual FCOI reports to the PHS Awarding Component for the duration of the project period (including extensions with or without funds) in the time and manner specified by the PHS Awarding Component.</P>
            <P>(5) In addition to the types of financial conflicts of interest as defined in this part that must be reported pursuant to this section, an Institution may require the reporting of other financial conflicts of interest in its policy on financial conflicts of interest, as the Institution deems appropriate.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Remedies.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) If the failure of an Investigator to comply with an Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy or a financial conflict of interest management plan appears to have biased the design, conduct, or reporting of the PHS-funded research, the Institution shall promptly notify the PHS Awarding Component of the corrective action <PRTPAGE P="609"/>taken or to be taken. The PHS Awarding Component will consider the situation and, as necessary, take appropriate action, or refer the matter to the Institution for further action, which may include directions to the Institution on how to maintain appropriate objectivity in the PHS-funded research project.</P>
            <P>(b) The PHS Awarding Component and/or HHS may inquire at any time (before, during, or after award) into any Investigator disclosure of financial interests and the Institution's review of, and response to, such disclosure, regardless of whether or not the disclosure resulted in the Institution's determination of a financial conflict of interest. An Institution is required to submit, or permit on site review of, all records pertinent to compliance with this part. To the extent permitted by law, HHS will maintain the confidentiality of all records of financial interests. On the basis of its review of records or other information that may be available, the PHS Awarding Component may decide that a particular financial conflict of interest will bias the objectivity of the PHS-funded research to such an extent that further corrective action is needed or that the Institution has not managed the financial conflict of interest in accordance with this part. The PHS Awarding Component may determine that issuance of a Stop Work Order by the Contracting Officer or other enforcement action is necessary until the matter is resolved.</P>
            <P>(c) In any case in which the HHS determines that a PHS-funded project of clinical research whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment has been designed, conducted, or reported by an Investigator with a financial conflict of interest that was not managed or reported by the Institution as required by this part, the Institution shall require the Investigator involved to disclose the financial conflict of interest in each public presentation of the results of the research and to request an addendum to previously published presentations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Plan requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The State shall submit a cost allocation plan for the State agency as required below to the Director, Division of Cost Allocation (DCA), in the approporiate HHS Regional Office. The plan shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Describe the procedures used to identify, measure, and allocate all costs to each of the programs operated by the State agency;</P>
              <P>(2) Conform to the accounting principles and standards prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87, and other pertinent Department regulations and instructions;</P>
              <P>(3) Be compatible with the State plan for public assistance programs described in 45 CFR Chapter II, III and XIII, and 42 CFR Chapter IV Subchapters C and D; and</P>
              <P>(4) Contain sufficient information in such detail to permit the Director, Division of Cost Allocation, after consulting with the Operating Divisions, to make an informed judgment on the correctness and fairness of the State's procedures for identifying, measuring, and allocating all costs to each of the programs operated by the State agency.</P>
              <P>(b) The cost allocation plan shall contain the following information:</P>

              <P>(1) An organizational chart showing the placement of each unit whose costs are charged to the programs operated by the State agency.<PRTPAGE P="614"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) A listing of all Federal and all non-Federal programs performed, administered, or serviced by these organizational units.</P>
              <P>(3) A description of the activities performed by each organizational unit and, where not self-explanatory an explanation of the benefits provided to Federal programs.</P>
              <P>(4) The procedures used to identify, measure, and allocate all costs to each benefiting program and activity (including activities subject to different rates of FFP).</P>
              <P>(5) The estimated cost impact resulting from the proposed changes to a previously approved plan. These estimated costs are required solely to permit an evaluation of the procedures used for identifying, measuring, and allocating costs. Therefore, approval of the cost allocation plan shall not constitute approval of these estimated costs for use in calculating claims for FFP. Where it is impractical to obtain this data, an alternative approach should then be negotiated with the Director, DCA, prior to submission of the cost allocation plan.</P>
              <P>(6) A statement stipulating that wherever costs are claimed for services provided by a governmental agency outside the State agency, that they will be supported by a written agreement that includes, at a minimum (i) the specific service(s) being purchased, (ii) the basis upon which the billing will be made by the provider agency (e.g. time reports, number of homes inspected, etc.) and (iii) a stipulation that the billing will be based on the actual cost incurred. This statement would not be required if the costs involved are specifically addressed in a State-wide cost allocation plan, local-wide cost allocation plan, or an umbrella/department cost allocation plan.</P>
              <P>(7) If the public assistance programs are administered by local government agencies under a State supervised system, the overall State agency cost allocation plan shall also include a cost allocation plan for the local agencies. It shall be developed in accordance with the requirements set forth above. More than one local agency plan shall be submitted if the accounting systems or other conditions at the local agencies preclude an equitable allocation of costs by the submission of a single plan for all local agencies. Prior to submitting multiple plans for local agencies, the State should consult with the Director, DCA. Where more than one local agency plan is submitted, the State shall identify the specific local agencies covered by each plan.</P>
              <P>(8) A certification by a duly authorized official of the State stating:</P>
              <P>(i) That the information contained in the proposed cost allocation plan was prepared in conformance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87.</P>
              <P>(ii) That the costs are accorded consistent treatment through the application of generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to the circumstances.</P>
              <P>(iii) That an adequate accounting and statistical system exists to support claims that will be made under the cost allocation plan; and</P>
              <P>(iv) That the information provided in support of the proposed cost allocation plan is accurate.</P>
              <P>(9) Other information as is necessary to establish the validity of the procedures used to identify, measure, and allocate costs to all programs being operated by the State agency.</P>

              <P>(1) The procedures shown in the existing cost allocation plan become outdated because of organizational changes, changes in Federal law or regulations, or significant changes in program levels, affecting the validity of the approved cost allocation procedures.</P>
              <P>(2) A material defect is discovered in the cost allocation plan by the Director, DCA or the State.</P>
              <P>(3) The State plan for public assistance programs is amended so as to affect the allocation of costs.</P>

              <P>(4) Other changes occur which make the allocation basis or procedures in the approval cost allocation plan invalid.<PRTPAGE P="615"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) If a State has not submitted a plan or plan amendment during a given State fiscal year, an annual statement shall be submitted to the Director, DCA certifying that its approved cost allocation plan is not outdated.

              <P>(a) The Director, DCA, after consulting with the affected Operating Divisions, shall notify the State in writing of his/her findings. This notification will be made within 60 days after receipt of the proposed plan or amendment and shall either: (1) Advise the State that the plan or plan amendment is approved or disapproved, (2) advise the State of the changes required to make the plan or amendment acceptable, or (3) request the State to provide additional information needed to evaluate the proposed plan or amendment. If the DCA cannot make a determination within the 60-day period, it shall so advise the State.</P>
              <P>(b) For purpose of this subpart, State agency cost allocation plans which have been approved by an authorized official of the Department of HHS prior to the effective date of this regulation are considered approved until such time as a new plan or plan amendment is required by § 95.509(a).</P>

              <P>As a general rule, the effective date of a cost allocation plan amendment shall be the first day of the calendar quarter following the date of the event that required the amendment (See § 95.509). However, the effective date of the amendment may be earlier or later under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(a) An earlier date is needed to avoid a significant inequity to either the State or the Federal Government.</P>
              <P>(b) The information provided by the State which was used to approve a previous plan or plan amendment is later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate, or the previously approved plan is later found to violate a Federal statute or regulation. In either situation, the effective date of any required modification to the plan will be the same as the effective date of the plan or plan amendment that contained the defect.</P>
              <P>(c) It is impractical for the State to implement the amendment on the first day of the next calendar quarter. In these instances, a later date may be established by agreement between the State and the DCA.</P>

              <P>(a) A State must claim FFP for costs associated with a program only in accordance with its approved cost allocation plan. However, if a State has submitted a plan or plan amendment for a State agency, it may, at its option claim FFP based on the proposed plan or plan amendment, unless otherwise advised by the DCA. However, where a State has claimed costs based on a proposed plan or plan amendment the State, if necessary, shall retroactively adjust its claims in accordance with the plan or amendment as subsequently approved by the Director, DCA. The State may also continue to claim FFP under its existing approved cost allocation plan for all costs not affected by the proposed amendment.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) If the issue affects the program(s) of only one Operating Division and does not affect the programs of other Operating Divisions or Federal departments, that Operating Division will determine the amount of the disallowance and will also inform the State of its opportunity for reconsideration of the determination in accordance with the Operating Division's procedures.

The Director, DCA will notify the State of this determination, of the dollar affect of the determination on the claims made under each program, and will inform the State of its opportunity for appeal of the determination under 45 CFR part 16. The State will subsequently be notified by the appropriate Operating Division as to the disposition of the funds in question.</P>

States with large, independent counties requesting funding at the regular match rate for county systems are strongly encouraged to engage in planning activities commensurate with the complexity of the projected ADP project and to submit a Planning APD to allow for time and to provide funding for its planning activities. Therefore, States must consider the scope and complexity of a project to determine whether to submit a Planning APD as a separate document to HHS or whether to combine the two phases of planning and implementation into one APD covering both the Planning APD and the Implementation APD requirements.</P>
                <P>(2) The Planning APD is a relatively brief document, usually not more than 6-10 pages, which must contain:</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General acquisition requirements.</E> (1) A State shall obtain prior approval from the Department which is reflected in a record, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, when the State plans to acquire ADP equipment or services with proposed FFP at the regular matching rate that it anticipates will have total acquisition costs of $5,000,000 or more in Federal and State funds. States will be required to submit an Operational APDU only if they exceed the threshold requiring Federal approval, and only upon the receipt of a submission request, which is reflected in a record, from the Department. See definition of software maintenance under § 95.605.</P>

                <P>(2) A State must obtain prior approval from the Department which is reflected in a record, as specified in <PRTPAGE P="623"/>paragraph (b) of this section, when the State plans to acquire ADP equipment or services with proposed FFP at the enhanced matching rate subject to one of the following:</P>
                <P>(i) If authorized by § 205.35 of this title and part 307 of this title, regardless of the acquisition cost.</P>
                <P>(ii) If authorized by 42 CFR part 433, subpart C, if the contract is anticipated to or will exceed $500,000.</P>
                <P>(3) A State shall obtain prior approval from the Department, which is reflected in a record, for a sole source/non-competitive acquisition, of ADP equipment or services with a total State and Federal acquisition cost of $1,000,000 or more.</P>
                <P>(4) Except as provided for in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the State shall submit multi-program requests for Department approval, signed by the appropriate State official, to the Department's Secretary or his/her designee.

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Prompt action on requests for prior approval.</E> The Department will promptly send to the approving Federal program offices the items specified in paragraph (b) of this section. If the Department has not provided approval, disapproval, or a request for information which is reflected in a record, within 60 days of the date of the Departmental letter acknowledging receipt of a State's request, the Department will consider the request to have provisionally met the prior approval conditions of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Acquisitions not subject to prior approval.</E> If the Department has not specifically requested in a record, the submittal of additional acquisition documentation for those acquisitions summarized in the APD, the approval of the Planning, Annual or As-Needed APDU will constitute an exemption of the acquisition documents from prior Federal approval. States will be required to submit acquisition documents, contracts and contract amendments under the threshold amounts on <PRTPAGE P="625"/>an exception basis if requested to do so in a record by the Department.</P>

A waiver is subject to the APD suspension provisions in § 95.611(c)(3). When a waiver is disapproved, the entire APD will be disapproved. The APD disapproval is a final administrative decision and is not subject to administrative appeal.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Equipment management and disposition.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Once equipment, whose costs are claimed for Federal financial participation (i.e., equipment that is capitalized and depreciated or is claimed in the period acquired), has reached the end of its useful life (as defined in an approved APD), the equipment shall be subject to the property disposal rules in § 75.320.</P>
              <P>(b) The State agency is responsible for adequately managing the equipment, maintaining records on the equipment, and taking periodic physical inventories. Physical inventories may be made on the basis of statistical sampling. The following requirements apply to the disposition of this equipment:</P>
              <P>(1) If the cost of the equipment was claimed in the period acquired and the equipment is later sold, the proceeds of the sale shall be credited to current expenditures in approximate proportion to the distribution of the equipment's cost.</P>
              <P>(2) If the cost of the equipment was claimed in the period acquired and the equipment is later transferred to an activity which is not involved in the performance of programs currently or previously funded by the Federal Government, an amount equal to the fair market value of the equipment on the date of the transfer shall be credited to current expenditures in approximate proportion to the distribution of the equipment's costs.</P>
              <P>(3) If the cost of the equipment was claimed in the period acquired and the equipment is later traded in on other equipment claims for Federal financial participation in the costs of replacement equipment shall be limited to the additional outlay.</P>
              <P>(4) If the equipment was depreciated, any gain or loss on the disposition of the equipment shall be treated as a decrease or an increase to the depreciation expense of the period in which the disposition takes place. This provision does not apply to equipment whose costs were claimed for Federal financial participation through use allowances.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General determination.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Department has determined that, with the exception of the circumstances addressed in paragraph (c) of this section, Indian tribes and tribal organizations would be better served by means of grants provided directly by the Department to such tribes and organizations out of their State's allotment of block grant funds than if the State were awarded its entire allotment. Accordingly, with the exception of situations described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Department will, upon request of an eligible Indian tribe or tribal organization and where provided for by statute, reserve a portion of the allotment of the State(s) in which the tribe is located, and, upon receipt of a complete application and related submission meeting statutory and regulatory requirements, grant it directly to the tribe or organization.</P>
              <P>(b) An Indian tribe or tribal organization may request direct funding under a block grant program included in this subpart regardless of whether the State in which it is located is receiving funds under the block grant program.</P>

              <P>(c) The Department has determined that Indian tribal members eligible for the funds or services provided through the block grants would be better served <PRTPAGE P="638"/>by the State(s) in which the tribe is located rather than by the tribe, where:</P>
              <P>(1) The tribe has not used its block grant allotment substantially in accordance with the provisions of the relevant statute(s); and</P>
              <P>(2) Following the procedures of 45 CFR 96.51, the Department has withheld tribal funds because of those deficiencies; and</P>
              <P>(3) The tribe has not provided sufficient evidence that it has removed or corrected the reason(s) for withholding. In these cases, block grant funds reserved or set aside for a direct grant to the Indian tribe will be awarded to the State(s), and the State(s) will provide block grant services to the service population of the tribe. Before awarding these funds to the State(s), the Department will allow as much time as it determines to be reasonable for the tribe to correct the conditions that led to withholding, consistent with provision of timely and meaningful services to the tribe's service population during the fiscal year. If a State(s) is awarded funds under this paragraph, the State(s) will receive all remaining funds set aside for the tribe for the Federal fiscal year for which the award is made. Where the Department has withheld funds from a tribe and the tribe has not taken satisfactory corrective action by the first day of the following fiscal year, all of the funds to serve the tribe's service population for the following fiscal year will be awarded to the State(s). The State(s) is responsible for providing services to the service population of the tribe in these cases. This paragraph also applies when funds are withheld from a tribal organization.</P>

              <P>(b) A tribal organization representing more than one Indian tribe will be eligible to receive block grant funds on behalf of a particular tribe only if the tribe has by resolution authorized the organization's action.</P>
              <P>(c) If an Indian tribe or tribal organization whose service population resides in more than one State applies for block grant funds that, by statute, are apportioned on the basis of population, the allotment awarded to the tribe or organization shall be taken from the allotments of the various States in which the service population resides in proportion to the number of eligible members or households to be served in each State. If block grant funds are required to be apportioned on the basis of grants during a base year, the allotment to the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall be taken from the allotment of the State whose base year grants included the relevant grants to the tribe or organization.</P>
              <P>(d) The audit required under the block grant programs shall be conducted by an entity that is independent of the Indian tribe or tribal organization receiving grant funds from the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(e) Beginning with fiscal year 1983, any request by an Indian tribe or tribal organization for direct funding by the Secretary must be submitted to the Secretary, together with the required application and related materials, by September 1 preceding the Federal fiscal year for which funds are sought. A separate application is required for each block grant. After the September 1 deadline, tribal applications will be accepted only with the concurrence of the State (or States) in which the tribe or tribal organization is located.</P>

              <P>(f) A State receiving block grant funds is not required to use those funds to provide tangible benefits (e.g., cash or goods) to Indians who are within the service population of an Indian tribe or tribal organization that received direct funding from the Department under the same block grant program for the same fiscal year. A State, however, may not deny Indians access to intangible services funded by block grant <PRTPAGE P="639"/>programs (e.g., treatment at a community health center) even if the Indians are members of a tribe receiving direct funding for a similar service. A tribe receiving direct block grant funding is not required to use those funds to provide tangible benefits to non-Indians living within the tribe's service area unless the tribe and the State(s) in which the tribe is located agree in writing that the tribe will do so.</P>

              <P>(b) The terms <E T="03">Indian tribe</E> and <E T="03">tribal organization</E> as used in the Reconciliation Act have the same meaning given such terms in section 4(b) and 4(c) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b).

              <P>(e) An Indian tribe or tribal organization is not required to comply with section 675(b) (42 U.S.C. 9904(b)) or to provide the certifications required by the following other provisions of the Reconciliation Act.</P>

              <P>(1) Multiplying their allotment under section 674 of the Reconciliation Act (42 U.S.C. 9903) by five percent; or</P>

              <P>(a) This section applies to direct funding of Indian tribes and tribal organizations under the substance abuse prevention and treatment Block Grant.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purpose of determining eligible applicants under section 1933(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300x-33(d)) an Indian tribe or tribal organization (as defined in subsections (b) and (c) of section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act) that received a direct grant under subpart I of part B of title XIX of the PHS Act (as such existed prior to October 1, 1992) in fiscal year 1991 will be considered eligible for a grant under subpart 2 of part B of title XIX of the PHS Act.</P>
              <P>(c) For purposes of the substance abuse prevention and treatment Block Grant, an Indian tribe or tribal organization is not required to comply with the following statutory provisions of the Public Health Service Act: 1923 (42 U.S.C. 300x-23), 1925 (42 U.S.C. 300x-25), 1926 (42 U.S.C. 300x-26), 1928 (42 U.S.C. 300x-28), 1929 (42 U.S.C. 300x-29), and 1943(a)(1) (42 U.S.C. 300x-53(a)(1)). An Indian tribe or tribal organization is to comply with all other statutes and regulations applicable to the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant. In each case in which an Indian Tribe receives a direct grant, the State is also responsible for providing services to Native Americans under the State's Block Grant program.</P>

              <P>(b) The terms <E T="03">Indian tribe</E> and <E T="03">tribal organization</E> as used in the Reconciliation Act have the same meaning given such terms in section 4(b) and 4(c) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b) except that the terms shall also include organized groups of Indians that the State in which they reside has expressly determined are Indian tribes or tribal organizations in accordance with State procedures for making such determinations.</P>
              <P>(c) For purposes of section 2604(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 8623(d)), an organized group of Indians is eligible for direct funding based on State recognition if the State has expressly determined that the group is an Indian tribe. A statement by the State's chief executive officer verifying that a tribe is recognized by that State will also be sufficient to verify State recognition for the purpose of direct funding.</P>
              <P>(d) The plan required by section 2604(d)(4) of the Reconciliation Act (42 U.S.C. 8623(d)(4)) shall contain the certification and information required for States under section 2605 (b) and (c) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 8624 (b) and (c)).

After December 15, funds will revert to the State(s) in which the tribe is located, unless the State(s) agrees to a later date. If funds revert to a State, the State is responsible for providing low-income home energy assistance program services to the service population of the tribe.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Complaints.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section applies to any complaint (other than a complaint alleging violation of the nondiscrimination provisions) that a State has failed to use its allotment under a block grant in accordance with the terms of the act establishing the block grant or the certifications and assurances made by the State pursuant to that act. The Secretary is not required to consider a complaint unless it is submitted as required by this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Complaints with respect to the health block grants must be submitted in writing to either the Assistant Secretary for Health or: For the preventive health and health services block grant, the Director, Centers for Disease Control; for the alcohol and drug abuse and mental health services block grant, the Administrator, Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration; for the maternal and child health services block grant, the Administrator, Health Resources and Services Administration. Complaints with respect to the social services block grant must be submitted in writing to the Assistant Secretary for Human Development Services. Complaints with respect to the low-income home energy assistance program and the community services block grant must be submitted in writing to the Director, Office of Community Services. (The address for the Director, Center for Disease Control is 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30333. For each of the other officials cited above the address is 200 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20201.) The complaint must identify the provision of the act, assurance, or certification that was allegedly violated; must specify the basis for the violations it charges; and must include all relevant information known to the person submitting it.</P>
              <P>(c) The Department shall promptly furnish a copy of any complaint to the affected State. Any comments received from the State within 60 days (or such longer period as may be agreed upon between the State and the Department) shall be considered by the Department in responding to the complaint. The Department will conduct an investigation of complaints where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) The Department will provide a written response to complaints within 180 days after receipt. If a final resolution cannot be provided at that time, the response will state the reasons why additional time is necessary. Under the low-income home energy assistance program, within 60 days after receipt of complaints, the Department will provide a written response to the complainant, stating the actions that it has taken to date and, if the complaint has not yet been fully resolved, the timetable for final resolution of the complaint.</P>

              <P>(e) The Department recognizes that under the block grant programs the States are primarily responsible for interpreting the governing statutory provisions. As a result, various States may reach different interpretations of <PRTPAGE P="642"/>the same statutory provisions. This circumstance is consistent with the intent of and statutory authority for the block grant programs. In resolving any issue raised by a complaint or a Federal audit the Department will defer to a State's interpretation of its assurances and of the provisions of the block grant statutes unless the interpretation is clearly erroneous. In any event, the Department will provide copies of complaints to the independent entity responsible for auditing the State's activities under the block grant program involved. Any determination by the Department that a State's interpretation is not clearly erroneous shall not preclude or otherwise prejudice the State auditors' consideration of the question.</P>

Notwithstanding part 16 of this title, in the event of such a referral, the Board shall issue a recommended decision that will not become final until affirmed, reversed, or modified by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(d) Any appeal to the Grant Appeals Board under this section shall be governed by part 16 of this title except that the Board shall not hold a hearing. The Board shall accept any findings with respect to credibility of witnesses made by the presiding officer. The Board may otherwise review and supplement the record as provided for in part 16 of this title and decide the issues raised.</P>

              <P>(b) A State offered an opportunity for a hearing has the amount of time specified in the notice, which may not be less than 10 days after receipt of the notice, within which to request a hearing. The request may be filed by mail, telegram, telex, personal delivery, or any other mode of written communication, addressed to the designated Department employee. If no response is filed within that time, the offer is deemed to have been refused and no hearing will be held.</P>
              <P>(c) If a hearing is requested, the Department will designate a presiding officer, and (subject to § 96.51 of this part) the hearing will take place at a time and location agreed upon by the State requesting the hearing, the Department, and the presiding officer or, if agreement cannot be reached, at a reasonable time and location designated by the presiding officer.</P>

The State may then present any oral or written information relevant to the hearing. Both parties may confront and conduct reasonable cross-examination of any person (except for the presiding officer and counsel for the parties) who makes any statement on the matter at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) The hearing is informal in nature, and the rules of evidence do not apply. No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information and views will be made or considered, but either party may comment upon or rebut all such data, information, and views.</P>
              <P>(d) The presiding officer may order the hearing to be transcribed. The State may have the hearing transcribed, at the State's expense, in which case a copy of the transcript is to be furnished to the Department at the Department's expense.</P>
              <P>(e) The presiding officer may, if appropriate, allow for the submission of post-hearing briefs. The presiding officer shall prepare a written decision, which shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence, shall include a statement of reasons for the decision, and shall be final unless appealed pursuant to § 96.52 of this part. If post-hearing briefs were not permitted, the parties to the hearing will be given the opportunity to review and comment on the presiding officer's decision prior to its being issued.</P>
              <P>(f) The presiding officer shall include as part of the decision a finding on the credibility of witnesses (other than expert witnesses) whenever credibility is a material issue.</P>

The presiding officer may direct that the hearing be conducted in any suitable manner permitted by law and these regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Annual reporting requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Annual report.</E> In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 1397e, each state must submit an annual report to the Secretary by the due dates specified in § 96.17 of this part. The annual report must cover the most recently completed fiscal year and, except for the data in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section, may be submitted in the format of the state's choice. The annual report must address the requirements in section 2006(a) of the Act, include the specific data required by section 2006(c), and include other information as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The number of individuals who receive services paid for in whole or in part with federal funds under the Social Services Block Grant, showing separately the number of children and the number of adults who received such services (section 2006(c)(1));</P>
              <P>(2) The amount of Social Services Block Grant funds spent in providing each service, showing separately for each service the average amount spent per child recipient and per adult recipient (section 2006(c)(2));</P>
              <P>(3) The total amount of federal, state and local funds spent in providing each service, including Social Services Block Grant funds;</P>
              <P>(4) The method(s) by which each service is provided, showing separately the services provided by public agencies, private agencies, or both (section 2006(c)(4)); and</P>
              <P>(5) The criteria applied in determining eligibility for each service such as income eligibility guidelines, sliding fee scales, the effect of public assistance benefits, and any requirements for enrollment in school or training programs (section 2006(c)(3)).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reporting requirement.</E> (1) Each state must use the uniform definitions of services in appendix A of this part, <PRTPAGE P="646"/>categories 1-28, in submitting the data required in paragraph (a) of this section. Where a state cannot use the uniform definitions, it should report the data under category 29, “Other Services.” The state's definitions of each of the services listed in category 29 must be included in the annual report.</P>
              <P>(2) Each state must use the reporting form issued by the Department to report the data required in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) In reporting recipient and expenditure data, each state must report actual numbers of recipients and actual expenditures when this information is available. For purposes of this report, each state should, if possible, count only a single recipient for each service. States should also consider a service provided to a recipient for the length of the reporting period (one year) or any fraction thereof as a single service. Data based on sampling and/or estimates will be accepted when actual figures are unavailable. Each state must indicate for each service whether the data are based on actual figures, sampling, or estimates and must describe the sampling and/or estimation process(es) it used to obtain these data in the annual report. Each state must also indicate, in reporting recipient data, whether the data reflects an unduplicated count of recipients.</P>
              <P>(4) Each state must use category 30, “Other Expenditures,” to report non-service expenditures. Only total dollar amounts in this category are required, i.e., they need not be reported by recipient count or cost per adult/child. This will include carry over balances, carry forward balances, funds transferred to or from the SSBG program, and administrative costs as defined by the state.</P>
              <P>(5) Each state must use its own definition of the terms “child” and “adult” in reporting the data required in paragraphs (a) (1) through (5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) Each state's definition of “child” and “adult” must be reported as a part of the eligibility criteria for each service required in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The data on eligibility criteria may be submitted in whatever format the state chooses as a part of its annual report.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Transfer of computer data.</E> In addition to making the annual report available to the public and to the Department, a state may submit the information specified in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section using electronic equipment. A full description of procedures for electronic transmission of data, and of the availability of computer diskettes, is included in appendix B to this part.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section concerns requests for waivers increasing from 15 percent to up to 25 percent of LIHEAP funds allotted or available to a grantee for a fiscal year, the maximum amount that grantees may use for low-cost residential weatherization and other energy-related home repair for low-income households (hereafter referred to as “weatherization”), pursuant to section 2605(k) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8624(k)).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Public inspection and comment.</E> Before submitting waiver requests to the Department, grantees must make proposed waiver requests available for public inspection within their jurisdictions in a manner that will facilitate timely and meaningful review of, and comment upon, these requests. Written public comments on proposed waiver requests must be made available for public inspection upon their receipt by grantees, as must any summaries prepared of written comments, and transcripts and/or summaries of verbal comments made on proposed requests at public meetings or hearings. Proposed waiver requests, and any preliminary waiver requests, must be made available for public inspection and comment until at least March 15 of the fiscal year for which the waiver is to be requested. Copies of actual waiver requests must be made available for public inspection upon submission of the requests to the Department.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Waiver request.</E> After March 31 of each fiscal year, the chief executive officer (or his or her designee) may request a waiver of the weatherization obligation limit for this fiscal year, if the grantee meets criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), and (c)(2)(iii) of this section, or can show “good cause” for obtaining a waiver despite a failure to meet one or more of these criteria. (If the request is made by the chief executive officer's designee and the Department does not have on file written evidence of the designation, the request also must include evidence of the appropriate delegation of authority.) Waiver requests must be in writing and must include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section. The grantee may submit a preliminary waiver request for a fiscal year, between February 1 and March 31 of the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested. If a grantee chooses to submit a preliminary waiver request, the preliminary request must include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section; in addition, after March 31 the chief executive officer (or his or her designee) must submit the information specified in <PRTPAGE P="648"/>paragraphs (c)(7) through (c)(10) of this section, to complete the preliminary waiver request.</P>
              <P>(1) A statement of the total percent of its LIHEAP funds allotted or available in the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested, that the grantee desires to use for weatherization.</P>

              <P>(i) In the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested, the combined total (aggregate) number of households in the grantee's service population that will receive LIHEAP heating, cooling, and crisis assistance benefits that are provided from Federal LIHEAP allotments from regular and supplemental appropriations will not be fewer than the combined total (aggregate) number that received such benefits in the preceding fiscal year;</P>
              <P>(ii) In the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested, the combined total (aggregate) amount, in dollars, of LIHEAP heating, cooling, and crisis assistance benefits received by the grantee's service population that are provided from Federal LIHEAP allotments from regular and supplemental appropriations will not be less than the combined total (aggregate) amount received in the preceding fiscal year; and</P>
              <P>(iii) All LIHEAP weatherization activities to be carried out by the grantee in the fiscal year for which the wavier is requested have been shown to produce measurable savings in energy expenditures.</P>
              <P>(3) With regard to criterion in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a statement of the grantee's best estimate of the appropriate household totals for the fiscal year for which the wavier is requested and for the preceding fiscal year.</P>

              <P>(5) With regard to criterion in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, a description of the weatherization activities to be carried out by the grantee in the fiscal year for which the wavier is requested (with all LIHEAP funds proposed to be used for weatherization, not just with the amount over 15 percent), and an explanation of the specific criteria under which the grantee has determined whether these activities have been shown to produce measurable savings in energy expenditures.</P>
              <P>(6) A description of how and when the proposed wavier request was made available for timely and meaningful public review and comment, copies and/or summaries of public comments received on the request (including transcripts and/or summaries of any comments made on the request at public meetings or hearings), a statement of the method for reviewing public comments, and a statement of the changes, if any, that were made in response to these comments.</P>
              <P>(7) To complete a preliminary waiver request: Official confirmation that the grantee wishes approval of the waiver request.</P>
              <P>(8) To complete a preliminary waiver request: A statement of whether any public comments were received after preparation of the preliminary waiver request and, if so, copies and/or summaries of these comments (including transcripts and/or summaries of any comments made on the request at public meetings or hearings), and a statement of the changes, if any, that were made in response to these comments.</P>
              <P>(9) To complete a preliminary waiver request: A statement of whether any material/substantive changes of fact have occurred in information included in the preliminary waiver request since its submission, and, if so, a description of the change(s).</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">“Standard” waiver.</E> If the Department determines that a grantee has meet the three criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, has provided all information required by paragraph (c) of this section, has shown adequate concern for timely and meaningful public review and comment, and has proposed weatherization that meets all relevant requirements of title XXVI of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and 45 CFR part 96, the Department will approve a “standard” waiver.<PRTPAGE P="649"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">“Good cause” waiver.</E> (1) If a grantee does not meet one or more of the three criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, then the grantee may submit documentation that demonstrates good cause why a waiver should be granted despite the grantee's failure to meet this criterion or these criteria. “Good cause” waiver requests must include the following information, in addition to the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) For each criterion under paragraph (c)(2) of this section that the grantee does not meet, an explanation of the specific reasons demonstrating good cause why the grantee does not meet the criterion and yet proposes to use additional funds for weatherization, citing measurable, quantified data, and stating the source(s) of the data used;</P>
              <P>(ii) A statement of the grantee's LIHEAP heating, cooling, and crisis assistance eligibility standards (eligibility criteria) and benefits levels for the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested and for the preceding fiscal year; and, if eligibility standards were less restrictive and/or benefit levels were higher in the preceding fiscal year for one or more of these program components, an explanation of the reasons demonstrating good cause why a waiver should be granted in spite of this fact;</P>
              <P>(iii) A statement of the grantee's opening and closing dates for applications for LIHEAP heating, cooling, and crisis assistance in the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested and in the preceding fiscal year, and a description of the grantee's outreach efforts for heating, cooling, and crisis assistance in the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested and in the preceding fiscal year, and, if the grantee's application period was longer and/or outreach efforts were greater in the preceding fiscal year for one or more of these program components, an explanation of the reasons demonstrating good cause why a waiver should be granted in spite of this fact; and</P>
              <P>(iv) If the grantee took, or will take, other actions that led, or will lead, to a reduction in the number of applications for LIHEAP heating, cooling, and/or crisis assistance, from the preceding fiscal year to the fiscal year for which the waiver is requested, a description of these actions and an explanation demonstrating good cause why a waiver should be granted in spite of these actions.</P>

              <P>(2) If the Department determines that a grantee requesting a “good cause” waiver has demonstrated good cause why a waiver should be granted, has provided all information required by paragraphs (c) and (e)(1) of this section, has shown adequate concern for timely and meaningful public review and comment, and has proposed weatherization that meets all relevant requirements of title XXVI of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and 45 CFR part 96, the Department will approve a “good cause” waiver.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Approvals and disapprovals.</E> After receiving the grantee's complete waiver request, the Department will respond in writing within 45 days, informing the grantee whether the request is approved on either a “standard” or “good cause” basis. The Department may request additional information and/or clarification from the grantee. If additional information and/or clarification is requested, the 45-day period for the Department's response will start when the additional information and/or clarification is received. No waiver will be granted for a previous fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Effective period.</E> Waivers will be effective from the date of the Department's written approval until the funds for which the waiver is granted are obligated in accordance with title XXVI of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and 45 CFR part 96. Funds for which a weatherization waiver was granted that are carried over to the following fiscal year and used for weatherization shall not be considered “funds allotted” or “funds available” for the purposes of calculating the maximum amount that may be used for weatherization in the succeeding fiscal year.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope and eligible grantees.</E> (1) This section concerns the leveraging incentive program authorized by section 2607A of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8626a).</P>

              <P>(2)(i) The only entities eligible to receive leveraging incentive funds from the Department are States (including the District of Columbia), Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and territories that received direct Federal LIHEAP funding under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) in both the base period for which leveraged resources are reported, and the <PRTPAGE P="651"/>award period for which leveraging incentive funds are sought; and tribes and tribal organizations described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Indian tribes that received LIHEAP services under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) through a directly-funded tribal organization in the base period for which leveraged resources are reported, and receive direct Federal LIHEAP funding under section 2602(b) in the award period, will receive leveraging incentive funds allocable to them if they submit leveraging reports meeting all applicable requirements. If the tribal organization continues to receive direct funding under section 2602(b) in the award period, the tribal organization also will receive incentive funds allocable to it if it submits a leveraging report meeting all applicable requirements. In such cases, incentive funds will be allocated among the involved entities that submit leveraging reports, as agreed by these entities. If they cannot agree, HHS will allocate incentive funds based on the comparative role of each entity in obtaining and/or administering the leveraged resources, and/or their relative number of LIHEAP-eligible households.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Basic requirements for leveraged resources and benefits.</E> (1) In order to be counted under the leveraging incentive program, leveraged resources and benefits must meet all of the following five criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) They are from non-Federal sources.</P>
              <P>(ii) They are provided to the grantee's low-income home energy assistance program, or to federally qualified low-income households as described in section 2605(b)(2) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8624(b)(2)).</P>
              <P>(iii) They are measurable and quantifiable in dollars.</P>
              <P>(iv) They represent a net addition to the total home energy resources available to low-income households in excess of the amount of such resources that could be acquired by these households through the purchase of home energy, or the purchase of items that help these households meet the cost of home energy, at commonly available household rates or costs, or that could be obtained with regular LIHEAP allotments provided under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)).</P>
              <P>(v) They meet the requirements for countable leveraged resources and benefits throughout this section and section 2607A of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8626a).</P>
              <P>(2) Also, in order to be counted under the leveraging incentive program, leveraged resources and benefits must meet at least one of the following three criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) The grantee's LIHEAP program had an active, substantive role in developing and/or acquiring the resource/benefits from home energy vendor(s) through negotiation, regulation, and/or competitive bid. The actions or efforts of one or more staff of the grantee's LIHEAP program—at the central and/or local level—and/or one or more staff of LIHEAP program subrecipient(s) acting in that capacity, were substantial and significant in obtaining the resource/benefits from the vendor(s).</P>
              <P>(ii) The grantee appropriated or mandated the resource/benefits for distribution to low-income households through (that is, within and as a part of) its LIHEAP program. The resource/benefits are provided through the grantee's LIHEAP program to low-income households eligible under the grantee's LIHEAP standards, in accordance with the LIHEAP statute and regulations and consistent with the grantee's LIHEAP plan and program policies that were in effect during the base period, as if they were provided from the grantee's Federal LIHEAP allotment.</P>

              <P>(iii) The grantee appropriated or mandated the resource/benefits for distribution to low-income households as described in its LIHEAP plan (referred <PRTPAGE P="653"/>to in section 2605(c)(1)(A) of Public Law 97-35) (42 U.S.C. 8624(c)(1)(A)). The resource/benefits are provided to low-income households as a supplement and/or alternative to the grantee's LIHEAP program, outside (that is, not through, within, or as a part of) the LIHEAP program. The resource/benefits are integrated and coordinated with the grantee's LIHEAP program. Before the end of the base period, the plan identifies and describes the resource/benefits, their source(s), and their integration/coordination with the LIHEAP program. The Department will determine resources/benefits to be integrated and coordinated with the LIHEAP program if they meet at least one of the following eight conditions. If a resource meets at least one of conditions A through F when the grantee's LIHEAP program is operating (and meets all other applicable requirements), the resource also is countable when the LIHEAP program is not operating.</P>
              <P>(A) For all households served by the resource, the assistance provided by the resource depends on and is determined by the assistance provided to these households by the grantee's LIHEAP program in the base period. The resource supplements LIHEAP assistance that was not sufficient to meet households' home energy needs, and the type and amount of assistance provided by the resource is directly affected by the LIHEAP assistance received by the households.</P>
              <P>(B) Receipt of LIHEAP assistance in the base period is necessary to receive assistance from the resource. The resource serves only households that received LIHEAP assistance in the base period.</P>
              <P>(C) Ineligibility for the grantee's LIHEAP program, or denial of LIHEAP assistance in the base period because of unavailability of LIHEAP funds, is necessary to receive assistance from the resource.</P>
              <P>(D) For discounts and waivers: eligibility for and/or receipt of assistance under the grantee's LIHEAP program in the base period, and/or eligibility under the Federal standards set by section 2605(b)(2) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8624(b)(2)), is necessary to receive the discount or waiver.</P>
              <P>(E) During the period when the grantee's LIHEAP program is operating, staff of the grantee's LIHEAP program and/or staff assigned to the LIHEAP program by a local LIHEAP administering agency or agencies, and staff assigned to the resource communicate orally and/or in writing about how to meet the home energy needs of specific, individual households. For the duration of the LIHEAP program, this communication takes place before assistance is provided to each household to be served by the resource, unless the applicant for assistance from the resource presents documentation of LIHEAP eligibility and/or the amount of LIHEAP assistance received or to be received.</P>
              <P>(F) A written agreement between the grantee's LIHEAP program or local LIHEAP administering agency, and the agency administering the resource, specifies the following about the resource: eligibility criteria; benefit levels; period of operation; how the LIHEAP program and the resource are integrated/coordinated; and relationship between LIHEAP eligibility and/or benefit levels, and eligibility and/or benefit levels for the resource. The agreement provides for annual or more frequent reports to be provided to the LIHEAP program by the agency administering the resource.</P>
              <P>(G) The resource accepts referrals from the grantee's LIHEAP program, and as long as the resource has benefits available, it provides assistance to all households that are referred by the LIHEAP program and that meet the resource's eligibility requirements. Under this condition, only the benefits provided to households referred by the LIHEAP program are countable.</P>

              <P>(H) Before the grantee's LIHEAP heating, cooling, crisis, and/or weatherization assistance component(s) open and/or after the grantee's LIHEAP heating, cooling, crisis, and/or weatherization assistance component(s) close for the season or for the fiscal year, or before the entire LIHEAP program opens and/or after the entire LIHEAP program closes for the season or for the fiscal year, the resource is made available specifically to fill the gap caused by the absence of the LIHEAP component(s) or program. The resource is not <PRTPAGE P="654"/>available while the LIHEAP component(s) or program is operating.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Countable leveraged resources and benefits.</E> Resources and benefits that are countable under the leveraging incentive program include but are not limited to the following, provided that they also meet all other applicable requirements:</P>

Payments to or on behalf of low-income households for heating, cooling, and energy crisis assistance will be valued at their actual amount or value at the time they were provided. Purchased fuel, weatherization materials, and other countable tangible items will be valued at their fair market value (the commonly available household rate or cost in the local market area) at the time they were purchased. Installation, replacement, and repair of weatherization materials, and other countable services, will be valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work, by persons of similar skill in this work, in the grantee's or subrecipient's organization in the local area, at the time these services were provided. If the grantee or subrecipient does not have employees performing similar work, the rates will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for similar work, by persons of similar skill in this work, in the same labor market, at the time these services were provided. Fringe benefits and overhead costs will not be counted.</P>

Costs incurred from grantees' own funds to identify, develop, and demonstrate leveraging programs will be deducted in the first base period in which resulting leveraged benefits are provided to low-income households. If there is no resulting leveraged benefit from the expenditure of the grantee's own funds, the grantee's expenditure will not be counted or deducted.</P>

Such costs or charges will be subtracted from the gross value of a counted resource or benefit for low-income households whose benefits are counted, but not for any households whose benefits are not counted.</P>
              <P>(6) Only the amount of the net addition to recipient low-income households' home energy resources may be counted in the valuation of a leveraged resource.</P>

              <P>(8) Grantees must maintain, or have readily available, records sufficient to document leveraged resources and benefits, and offsetting costs and charges, and their valuation. These records must be retained for three years after the end of the base period whose leveraged resources and benefits they document.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Leveraging report.</E> (1) In order to qualify for leveraging incentive funds, each grantee desiring such funds must submit to the Department a report on the leveraged resources provided to low-income households during the preceding base period. These reports must contain the following information in a format established by the Department.</P>
              <P>(i) For each separate leveraged resource, the report must:</P>
              <P>(A) Briefly describe the specific leveraged resource and the specific benefit(s) provided to low-income households by this resource, and state the source of the resource;</P>
              <P>(B) State whether the resource was acquired in cash, as a discount/waiver, or as an in-kind contribution;</P>
              <P>(C) Indicate the geographical area in which the benefit(s) were provided to recipients;</P>
              <P>(D) State the month(s) and year(s) when the benefit(s) were provided to recipients;</P>
              <P>(E) State the gross dollar value of the countable benefits provided by the resource as determined in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, indicate the source(s) of the data used, and describe how the grantee quantified the value and calculated the total amount;</P>
              <P>(F) State the number of low-income households to whom the benefit(s) were provided, and state the eligibility standard(s) for the low-income households to whom the benefit(s) were provided;</P>
              <P>(G) Indicate the agency or agencies that administered the resource/benefit(s); and</P>
              <P>(H) Indicate the criterion or criteria for leveraged resources in paragraph (d)(2) of this section that the resource/benefits meet, and for criteria in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section, explain how resources/benefits valued at $5,000 or more meet the criterion or criteria.</P>
              <P>(ii) State the total gross dollar value of the countable leveraged resources and benefits provided to low-income households during the base period (the sum of the amounts listed pursuant to paragraph (h)(1)(i)(E) of this section).</P>
              <P>(iii) State in dollars any costs incurred by the grantee to leverage resources, and any costs and charges imposed on low-income households to participate in a counted leveraging program or to receive counted leveraged benefits, as determined in accordance with paragraph (g)(5) of this section. Also state the amount of the grantee's regular LIHEAP allotment that the grantee used during the base period specifically to identify, develop, and demonstrate leveraging programs under section 2607A(c)(2) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8626a(c)(2)).</P>
              <P>(iv) State the net dollar value of the countable leveraged resources and benefits for the base period. (Subtract the amounts in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section from the amount in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section.)</P>

              <P>(2) Leveraging reports must be postmarked or hand-delivered not later than November 30 of the fiscal year for which leveraging incentive funds are requested.<PRTPAGE P="659"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The Department may require submission of additional documentation and/or clarification as it determines necessary to verify information in a grantee's leveraging report, to determine whether a leveraged resource is countable, and/or to determine the net valuation of a resource. In such cases, the Department will set a date by which it must receive information sufficient to document countability and/or valuation. In such cases, if the Department does not receive information that it considers sufficient to document countability and/or valuation by the date it has set, then the Department will not count the resource (or portion of resource) in question.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Determination of grantee shares of leveraging incentive funds.</E> Allocation of leveraging incentive funds to grantees will be computed according to a formula using the following factors and weights:</P>
              <P>(1) Fifty (50) percent based on the final net value of countable leveraged resources provided to low-income households during the base period by a grantee relative to its net Federal allotment of funds allocated under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) during the base period, as a proportion of the final net value of the countable leveraged resources provided by all grantees during the base period relative to their net Federal allotment of funds allocated under that section during the base period; and</P>
              <P>(2) Fifty (50) percent based on the final net value of countable leveraged resources provided to low-income households during the base period by a grantee as a proportion of the total final net value of the countable leveraged resources provided by all grantees during the base period; except that: No grantee may receive more than twelve (12.0) percent of the total amount of leveraging incentive funds available for distribution to grantees in any award period; and no grantee may receive more than the smaller of its net Federal allotment of funds allocated under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) during the base period, or two times (double) the final net value of its countable leveraged resources for the base period. The calculations will be based on data contained in the leveraging reports submitted by grantees under paragraph (h) of this section as approved by the Department, and allocation data developed by the Department.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Uses of leveraging incentive funds.</E> (1) Funds awarded to grantees under the leveraging incentive program must be used to increase or maintain heating, cooling, energy crisis, and/or weatherization benefits through (that is, within and as a part of) the grantee's LIHEAP program. These funds can be used for weatherization without regard to the weatherization maximum in section 2605(k) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8624(k)). However, they cannot be counted in the base for calculation of the weatherization maximum for regular LIHEAP funds authorized under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)). Leveraging incentive funds cannot be used for costs of planning and administration. However, in either the award period or the fiscal year following the award period, they can be counted in the base for calculation of maximum grantee planning and administrative costs under section 2605(b)(9) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8624(b)(9)). They cannot be counted in the base for calculation of maximum carryover of regular LIHEAP funds authorized under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)).</P>
              <P>(2) Grantees must include the uses of leveraging incentive funds in their LIHEAP plans (referred to in section 2605(c)(1)(A) of Public Law 97-35) (42 U.S.C. 8624(c)(1)(A)) for the fiscal year in which the grantee obligates these funds. Grantees must document uses of leveraging incentive funds in the same way they document uses of regular LIHEAP funds authorized under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)). Leveraging incentive funds are subject to the same audit requirements as regular LIHEAP funds.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Period of obligation for leveraging incentive funds.</E> Leveraging incentive funds are available for obligation during both the award period and the fiscal year following the award period, without regard to limitations on carryover of funds in section 2607(b)(2)(B) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8626(b)(2)(B)). Any leveraging incentive <PRTPAGE P="660"/>funds not obligated for allowable purposes by the end of this period must be returned to the Department.</P>

              <P>(b) The States are also to expend the Block Grant on primary prevention programs as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Consistent with § 96.125, the State shall expend not less than 20 percent for programs for individuals who do not require treatment for substance abuse, which programs—</P>
              <P>(i) educate and counsel the individuals on such abuse; and</P>

              <P>(ii) ensure that programs receiving priority under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section develop community-based strategies for prevention of such abuse, including strategies to discourage the use of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products by individuals to whom it is unlawful to sell or distribute such beverages or products.</P>
              <P>(c) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, a State is required to expend the Block Grant on women services as follows:</P>

The base shall be calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and the composition of the base shall be applied consistently from year to year. States shall report the methods used to calculate their base for fiscal year 1992 expenditures on treatment for pregnant women and women with dependent children.</P>
              <P>(2) For fiscal year 1994, the State shall, consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, expend not less than five percent of the grant to increase (relative to fiscal year 1993) the availability of such services to pregnant women and women with dependent children.</P>

              <P>(d) Upon the request of a State, the Secretary may waive all or part of the requirement in paragraph (c) of this section if the Secretary determines that the State is providing an adequate level of services for this population. In determining whether an adequate level of services is being provided the Secretary will review the extent to which such individuals are receiving services. This determination may be supported by a combination of criminal justice data, the National Drug and Treatment Units Survey, statewide needs assessment data, waiting list data, welfare department data, including medicaid expenditures, or other State statistical data that are systematically collected. The Secretary will also consider the extent to which the State offers the minimum services required under § 96.124(e). The Secretary shall approve or deny a request for a waiver not later than 120 days after the date on which the request is made. Any waiver provided by the Secretary shall be applicable only to the fiscal year involved.</P>

              <P>(e) With respect to paragraph (c) of this section, the amount set aside for such services shall be expended on individuals who have no other financial means of obtaining such services as provided in § 96.137. All programs providing such services will treat the family as a unit and therefore will admit both women and their children into treatment services, if appropriate. The State shall ensure that, at a minimum, treatment programs receiving funding for such services also provide or arrange for the provision of the following services to pregnant women and women with dependent children, including women who are attempting to regain custody of their children:<PRTPAGE P="669"/>

Information dissemination is characterized by one-way communication from the source to the audience, with limited contact between the two. Examples of activities conducted and methods used for this strategy include (but are not limited to) the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Clearinghouse/information resource center(s);</P>
              <P>(ii) Resource directories;</P>
              <P>(iii) Media campaigns;</P>
              <P>(iv) Brochures;</P>
              <P>(v) Radio/TV public service announcements;</P>
              <P>(vi) Speaking engagements;</P>
              <P>(vii) Health fairs/health promotion; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Information lines.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Education:</E> This strategy involves two-way communication and is distinguished from the Information Dissemination strategy by the fact that interaction between the educator/facilitator and the participants is the basis of its activities. Activities under this strategy aim to affect critical life and social skills, including decision-making, refusal skills, critical analysis (e.g. of media messages) and systematic judgment abilities. Examples of activities conducted and methods used for this strategy include (but are not limited to) the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Classroom and/or small group sessions (all ages);</P>
              <P>(ii) Parenting and family management classes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Peer leader/helper programs;</P>
              <P>(iv) Education programs for youth groups; and</P>
              <P>(v) Children of substance abusers groups.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Alternatives:</E> This strategy provides for the participation of target populations in activities that exclude alcohol, tobacco and other drug use. The assumption is that constructive and healthy activities offset the attraction to, or otherwise meet the needs usually filled by alcohol, tobacco and other drugs and would, therefore, minimize or obviate resort to the latter. Examples of activities conducted and methods used for this strategy include (but are not limited to) the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Drug free dances and parties;</P>
              <P>(ii) Youth/adult leadership activities;<PRTPAGE P="670"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Community drop-in centers; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Community service activities.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Problem Identification and Referral:</E> This strategy aims at identification of those who have indulged in illegal/age-inappropriate use of tobacco or alcohol and those individuals who have indulged in the first use of illicit drugs in order to assess if their behavior can be reversed through education. It should be noted, however, that this strategy does not include any activity designed to determine if a person is in need of treatment. Examples of activities conducted and methods used for this strategy include (but are not limited to) the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Employee assistance programs;</P>
              <P>(ii) Student assistance programs; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Driving while under the influence/driving while intoxicated education programs.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Community-Based Process:</E> This strategy aims to enhance the ability of the community to more effectively provide prevention and treatment services for alcohol, tobacco and drug abuse disorders. Activities in this strategy include organizing, planning, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of services implementation, inter-agency collaboration, coalition building and networking. Examples of activities conducted and methods used for this strategy include (but are not limited to) the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Community and volunteer training, e.g., neighborhood action training, training of key people in the system, staff/officials training;</P>
              <P>(ii) Systematic planning;</P>
              <P>(iii) Multi-agency coordination and collaboration;</P>
              <P>(iv) Accessing services and funding; and</P>
              <P>(v) Community team-building.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Environmental:</E> This strategy establishes or changes written and unwritten community standards, codes and attitudes, thereby influencing incidence and prevalence of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs used in the general population. This strategy is divided into two subcategories to permit distinction between activities which center on legal and regulatory initiatives and those which relate to the service and action-oriented initiatives. Examples of activities conducted and methods used for this strategy shall include (but not be limited to) the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Promoting the establishment and review of alcohol, tobacco and drug use policies in schools;</P>
              <P>(ii) Technical assistance to communities to maximize local enforcement procedures governing availability and distribution of alcohol, tobacco and other drug use;</P>
              <P>(iii) Modifying alcohol and tobacco advertising practices; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Product pricing strategies.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Capacity of treatment for intravenous substance abusers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In order to obtain Block Grant funds, the State must require programs that receive funding under the grant and that treat individuals for intravenous substance abuse to provide to the State, upon reaching 90 percent of its capacity to admit individuals to the program, a notification of that fact within seven days. In carrying out this section, the State shall establish a capacity management program which reasonably implements this section—that is, which enables any such program to readily report to the State when it reaches 90 percent of its capacity—and which ensures the maintenance of a continually updated record of all such reports and which makes excess capacity information available to such programs.</P>
              <P>(b) In order to obtain Block Grant funds, the State shall ensure that each individual who requests and is in need of treatment for intravenous drug abuse is admitted to a program of such treatment not later than—</P>
              <P>(1) 14 days after making the request for admission to such a program; or</P>
              <P>(2) 120 days after the date of such request, if no such program has the capacity to admit the individual on the date of such request and if interim services, including referral for prenatal care, are made available to the individual not later than 48 hours after such request.</P>

              <P>(c) In carrying out subsection (b), the State shall establish a waiting list management program which provides systematic reporting of treatment demand. The State shall require that any program receiving funding from the <PRTPAGE P="671"/>grant, for the purposes of treating injecting drug abusers, establish a waiting list that includes a unique patient identifier for each injecting drug abuser seeking treatment including those receiving interim services, while awaiting admission to such treatment. For individuals who cannot be placed in comprehensive treatment within 14 days, the State shall ensure that the program provide such individuals interim services as defined in § 96.121 and ensure that the programs develop a mechanism for maintaining contact with the individuals awaiting admission. The States shall also ensure that the programs consult the capacity management system as provided in paragraph (a) of this section so that patients on waiting lists are admitted at the earliest possible time to a program providing such treatment within reasonable geographic area.</P>
              <P>(d) In carrying out paragraph (b)(2) of this section the State shall ensure that all individuals who request treatment and who can not be placed in comprehensive treatment within 14 days, are enrolled in interim services and those who remain active on a waiting list in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, are admitted to a treatment program within 120 days. If a person cannot be located for admission into treatment or, if a person refuses treatment, such persons may be taken off the waiting list and need not be provided treatment within 120 days. For example, if such persons request treatment later, and space is not available, they are to be provided interim services, placed on a waiting list and admitted to a treatment program within 120 days from the latter request.</P>
              <P>(e) The State shall require that any entity that receives funding for treatment services for intravenous drug abuse carry out activities to encourage individuals in need of such treatment to undergo such treatment. The States shall require such entities to use outreach models that are scientifically sound, or if no such models are available which are applicable to the local situation, to use an approach which reasonably can be expected to be an effective outreach method. The model shall require that outreach efforts include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Selecting, training and supervising outreach workers;</P>
              <P>(2) Contacting, communicating and following-up with high risk substance abusers, their associates, and neighborhood residents, within the constraints of Federal and State confidentiality requirements, including 42 CFR part 2;</P>
              <P>(3) Promoting awareness among injecting drug abusers about the relationship between injecting drug abuse and communicable diseases such as HIV;</P>
              <P>(4) Recommend steps that can be taken to ensure that HIV transmission does not occur; and</P>
              <P>(5) Encouraging entry into treatment.</P>
              <P>(f) The State shall develop effective strategies for monitoring programs compliance with this section. States shall report under the requirements of § 96.122(g) on the specific strategies to be used to identify compliance problems and corrective actions to be taken to address those problems.</P>

              <P>(a) States shall require any entity receiving amounts from the grant for operating a program of treatment for substance abuse to follow procedures developed by the principal agency of a State for substance abuse, in consultation with the State Medical Director for Substance Abuse Services, and in cooperation with the State Department of Health/Tuberculosis Control Officer, which address how the program—</P>
              <P>(1) Will, directly or through arrangements with other public or nonprofit private entities, routinely make available tuberculosis services as defined in § 96.121 to each individual receiving treatment for such abuse;</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of an individual in need of such treatment who is denied admission to the program on the basis of the lack of the capacity of the program to admit the individual, will refer the individual to another provider of tuberculosis services; and</P>

              <P>(3) Will implement infection control procedures established by the principal agency of a State for substance abuse, in cooperation with the State Department of Health/Tuberculosis Control Officer, which are designed to prevent <PRTPAGE P="672"/>the transmission of tuberculosis, including the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Screening of patients;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identification of those individuals who are at high risk of becoming infected; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Meeting all State reporting requirements while adhering to Federal and State confidentiality requirements, including 42 CFR part 2; and</P>
              <P>(4) will conduct case management activities to ensure that individuals receive such services.</P>
              <P>(b) The State shall develop effective strategies for monitoring programs compliance with this section. States shall report under the requirements of § 96.122(g) on the specific strategies to be used to identify compliance problems and corrective actions to be taken to address those problems. The principal agency, in cooperation with the State Department of Health/Tuberculosis Control Officer, shall also establish linkages with other health care providers to ensure that tuberculosis services are routinely made available. All individuals identified with active tuberculosis shall be reported to the appropriate State official as required by law and consistent with paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) With respect to services provided for by a State for purposes of compliance with this section, the State shall maintain Statewide expenditures of non-Federal amounts for such services at a level that is not less than an average level of such expenditures maintained by the State for the 2-year period preceding the first fiscal year for which the State receives such a grant. In making this determination, States shall establish a reasonable funding base for fiscal year 1993. The base shall be calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and the composition of the base shall be applied consistently from year to year.</P>

              <P>(a) In the case of a designated State as described in paragraph (b) of this section, the State shall do the following—</P>
              <P>(1) with respect to individuals undergoing treatment for substance abuse, the State shall, subject to paragraph (c) of this section, carry out one or more projects to make available to the individuals early intervention services for HIV disease as defined in § 96.121 at the sites at which the individuals are undergoing such treatment;</P>
              <P>(2) for the purpose of providing such early intervention services through such projects, the State shall make available from the grant the amounts prescribed by section 1924 of the PHS Act;</P>
              <P>(3) the State shall, subject to paragraph (d) of this section, carry out such projects only in geographic areas of the State that have the greatest need for the projects;</P>
              <P>(4) the State shall require programs participating in the project to establish linkages with a comprehensive community resource network of related health and social services organizations to ensure a wide-based knowledge of the availability of these services; and</P>
              <P>(5) the State shall require any entity receiving amounts from the Block Grant for operating a substance abuse treatment program to follow procedures developed by the principal agency of a State for substance abuse, in consultation with the State Medical Director for Substance Abuse Services, and in cooperation with the State Department of Health/Communicable Disease Officer.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of this section, a “designated State” is any State whose rate of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is 10 or more such cases per 100,000 individuals (as indicated by the number of such cases reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control for the most recent calendar year for which the data are available).</P>

              <P>(c) With respect to programs that provide treatment services for substance abuse, the State shall ensure that each such program participating in a project under paragraph (a) of this section will be a program that began operation prior to the fiscal year for which the State is applying to receive the grant. A program that so began operation may participate in a project under paragraph (a) of this section without regard to whether the program <PRTPAGE P="673"/>has been providing early intervention services for HIV disease.</P>
              <P>(d) If the State plans to carry out 2 or more projects under paragraph (a) of this section, the State shall carry out one such project in a rural area of the State, unless the requirement is waived. The Secretary shall waive the requirement if the State certifies to the Secretary that:</P>
              <P>(1) The rate of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is less than or equal to two such cases per 100,000 individuals in any rural area of the State, or there are so few infected persons that establishing a project in the area is not reasonable; or</P>
              <P>(2) There are no rural areas in the State as defined in § 96.121.</P>
              <P>(e) With respect to the provision of early intervention services for HIV disease to an individual, the State shall ensure that the entities comply with § 96.137 regarding payment and § 96.135 regarding restrictions on expenditure of grant. The State shall also ensure that such services will be undertaken voluntarily by, and with the informed consent of, the individual, and undergoing such services will not be required as a condition of receiving treatment services for substance abuse or any other services.</P>
              <P>(f) With respect to services provided for a State for purposes of compliance with this section, the State shall maintain Statewide expenditures of non-Federal amounts for such services at a level that is not less than the average level of such expenditures maintained by the State for 2-year period preceding the first fiscal year for which the State receives such a grant.

              <P>(a) The State shall establish and provide for the ongoing operation of a revolving fund as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The purpose of the fund is to make loans for the costs of establishing programs for the provision of housing in which individuals recovering from alcohol and drug abuse may reside in groups of not less than six individuals;</P>
              <P>(2) Not less than $100,000 will be available for the revolving fund;</P>
              <P>(3) Loans made from the revolving fund do not exceed $4,000 and that each such loan is repaid to the revolving fund not later than 2 years after the date on which the loan is made;</P>
              <P>(4) Each such loan is repaid by such residents through monthly installments by the date specified in the loan agreement involved;</P>
              <P>(5) Such loans are made only to nonprofit private entities agreeing that, in the operation of the program established pursuant to the loan—</P>
              <P>(i) The use of alcohol or any illegal drug in the housing provided by the program will be prohibited;</P>
              <P>(ii) Any resident of the housing who violates such prohibition will be expelled from the housing;</P>
              <P>(iii) The costs of the housing, including fees for rent and utilities, will be paid by the residents of the housing; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The residents of the housing will, through a majority vote of the residents, otherwise establish policies governing residence in the housing, including the manner in which applications for residence in the housing are approved;</P>
              <P>(6) States shall identify and clearly define legitimate purposes for which the funds will be spent, such as first month's rent, necessary furniture (e.g., beds), facility modifications (e.g., conversion of basement into a game room or extra bedrooms), and purchase of amenities which foster healthy group living (e.g., dishwasher);</P>
              <P>(7) In managing the revolving fund, the State and the financial entity managing the fund for the State shall abide by all Federal, State and local laws and regulations;</P>

              <P>(8) If the State decides to indirectly manage the fund using a private nonprofit entity as the fund management group, the State shall establish reasonable criteria for selecting the group, such as qualifications, expertise, experience, and capabilities of the group, and the State shall require that these <PRTPAGE P="674"/>entities abide by all Federal, State and local laws and regulations;</P>
              <P>(9) The State may seek assistance to approve or deny applications from entities that meet State-established criteria;</P>
              <P>(10) The State shall set reasonable criteria in determining the eligibility of prospective borrowers such as qualifications, expertise, capabilities, the acceptability of a proposed plan to use the funds and operate the house, and an assessment of the potential borrower's ability to pay back the funds;</P>
              <P>(11) The State shall establish a procedure and process for applying for a loan under the program which may include completion of the application, personal interviews and submission of evidence to support eligibility requirements, as well as establish a written procedure for repayment which will set forth reasonable penalties for late or missed payments and liability and recourse for default;</P>
              <P>(12) The State shall provide clearly defined written instructions to applicants which lays out timeliness, milestones, required documentation, notification of reasonable penalties for late or missed payments and recourse for default, notification on legitimate purposes for which the loan may be spent, and other procedures required by the State; and</P>
              <P>(13) The State shall keep a written record of the number of loans and amount of loans provided, the identities of borrowers and the repayment history of each borrower and retain it for three years.</P>
              <P>(b) The requirements established in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to any territory of the United States other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</P>

              <SUBJECT>State law regarding sale of tobacco products to individuals under age of 18.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For purposes of this section, the term “first applicable fiscal year” means fiscal year 1994, except in the case of any State described in section 1926(a)(2) of the PHS Act, in which case “first applicable fiscal year” means fiscal year 1995. The term “outlet” is any location which sells at retail or otherwise distributes tobacco products to consumers including (but not limited to) locations that sell such products over-the-counter or through vending machines.</P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary may make a grant to a State only if the State, for the first applicable fiscal year and subsequent fiscal years, has in effect a law providing that it is unlawful for any manufacturer, retailer, or distributor of tobacco products to sell or distribute any such product to any individual under age 18 through any sales or distribution outlet, including over-the-counter and vending machine sales.</P>
              <P>(c) For the first and second applicable fiscal years, the State shall, at a minimum, conduct annually a reasonable number of random, unannounced inspections of outlets to ensure compliance with the law and plan and begin to implement any other actions which the State believes are necessary to enforce the law.</P>
              <P>(d) For the third and subsequent fiscal years, the States shall do the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The State shall conduct annual, random, unannounced inspections of both over-the-counter and vending machine outlets. The random inspections shall cover a range of outlets (not preselected on the basis of prior violations) to measure overall levels of compliance as well as to identify violations.</P>
              <P>(2) Random, unannounced inspections shall be conducted annually to ensure compliance with the law and shall be conducted in such a way as to provide a probability sample of outlets. The sample must reflect the distribution of the population under age 18 throughout the State and the distribution of the outlets throughout the State accessible to youth.</P>
              <P>(e) As provided by § 96.122(d), the State shall annually submit to the Secretary a report which shall include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) a detailed description of the State's activities to enforce the law required in paragraph (b) of this section during the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which that State is seeking the grant;</P>

              <P>(2) a detailed description regarding the overall success the State has achieved during the previous fiscal <PRTPAGE P="675"/>year in reducing the availability of tobacco products to individuals under the age of 18, including the results of the unannounced inspections as provided by paragraph (d) of this section for which the results of over-the-counter and vending machine outlet inspections shall be reported separately;</P>
              <P>(3) a detailed description of how the unannounced inspections were conducted and the methods used to identify outlets;</P>
              <P>(4) the strategies to be utilized by the State for enforcing such law during the fiscal year for which the grant is sought; and</P>
              <P>(5) the identity of the agency or agencies designated by the Governor to be responsible for the implementation of the requirements of section 1926 of the PHS Act.</P>
              <P>(f) Beginning in the second applicable fiscal year, the annual report required under paragraph (e) of this section shall be made public within the State, along with the State plan as provided in section 1941 of the PHS Act.</P>
              <P>(g) Beginning with applications for the fourth applicable fiscal year and all subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary will negotiate with the State, as part of the State's plan, the interim performance target the State will meet for that fiscal year and in subsequent years will seek evidence of progress toward achieving or surpassing a performance objective in which the inspection failure rate would be no more than 20% within several years.</P>
              <P>(h) Beginning with the second applicable fiscal year and all subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary shall make a determination, before making a Block Grant to a State for that fiscal year, whether the State reasonably enforced its law in the previous fiscal year pursuant to this section. In making this determination, the Secretary will consider the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) During the first and second applicable fiscal years, the State must conduct the activities prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) During the third applicable fiscal year, the State must conduct random, unannounced inspections in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) During the fourth and all subsequent applicable fiscal years, the State must do the following:</P>
              <P>(i) conduct random, unannounced inspections in accordance with paragraph (d); and</P>
              <P>(ii) except as provided by paragraph (h)(4) of this section, the State must be in substantial compliance with the target negotiated with the Secretary under paragraph (g) of this section for that fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(4) If a State has not substantially complied with the target as prescribed under paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary, in extraordinary circumstances, may consider a number of factors, including survey data showing that the State is making significant progress toward reducing use of tobacco products by children and youth, data showing that the State has progressively decreased the availability of tobacco products to minors, the composition of the outlets inspected as to whether they were over-the-counter or vending machine outlets, and the State's plan for improving the enforcement of the law in the next fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(i) If, after notice to the State and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary determines under paragraph (h) of this section that the State has not maintained compliance, the Secretary will reduce the amount of the allotment in such amounts as is required by section 1926(c) of the PHS Act.</P>
              <P>(j) States may not use the Block Grant to fund the enforcement of their statute, except that they may expend funds from the primary prevention setaside of their Block Grant allotment under 45 CFR 96.124(b)(1) for carrying out the administrative aspects of the requirements such as the development of the sample design and the conducting of the inspections.</P>

              <P>(2) Pregnant substance abusers;</P>
              <P>(3) Injecting drug users; and</P>
              <P>(4) All others.</P>
              <P>(b) The State will, in carrying out this provision publicize the availability to such women of services from the facilities and the fact that pregnant women receive such preference. This may be done by means of street outreach programs, ongoing public service announcements (radio/television), regular advertisements in local/regional print media, posters placed in targeted areas, and frequent notification of availability of such treatment distributed to the network of community based organizations, health care providers, and social service agencies.</P>
              <P>(c) The State shall in carrying out paragraph (a) of this section require that, in the event that a treatment facility has insufficient capacity to provide treatment services to any such pregnant woman who seeks the services from the facility, the facility refer the woman to the State. This may be accomplished by establishing a capacity management program, utilizing a toll-free number, an automated reporting system and/or other mechanisms to ensure that pregnant women in need of such services are referred as appropriate. The State shall maintain a continually updated system to identify treatment capacity for any such pregnant women and will establish a mechanism for matching the women in need of such services with a treatment facility that has the capacity to treat the woman.</P>
              <P>(d) The State, in the case of each pregnant woman for whom a referral under paragraph (a) of this section is made to the State—</P>
              <P>(1) will refer the woman to a treatment facility that has the capacity to provide treatment services to the woman; or</P>
              <P>(2) will, if no treatment facility has the capacity to admit the woman, make available interim services, including a referral for prenatal care, available to the woman not later than 48 hours after the woman seeks the treatment services.</P>
              <P>(e) Procedures for the implementation of this section shall be developed in consultation with the State Medical Director for Substance Abuse Services.</P>
              <P>(f) The State shall develop effective strategies for monitoring programs compliance with this section. States shall report under the requirements of § 96.122(g) on the specific strategies to be used to identify compliance problems and corrective actions to be taken to address those problems.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Additional agreements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) With respect to individuals seeking treatment services, the State is required to improve (relative to fiscal year 1992) the process in the State for referring the individuals to treatment facilities that can provide to the individuals the treatment modality that is most appropriate for the individuals. Examples of how this may be accomplished include the development and implementation of a capacity management/waiting list management system; the utilization of a toll-free number for programs to report available capacity and waiting list data; and the utilization of standardized assessment procedures that facilitate the referral process.</P>
              <P>(b) With respect to any facility for treatment services or prevention activities that is receiving amounts from a Block Grant, continuing education in such services or activities (or both, as the case may be) shall be made available to employees of the facility who provide the services or activities. The States will ensure that such programs include a provision for continuing education for employees of the facility in its funding agreement.</P>

              <P>(c) The State shall coordinate prevention and treatment activities with the provision of other appropriate services (including health, social, correctional and criminal justice, educational, vocational rehabilitation, and <PRTPAGE P="677"/>employment services). In evaluating compliance with this section, the Secretary will consider such factors as the existence of memoranda of understanding between various service providers/agencies and evidence that the State has included prevention and treatment services coordination in its grants and contracts.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon the request of a State, the Secretary may provide to a State a waiver of any or all of the requirements established in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section, if the Secretary determines that, with respect to services for the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, the requirement involved is unnecessary for maintaining quality in the provision of such services in the State. In evaluating whether to grant or deny a waiver, the Secretary will rely on information drawn from the independent peer review/quality assurance activities conducted by the State. For example, a State may be eligible for a waiver of the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section if a State already has a well developed process for referring individuals to treatment facilities that can provide to the individuals the treatment modality that is most appropriate for the individuals. The Secretary will approve or deny a request for a waiver not later than 120 days after the date on which the request is made. Any waiver provided by the Secretary for paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section, will be applicable only to the fiscal year involved.</P>
              <P>(e) The State is also required to have in effect a system to protect from inappropriate disclosure patient records maintained by the State in connection with an activity funded under the program involved or by any entity which is receiving amounts from the grant and such system shall be in compliance with all applicable State and Federal laws and regulations, including 42 CFR part 2. This system shall include provisions for employee education on the confidentiality requirements and the fact that disciplinary action may occur upon inappropriate disclosures. This requirement cannot be waived.</P>

              <P>(a) The State is required to submit to the Secretary an assessment of the need in the State for authorized activities, both by locality and by the State in general. The State is to provide a broad range of information which includes the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The State is to submit data which shows the incidence and prevalence in the State of drug abuse and the incidence and prevalence in the State of alcohol abuse and alcoholism. For fiscal years 1993 through 1996, the State shall submit its best available data on the incidence and prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse and alcoholism. The State shall also provide a summary describing the weakness and bias in the data and a description on how the State plans to strengthen the data in the future.</P>
              <P>(2) The State shall provide a description on current substance abuse prevention and treatment activities:</P>
              <P>(i) For fiscal year 1993, the State shall provide its best available data on current prevention and treatment activities in the State in such detail as it finds reasonably practicable given its own data collection activities and records.</P>

              <P>(ii) For fiscal year 1994 and subsequent years, the State shall provide a detailed description on current prevention and treatment activities in the State. This report shall include a detailed description of the intended use of the funds relating to prevention and treatment, as well as a description of treatment capacity. As to primary prevention activities, the activities must be broken down by strategies used, such as those provided in section 96.125, including the specific activities conducted. The State shall provide the following data if available: the specific risk factors being addressed by activity; the age, race/ethnicity and gender of the population being targeted by the prevention activity; and the community size and type where the activity is carried out. As to all treatment and prevention activities, including primary prevention, the State shall provide the identities of the entities that provide the services and describe the <PRTPAGE P="678"/>services provided. The State shall submit information on treatment utilization to describe the type of care and the utilization according to primary diagnosis of alcohol or drug abuse, or a dual diagnosis of drug and alcohol abuse.</P>
              <P>(3) The State may describe the need for technical assistance to carry out Block Grant activities, including activities relating to the collection of incidence and prevalence data identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The State shall establish goals and objectives for improving substance abuse treatment and prevention activities and shall report activities taken in support of these goals and objectives in its application.</P>
              <P>(5) The State shall submit a detailed description on the extent to which the availability of prevention and treatment activities is insufficient to meet the need for the activities, the interim services to be made available under sections 96.126 and 96.131, and the manner in which such services are to be so available. Special attention should be provided to the following groups:</P>
              <P>(i) Pregnant addicts;</P>
              <P>(ii) Women who are addicted and who have dependent children;</P>
              <P>(iii) Injecting drug addicts; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Substance abusers infected with HIV or who have tuberculosis.</P>
              <P>(6) Documentation describing the results of the State's management information system pertaining to capacity and waiting lists shall also be submitted, as well as a summary of such information for admissions and, when available, discharges. As to prevention activities, the report shall include a description of the populations at risk of becoming substance abusers.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Maintenance of effort regarding State expenditures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) With respect to the principal agency of a State for carrying out authorized activities, the agency shall for each fiscal year maintain aggregate State expenditures by the principal agency for authorized activities at a level that is not less than the average level of such expenditures maintained by the State for the two year period preceding the fiscal year for which the State is applying for the grant. The Block Grant shall not be used to supplant State funding of alcohol and other drug prevention and treatment programs.</P>
              <P>(b) Upon the request of a State, the Secretary may waive all or part of the requirement established in paragraph (a) of this section if the Secretary determines that extraordinary economic conditions in the State justify the waiver. The State involved must submit information sufficient for the Secretary to make the determination, including the nature of the extraordinary economic circumstances, documented evidence and appropriate data to support the claim, and documentation on the year for which the State seeks the waiver. The Secretary will approve or deny a request for a waiver not later than 120 days after the date on which the request is made. Any waiver provided by the Secretary shall be applicable only to the fiscal year involved. “Extraordinary economic conditions” mean a financial crisis in which the total tax revenue declines at least one and one-half percent, and either unemployment increases by at least one percentage point, or employment declines by at least one and one-half percent.</P>
              <P>(c) In making a Block Grant to a State for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall make a determination of whether, for the previous fiscal year or years, the State maintained material compliance with any agreement made under paragraph (a) of this section. If the Secretary determines that a State has failed to maintain such compliance, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the allotment for the State for the fiscal year for which the grant is being made by an amount equal to the amount constituting such failure for the previous fiscal year.</P>

              <P>(d) The Secretary may make a Block Grant for a fiscal year only if the State involved submits to the Secretary information sufficient for the Secretary to make the determination required in paragraph (a) of this section, which includes the dollar amount reflecting the aggregate State expenditures by the principal agency for authorized activities for the two State fiscal years preceding the fiscal year for which the State is applying for the grant. The <PRTPAGE P="679"/>base shall be calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and the composition of the base shall be applied consistently from year to year.</P>

              <P>(6) To provide individuals with hypodermic needles or syringes so that such individuals may use illegal drugs, unless the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service determines that a demonstration needle exchange program would be effective in reducing drug abuse and the risk that the public will become infected with the etiologic agent for AIDS.</P>
              <P>(b) The State shall limit expenditures on the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The State involved will not expend more than 5 percent of the grant to pay the costs of administering the grant; and</P>
              <P>(2) The State will not, in expending the grant for the purpose of providing treatment services in penal or correctional institutions of the State, expend more than an amount prescribed by section 1931(a)(3) of the PHS Act.</P>

              <P>(i) The daily rate of payment provided to the hospital for providing the services to the individual will not exceed the comparable daily rate provided for community-based, nonhospital, residential programs of treatment for substance abuse; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The grant may be expended for such services only to the extent that it is medically necessary, i.e., only for those days that the patient cannot be safely treated in a residential, community-based program.</P>
              <P>(d) The Secretary may approve a waiver for construction under paragraph (a)(3) of this section within 120 days after the date of a request only if:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Independent peer review.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The State shall for the fiscal year for which the grant is provided, provide for independent peer review to assess the quality, appropriateness, and efficacy of treatment services provided in the State to individuals under the program involved, and ensure that at least 5 percent of the entities providing services in the State under such program are reviewed. The programs reviewed shall be representative of the total population of such entities.</P>

              <P>(b) The purpose of independent peer review is to review the quality and appropriateness of treatment services. The review will focus on treatment programs and the substance abuse service system rather than on the individual practitioners. The intent of the independent peer review process is to continuously improve the treatment services to alcohol and drug abusers within the State system. “Quality,” for purposes of this section, is the provision of treatment services which, within the constraints of technology, resources, and patient/client circumstances, will meet accepted standards and practices which will improve patient/client health and safety status in the context of recovery. “Appropriateness,” for purposes of this section, means the provision of treatment <PRTPAGE P="681"/>services consistent with the individual's identified clinical needs and level of functioning.</P>
              <P>(c) The independent peer reviewers shall be individuals with expertise in the field of alcohol and drug abuse treatment. Because treatment services may be provided by multiple disciplines, States will make every effort to ensure that individual peer reviewers are representative of the various disciplines utilized by the program under review. Individual peer reviewers must also be knowledgeable about the modality being reviewed and its underlying theoretical approach to addictions treatment, and must be sensitive to the cultural and environmental issues that may influence the quality of the services provided.</P>
              <P>(d) As part of the independent peer review, the reviewers shall review a representative sample of patient/client records to determine quality and appropriateness of treatment services, while adhering to all Federal and State confidentiality requirements, including 42 CFR part 2. The reviewers shall examine the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Admission criteria/intake process;</P>
              <P>(2) Assessments;</P>
              <P>(3) Treatment planning, including appropriate referral, e.g., prenatal care and tuberculosis and HIV services;</P>
              <P>(4) Documentation of implementation of treatment services;</P>
              <P>(5) Discharge and continuing care planning; and</P>
              <P>(6) Indications of treatment outcomes.</P>
              <P>(e) The State shall ensure that the independent peer review will not involve practitioners/providers reviewing their own programs, or programs in which they have administrative oversight, and that there be a separation of peer review personnel from funding decisionmakers. In addition, the State shall ensure that independent peer review is not conducted as part of the licensing/certification process.</P>
              <P>(f) The States shall develop procedures for the implementation of this section and such procedures shall be developed in consultation with the State Medical Director for Substance Abuse Services.</P>

              <P>(1) Collect reimbursement for the costs of providing such services to persons who are entitled to insurance benefits under the Social Security Act, including programs under title XVIII and title XIX, any State compensation program, any other public assistance program for medical expenses, any grant program, any private health insurance, or any other benefit program; and</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 96—SSBG Reporting Form and Instructions</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Instructions</HD>
              <P>This form must be used by states as the reporting instrument to satisfy the requirements of 45 CFR 96.74(a) (1) through (4). Following are instructions on how to complete the form:</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">General</HD>
              <P>1. Enter the name of the state submitting the form.</P>
              <P>2. Enter the fiscal year for which the form is being submitted. Either the state or federal fiscal year may be used.</P>
              <P>3. Enter the month and year of the beginning and end of the fiscal year—e.g., 07/91 to 06/92.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Services</HD>
              <P>4. The “service” column contains a list of services that are to be used for national reporting. This list in no way mandates how a state is to design its program of services under the SSBG, but rather is to be used only to obtain nationally comparable statistics. If the services that your state provides reasonably fit the uniform service definitions in appendix A, use them. In cases where no fit is possible between the state services and the services on the form, use item number 29—the other services category. Please list all services reported under item 29, using a separate sheet if necessary. The state's definition of these services must appear in the state's annual report.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Recipient Data</HD>
              <P>In reporting the following data:<PRTPAGE P="686"/>
              </P>
              <P>• Each state should use its own definitions of the terms “adult” and “child.” These definitions should be described elsewhere in the annual report. If the definitions of adult and child vary by services, all such definitions must be included.</P>
              <P>• States should, if possible, consider as the “recipient” of the service the individual to whom the service is provided. This means that the child would be considered the recipient of child day care services, even if such services are provided to allow the child's adult caretaker to pursue employment. Similarly, an adult who receives counseling services should be considered as the recipient of that service, even if the service is provided as part of a child's protective services plan. In cases where each member of a family, for example, receives an individual service such as counseling, each family member should be considered as a separate recipient.</P>
              <P>• States should, if possible, consider as a service, i.e., a count of one, any service provided to a single recipient for the duration of the reporting period (one year), or any fraction thereof. In cases where an individual received a service during the reporting period, then discontinued the service, and then received the service again, the individual should only be counted once, if possible.</P>
              <P>• The criteria applied in determining eligibility for each service—such as income eligibility guidelines, sliding fee scales, the effect of public assistance benefits, and any requirements for enrollment in school or training programs—should be described elsewhere in the annual report.</P>
              <P>5. Under “Number of Recipients—Adults” enter the number of adults who have received each service funded in whole or part under the SSBG.</P>
              <P>6. Under “Number of Recipients—Children” enter the number of children who have received each service funded in whole or part under the SSBG.</P>
              <P>7. Under “Number of Recipients—Total” enter the total number of recipients of each service. This should be the sum of the adults and children reported in the preceding “adult” and “children” columns.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Expenditure Data</HD>
              <P>8. Under “Expenditures—Total $” enter all funds that the state expends on each service. This should include SSBG funds as well as funds from other federal sources, state funds, and local funds. A listing of the sources of these funds, and the amounts allocated, should appear elsewhere in the annual report.</P>
              <P>9. Under “Expenditures—SSBG $” enter the total SSBG funds expended for each service. This column should be totaled, and the sum placed at the bottom of the column in the “Totals” box.</P>
              <P>10. Under “Expenditures—Per Adult” enter the average amount of SSBG funds expended on each adult recipient of each service.</P>
              <P>11. Under “Expenditures—Per Child” enter the average amount of SSBG funds expended on each child recipient of each service.</P>
              <P>12. Item 30 in the “Total SSBG $” column should contain other expenditures and income as follows:</P>
              <P>a. “Transfers In” should contain funds transferred from other federal block grants to the SSBG program. A listing of the source(s) of block grant funds and their amounts should appear elsewhere in the annual report.</P>
              <P>b. “Transfers Out” should show funds transferred from the SSBG program to other federal block grants. A listing of the program(s) to which SSBG funds were transferred, and the amounts, should appear elsewhere in the annual report.</P>
              <P>c. “Carry Forward” should show funds the state intends to carry over from the reporting fiscal year to the following fiscal year. The SSBG statute permits states two years to expend SSBG funds.</P>
              <P>d. “Carry Over” should show funds carried from a previous fiscal year into the current reporting year.</P>
              <P>e. “Administrative Costs” should show all other non-service use of SSBG funds—e.g., funds expended for training, licensing activities, or overhead costs.</P>
              <P>f. This column should be totaled, and the sum placed at the bottom of the column in the “Totals” box.</P>
              <P>13. Under “Provisions Method—Public/Private” enter a check mark on “X” in the appropriate column(s) to indicate whether a service was provided by public agencies or private agencies. In some cases, a given service may have been provided by both methods, in which case both columns would be checked for that service.</P>
              <P>14. Enter the name, title, and telephone number of a contact person who can answer questions about the data.</P>
              <P>15. Code Column:</P>

              <P>Six of the columns on this form have a “C” column to the right of them. These are “Code” columns to permit a state to indicate, for expenditure data, whether each cell of data is A (actual), E (estimated), or S (sampled), and for recipient data, whether the data is based on an unduplicated (U) or duplicated (D) count of recipients. These codes will permit the Department to determine the relative degree of statistical validity of the data. Actual recipient counts and expenditure amounts must be used when available. If actual counts are not available, sampling and/or estimating may be used to derive the numbers in this report. A description of the sampling and/or estimation methods used to derive any data must appear elsewhere in the annual report.<PRTPAGE P="687"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Report Submission Using PC Diskettes</HD>
              <P>States with personal computer (PC) equipment may submit this data using PC diskettes in addition to the hardcopy form which will be included in the complete annual report. Diskettes may be either 5<FR>1/4</FR>″ or 3<FR>1/2</FR>″; data may be submitted using Lotus 1-2-3, Quattro Pro, DBase III or IV, Wordstar, Word Perfect, or ASCII formats. Use of Lotus 1-2-3 is preferred, but any of the other formats listed may be used. If a state wishes to use a format other than one listed here, please call Bryant Tudor on (202) 401-5535 or Frank Burns on (202) 401-5536, or write to the Office of Community Services, Administration for Children and Families, Fourth Floor—East Wing, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., Washington, DC 10447. Use of diskettes can greatly reduce transcription errors and also facilitate processing of the data once received. We anticipate that many states will want to avail themselves of this method of reporting.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does an insular area apply for a consolidated grant?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An insular area may apply for a consolidated grant in lieu of filing an individual application for any of the programs listed in § 97.12 for which the insular area is eligible.</P>
            <P>(b) The chief executive officer or his designee may submit a consolidated grant application at any time prior to expenditure of the funds proposed for consolidation. The application must specify the amount of funds proposed for consolidation, the titles of the programs that are the sources of funds that are to be consolidated and the titles of the programs under whose statutory authority the funds are to be expended.</P>
            <P>(c) The application must contain the assurances, certifications, and other information required by the statutes and regulations applicable to those programs under which funds will be expended. If any of the requirements for these latter programs are substantially the same, they may be met by a single assurance, certification, or narrative, as appropriate. The application need not meet the application or other requirements for programs which are sources of funds for the consolidated grant but under whose authority no funds will be expended.</P>
            <P>(d) If after receiving a consolidated grant, an insular area wishes to use funds for a purpose authorized by an eligible program that is not included in the consolidated grant, or by an eligible program that was included in the grant but was not intended as a program under which funds would be expended, the insular area must submit an amended application indicating the proposed change and containing the assurances, certifications and other information applicable to that program.</P>

As long as the amount requested does not exceed the amount for which the insular area is eligible under the programs that are being consolidated, the amount of the award will equal the amount requested in the application.</P>

            <P>Funds awarded under a consolidated grant must be used for purposes authorized by the statutes and regulations of the programs included in the consolidated grant. In its application for a consolidated grant the insular area is to indicate the amount of funds that will be allocated to the eligible programs.</P>

            <P>(b) In regard to programs included in a consolidated grant, an insular area need not comply with any of the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring recipients to match federal funds with their own or other funds.</P>
            <P>(c) A single report may be submitted in lieu of any individual reports that may be required under the programs included in a consolidated grant.</P>

              <P>(6) Administer the CCDF responsibly to ensure that statutory requirements are met and that adequate information regarding the use of public funds is provided;</P>
              <P>(7) Design programs that provide uninterrupted service to families and providers, to the extent allowed under the statute, to support parental education, training, and employment and continuity of care that minimizes disruptions to children's learning and development;</P>
              <P>(8) Provide a progression of training and professional development opportunities for caregivers, teachers, and directors to increase their effectiveness in supporting children's development and learning and strengthen and retain (including through financial incentives and compensation improvements) the child care workforce.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Termination.</E> The Secretary shall terminate approval of a request for a waiver authorized under the Act or this <PRTPAGE P="705"/>section if the Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing based on the rules of procedure in part 99 of this chapter, that the performance of a State, Territory or Tribe granted relief under this section has been inadequate, or if such relief is no longer necessary to achieve its original purposes.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Renewal.</E> The Secretary may approve or disapprove a request from a State, Territory or Tribe for renewal of an existing waiver under the Act or this section for a period no longer than one year.

              <P>(1)(i) Be under 13 years of age; or,</P>
              <P>(ii) At the option of the Lead Agency, be under age 19 and physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself or herself, or under court supervision;</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Reside with a family whose income does not exceed 85 percent of the State's median income (SMI), which must be based on the most recent SMI data that is published by the Bureau of the Census, for a family of the same size; and</P>

              <P>(A) At grantee option, the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be waived for families eligible for child care pursuant to this paragraph, if determined to be necessary on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(B) At grantee option, the waiver provisions in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section apply to children in foster care when defined in the Plan, pursuant to § 98.16(g)(7).</P>
              <P>(b) A grantee or other administering agency may establish eligibility conditions or priority rules in addition to those specified in this section and § 98.46, which shall be described in the Plan pursuant to § 98.16(i)(5), so long as they do not:</P>

              <P>(2) Limit parental rights provided under subpart D of this part;</P>
              <P>(3) Violate the provisions of this section, § 98.46, or the Plan.

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility determination processes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A Lead Agency shall re-determine a child's eligibility for child care services no sooner than 12 months following the initial determination or most recent redetermination, subject to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) During the period of time between determinations or redeterminations, if the child met all of the requirements in § 98.20(a) on the date of the most recent eligibility determination or redetermination, the child shall be considered eligible and will receive services at least at the same level, regardless of:</P>
              <P>(i) A change in family income, if that family income does not exceed 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A temporary change in the ongoing status of the child's parent as working or attending a job training or educational program. A temporary change shall include, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(A) Any time-limited absence from work for an employed parent due to reasons such as need to care for a family member or an illness;;</P>
              <P>(B) Any interruption in work for a seasonal worker who is not working between regular industry work seasons;</P>
              <P>(C) Any student holiday or break for a parent participating in training or education;</P>
              <P>(D) Any reduction in work, training or education hours, as long as the parent is still working or attending training or education;</P>
              <P>(E) Any other cessation of work or attendance at a training or education program that does not exceed three months or a longer period of time established by the Lead Agency;</P>
              <P>(F) Any change in age, including turning 13 years old during the eligibility period; and</P>
              <P>(G) Any change in residency within the State, Territory, or Tribal service area.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Lead Agencies have the option, but are not required, to discontinue assistance due to a parent's loss of work or cessation of attendance at a job training or educational program that does not constitute a temporary change in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. However, if the Lead Agency exercises this option, it must continue assistance at least at the same level for a period of not less than three months after each such loss or cessation in order for the parent to engage in job search and resume work, or resume attendance at a job training or educational activity.</P>
              <P>(ii) At the end of the minimum three-month period of continued assistance, if the parent is engaged in a qualifying work, education, or training activity with income below 85% of SMI, assistance cannot be terminated and the child must continue receiving assistance until the next scheduled re-determination, or at Lead Agency option, for an additional minimum 12—month eligibility period.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a Lead Agency chooses to initially qualify a family for CCDF assistance based a parent's status of seeking employment or engaging in job search, the Lead Agency has the option to end assistance after a minimum of three months if the parent has still not found employment, although assistance must continue if the parent becomes employed during the job search period.</P>
              <P>(3) Lead Agencies cannot increase family co-payment amounts, established in accordance with § 98.45(k), within the minimum 12-month eligibility period except as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(4) Because a child meeting eligibility requirements at the most recent eligibility determination or redetermination is considered eligible between redeterminations as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any payment for such a child shall not be considered an error or improper payment under subpart K of this part due to a change in the family's circumstances.<PRTPAGE P="707"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1), the Lead Agency may discontinue assistance prior to the next re-determination in limited circumstances where there have been:</P>
              <P>(i) Excessive unexplained absences despite multiple attempts by the Lead Agency or designated entity to contact the family and provider, including prior notification of possible discontinuation of assistance;</P>
              <P>(A) If the Lead Agency chooses this option, it shall define the number of unexplained absences that shall be considered excessive;</P>
              <P>(B) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(ii) A change in residency outside of the State, Territory, or Tribal service area; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Substantiated fraud or intentional program violations that invalidate prior determinations of eligibility.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Lead Agencies that establish family income eligibility at a level less than 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size (in order for a child to initially qualify for assistance) must provide a graduated phase-out by implementing two-tiered eligibility thresholds, with the second tier of eligibility (used at the time of eligibility re-determination) set at:</P>
              <P>(i) 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An amount lower than 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size, but above the Lead Agency's initial eligibility threshold, that:</P>
              <P>(A) Takes into account the typical household budget of a low income family; and</P>
              <P>(B) Provides justification that the second eligibility threshold is:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Sufficient to accommodate increases in family income over time that are typical for low-income workers and that promote and support family economic stability; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Reasonably allows a family to continue accessing child care services without unnecessary disruption.</P>
              <P>(2) At re-determination, a child shall be considered eligible (pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section) if their parents, at the time of redetermination, are working or attending a job training or educational program even if their income exceeds the Lead Agency's income limit to initially quality for assistance, as long as their income does not exceed the second tier of the eligibility described in (b)(1);</P>
              <P>(3) A family meeting the conditions described in (b)(2) shall be eligible for services pursuant to the conditions described in § 98.20 and all other paragraphs of § 98.21, with the exception of the co-payment restrictions at § 98.21(a)(3). To help families transition off of child care assistance, Lead Agencies may gradually adjust co-pay amounts for families whose children are determined eligible under the graduate phase-out conditions described in paragraph (b)(2) and may require additional reporting on changes in family income as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, provided such requirements do not constitute an undue burden, pursuant to conditions described in (e)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) The Lead Agency shall establish processes for initial determination and redetermination of eligibility that take into account irregular fluctuation in earnings, including policies that ensure temporary increases in income, including temporary increases that result in monthly income exceeding 85 percent of SMI (calculated on a monthly basis), do not affect eligibility or family co-payments.</P>
              <P>(d) The Lead Agency shall establish procedures and policies to ensure parents, especially parents receiving assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, are not required to unduly disrupt their education, training, or employment in order to complete the eligibility redetermination process.</P>
              <P>(e) The Lead Agency shall specify in the Plan any requirements for parents to notify the Lead Agency of changes in circumstances during the minimum 12-month eligibility period, and describe efforts to ensure such requirements do not place an undue burden on eligible families that could impact continued eligibility between redeterminations.</P>

              <P>(1) The Lead Agency must require families to report a change at any point during the minimum 12-month period, limited to:<PRTPAGE P="708"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) If the family's income exceeds 85% of SMI, taking into account irregular income fluctuations; or</P>
              <P>(ii) At the option of the Lead Agency, the family has experienced a non-temporary cessation of work, training, or education.</P>
              <P>(2) Any additional requirements the Lead Agency chooses, at its option, to impose on parents to provide notification of changes in circumstances to the Lead Agency or entities designated to perform eligibility functions shall not constitute an undue burden on families. Any such requirements shall:</P>

              <P>(i) Limit notification requirements to items that impact a family's eligibility (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> only if income exceeds 85 percent of SMI, or there is a non-temporary change in the status of the child's parent as working or attending a job training or educational program) or those that enable the Lead Agency to contact the family or pay providers;</P>
              <P>(ii) Not require an office visit in order to fulfill notification requirements; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Offer a range of notification options (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> phone, email, online forms, extended submission hours) to accommodate the needs of parents;</P>
              <P>(3) During a period of graduated phase-out, the Lead Agency may require additional reporting on changes in family income in order to gradually adjust family co-payments, if desired, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Lead Agencies must allow families the option to voluntarily report changes on an ongoing basis.</P>
              <P>(i) Lead Agencies are required to act on this information provided by the family if it would reduce the family's co-payment or increase the family's subsidy.</P>
              <P>(ii) Lead Agencies are prohibited from acting on information that would reduce the family's subsidy unless the information provided indicates the family's income exceeds 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size, taking into account irregular income fluctuations, or, at the option of the Lead Agency, the family has experienced a non-temporary change in the work, training, or educational status.</P>
              <P>(f) Lead Agencies must take into consideration children's development and learning and promote continuity of care when authorizing child care services.</P>
              <P>(g) Lead Agencies are not required to limit authorized child care services strictly based on the work, training, or educational schedule of the parent(s) or the number of hours the parent(s) spend in work, training, or educational activities.</P>

              <P>(a) Federal matching funds are available for expenditures in a State based upon the formula specified at § 98.63(a).</P>
              <P>(b) Expenditures in a State under paragraph (a) of this section will be matched at the Federal medical assistance rate for the applicable fiscal year for allowable activities, as described in the approved State Plan, that meet the goals and purposes of the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) In order to receive Federal matching funds for a fiscal year under paragraph (a) of this section:</P>

              <P>(1) States shall also expend an amount of non-Federal funds for child care activities in the State that is at least equal to the State's share of expenditures for fiscal year 1994 or 1995 (whichever is greater) under sections 402(g) and (i) of the Social Security Act <PRTPAGE P="728"/>as these sections were in effect before October 1, 1995; and</P>

              <P>(e) An expenditure in the State for purposes of this subpart may be:</P>
              <P>(1) Public funds when the funds are:</P>
              <P>(i) Appropriated directly to the Lead Agency specified at § 98.10, or transferred from another public agency to that Lead Agency and under its administrative control, or certified by the contributing public agency as representing expenditures eligible for Federal match;</P>
              <P>(ii) Not used to match other Federal funds; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Not Federal funds, or are Federal funds authorized by Federal law to be used to match other Federal funds; or</P>
              <P>(2) Donated from private sources when the donated funds:</P>
              <P>(i) Are donated without any restriction that would require their use for a specific individual, organization, facility or institution;</P>
              <P>(ii) Do not revert to the donor's facility or use;</P>
              <P>(iii) Are not used to match other Federal funds;</P>
              <P>(iv) Shall be certified both by the Lead Agency and by the donor (if funds are donated directly to the Lead Agency) or the Lead Agency and the entity designated by the State to receive donated funds pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section (if funds are donated directly to the designated entity) as available and representing funds eligible for Federal match; and</P>
              <P>(v) Shall be subject to the audit requirements in § 98.65 of these regulations.</P>
              <P>(f) Donated funds need not be transferred to or under the administrative control of the Lead Agency in order to qualify as an expenditure eligible to receive Federal match under this section. They may be given to the public or private entities designated by the State to implement the child care program in accordance with § 98.11 provided that such entities are identified and designated in the State Plan to receive donated funds in accordance with § 98.16(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(g) The following are not counted as an eligible State expenditure under this part:</P>

              <P>(2) Family contributions to the cost of care as required by § 98.45(k).</P>
              <P>(h) Public pre-kindergarten (pre-K) expenditures:</P>
              <P>(1) May be used to meet the maintenance-of-effort requirement only if the State has not reduced its expenditures for full-day/full-year child care services; and</P>
              <P>(2) May be eligible for Federal match if the State includes in its Plan, as provided in § 98.16(w), a description of the efforts it will undertake to ensure that pre-K programs meet the needs of working parents.</P>
              <P>(3) In any fiscal year, a State may use public pre-K funds for up to 20% of the funds serving as maintenance-of-effort under this subsection. In addition, in any fiscal year, a State may use other public pre-K funds as expenditures serving as State matching funds under this subsection; such public pre-K funds used as State expenditures may not exceed 30% of the amount of a State's expenditures required to draw down the State's full allotment of Federal matching funds available under this subsection.</P>
              <P>(4) If applicable, the CCDF Plan shall reflect the State's intent to use public pre-K funds in excess of 10%, but not for more than 20% of its maintenance-of-effort or 30% of its State matching funds in a fiscal year. Also, the Plan shall describe how the State will coordinate its pre-K and child care services to expand the availability of child care.</P>
              <P>(i) Matching funds are subject to the obligation and liquidation requirements at § 98.60(d)(3).</P>

              <P>(a) According to the provisions of this section State and Tribal Discretionary Funds are subject to reallotment, and State Matching Funds are subject to redistribution. State funds are reallotted or redistributed only to States as defined for the original allocation. Tribal funds are reallotted only to Tribes. Funds granted to the Territories are not subject to reallotment. Any funds granted to the Territories that are returned after they have been allotted will revert to the Federal government.</P>
              <P>(b) Any portion of a State's Discretionary Fund allotment that is not required to carry out its Plan, in the period for which the allotment is made available, shall be reallotted to other States in proportion to the original allotments. For purposes of this paragraph the term “State” means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The other Territories and the Tribes may not receive reallotted State Discretionary Funds.</P>
              <P>(1) Each year, the State shall report to the Secretary either the dollar amount from the previous year's grant that it will be unable to obligate by the end of the obligation period or that all funds will be obligated during such time. Such report shall be postmarked by April 1st.</P>
              <P>(2) Based upon the reallotment reports submitted by States, the Secretary will reallot funds.</P>
              <P>(i) If the total amount available for reallotment is $25,000 or more, funds will be reallotted to States in proportion to each State's allotment for the applicable fiscal year's funds, pursuant to § 98.61(a).</P>
              <P>(ii) If the amount available for reallotment is less than $25,000, the Secretary will not reallot any funds, and such funds will revert to the Federal government.</P>

              <P>(iii) If an individual reallotment amount to a State is less than $500, the <PRTPAGE P="734"/>Secretary will not issue the award, and such funds will revert to the Federal government.</P>
              <P>(3) If a State does not submit a reallotment report by the deadline for report submittal, either:</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary will determine that the State does not have any funds available for reallotment; or</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of a report postmarked after April 1st, any funds reported to be available for reallotment shall revert to the Federal government.</P>
              <P>(4) States receiving reallotted funds shall obligate and expend these funds in accordance with § 98.60. The reallotment of funds does not extend the obligation period or the program period for expenditure of such funds.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Any portion of the Matching Fund granted to a State that is not obligated in the period for which the grant is made shall be redistributed. Funds, if any, will be redistributed on the request of, and only to, those other States that have met the requirements of § 98.55(c) in the period for which the grant was first made. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), the term “State” means the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Territorial and tribal grantees may not receive redistributed Matching Funds.</P>
              <P>(2) Matching Funds allotted to a State under § 98.63(a), but not granted, shall also be redistributed in the manner described in paragraph (1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The amount of Matching Funds granted to a State that will be made available for redistribution will be based on the State's financial report to ACF for the Child Care and Development Fund (ACF-696) and is subject to the monetary limits at paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) A State eligible to receive redistributed Matching Funds shall also use the ACF-696 to request its share of the redistributed funds, if any.</P>
              <P>(5) A State's share of redistributed Matching Funds is based on the same ratio as the number of children under 13 residing in the State to the number of children residing in all States eligible to receive and that request the redistributed Matching Funds.</P>
              <P>(6) Redistributed funds are considered part of the grant for the fiscal year in which the redistribution occurs.</P>
              <P>(d) Any portion of a Tribe's allotment of Discretionary Funds that is not required to carry out its Plan, in the period for which the allotment is made available, shall be reallotted to other tribal grantees in proportion to their original allotments. States and Territories may not receive reallotted tribal funds.</P>
              <P>(1) Each year, the Tribe shall report to the Secretary either the dollar amount from the previous year's grant that it will be unable to obligate by the end of the obligation period or that all funds will be obligated during such time. Such report shall be postmarked by a deadline established by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(2) Based upon the reallotment reports submitted by Tribes, the Secretary will reallot Tribal Discretionary Funds among the other Tribes.</P>
              <P>(i) If the total amount available for reallotment is $25,000 or more, funds will be reallotted to other tribal grantees in proportion to each Tribe's original allotment for the applicable fiscal year pursuant to § 98.62(c).</P>
              <P>(ii) If the total amount available for reallotment is less than $25,000, the Secretary will not reallot any funds, and such funds will revert to the Federal government.</P>
              <P>(iii) If an individual reallotment amount to an applicant Tribe is less than $500, the Secretary will not issue the award, and such funds will revert to the Federal government.</P>
              <P>(3) If a Tribe does not submit a reallotment report by the deadline for report submittal, either:</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary will determine that Tribe does not have any funds available for reallotment; or</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of a report received after the deadline established by the Secretary, any funds reported to be available for reallotment shall revert to the Federal government.</P>

              <P>(4) Tribes receiving reallotted funds shall obligate and expend these funds <PRTPAGE P="735"/>in accordance with § 98.60. The reallotment of funds does not extend the obligation period or the program period for expenditure of such funds.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Construction and renovation of child care facilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Upon requesting and receiving approval from the Secretary, Tribal Lead Agencies may use amounts provided under §§ 98.61(c) and 98.62(b) to make payments for construction or major renovation of child care facilities (including paying the cost of amortizing the principal and paying interest on loans).</P>
              <P>(b) To be approved by the Secretary, a request shall be made in accordance with uniform procedures established by program instruction and, in addition, shall demonstrate that:</P>
              <P>(1) Adequate facilities are not otherwise available to enable the Tribal Lead Agency to carry out child care programs;</P>
              <P>(2) The lack of such facilities will inhibit the operation of child care programs in the future; and</P>

              <P>(3) The use of funds for construction or major renovation will not result in a decrease in the level of child care services provided by the Tribal Lead Agency as compared to the level of services provided by the Tribal Lead Agency in the preceding fiscal year. The Secretary shall waive this requirement if:<PRTPAGE P="743"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary determines that the decrease in the level of child care services provided by the Indian tribe or tribal organization is temporary; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Indian tribe or tribal organization submits to the Secretary a plan that demonstrates that after the date on which the construction or renovation is completed:</P>
              <P>(A) The level of direct child care services will increase; or</P>
              <P>(B) The quality of child care services will improve.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Tribal Lead Agency may use CCDF funds for reasonable and necessary planning costs associated with assessing the need for construction or renovation or for preparing a request, in accordance with the uniform procedures established by program instruction, to spend CCDF funds on construction or major renovation.</P>
              <P>(2) A Tribal Lead Agency may only use CCDF funds to pay for the costs of an architect, engineer, or other consultant for a project that is subsequently approved by the Secretary. If the project later fails to gain the Secretary's approval, the Tribal Lead Agency must pay for the architectural, engineering or consultant costs using non-CCDF funds.</P>
              <P>(d) Tribal Lead Agencies that receive approval from the Secretary to use CCDF funds for construction or major renovation shall comply with the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Federal share requirements and use of property requirements at 45 CFR 75.318;</P>

              <P>(7) Any additional requirements established by program instruction, including requirements concerning:</P>
              <P>(i) The recording of a Notice of Federal Interest in the property;</P>
              <P>(ii) Rights and responsibilities in the event of a grantee's default on a mortgage;</P>
              <P>(iii) Insurance and maintenance;</P>
              <P>(iv) Submission of plans, specifications, inspection reports, and other legal documents; and</P>
              <P>(v) Modular units.</P>
              <P>(e) In lieu of obligation and liquidation requirements at § 98.60(e), Tribal Lead Agencies shall liquidate CCDF funds used for construction or major renovation by the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the grant is awarded.</P>
              <P>(f) Tribal Lead Agencies may expend funds, without requesting approval pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, for minor renovation.</P>
              <P>(g) A new tribal grantee (i.e., one that did not receive CCDF funds the preceding fiscal year) may spend no more than an amount equivalent to its Tribal Mandatory allocation on construction and renovation. A new tribal grantee must spend an amount equivalent to its Discretionary allocation on activities other than construction or renovation (i.e., direct services, quality activities, or administrative costs).</P>
              <P>(h) A construction or renovation project that requires and receives approval by the Secretary must include as part of the construction and renovation costs:</P>
              <P>(1) planning costs as allowed at § 98.84(c);</P>
              <P>(2) labor, materials and services necessary for the functioning of the facility; and</P>
              <P>(3) initial equipment for the facility. Equipment means items which are tangible, nonexpendable personal property having a useful life of more than five years.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability</E>—The requirements of this subpart apply to the fifty States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Generally</E>—States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico shall calculate, prepare and submit to the Department, a report of errors occurring in the administration of CCDF grant funds, at times and in a manner specified by the Secretary in instructions. States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico must use this report to calculate their error rates, which is defined as the percentage of cases with an error (expressed as the total number of cases with an error compared to the total number of cases); the percentage of cases with an improper payment (expressed as the total number of cases with an improper payment compared to the total number of cases); the percentage of improper payments (expressed as the total amount of improper payments in the sample compared to the total dollar amount of payments made in the sample); the average amount of improper payment; and the estimated annual amount of improper payments. The report also will provide strategies for reducing their error rates and allow States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to set target error rates for the next cycle.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Error Defined</E>—For purposes of this subpart, an “error” shall mean any violation or misapplication of statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements governing the administration of CCDF grant funds, regardless of whether such violation results in an improper payment.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Improper Payment Defined</E>—For purposes of this subpart, “improper payment.”</P>
              <P>(1) Means any payment of CCDF grant funds that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount (including overpayments and underpayments) under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements governing the administration of CCDF grant funds; and</P>
              <P>(2) Includes any payment of CCDF grant funds to an ineligible recipient, any payment of CCDF grant funds for an ineligible service, any duplicate payment of CCDF grant funds and payments of CCDF grant funds for services not received. Because a child meeting eligibility requirements at the most recent eligibility determination or redetermination is considered eligible between redeterminations as described in § 98.21(a)(1), any payment for such a child shall not be considered an error or improper payment due to a change in the family's circumstances, as set forth at § 98.21(a) and (b).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Costs of Preparing the Error Rate Report</E>—Provided the error rate calculations and reports focus on client eligibility, expenses incurred by the States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in complying with this rule, including preparation of required reports, shall be considered a cost of direct service related to eligibility determination and therefore is not subject to the five percent limitation on CCDF administrative costs pursuant to § 98.54(a).</P>

For purposes of the case reviews, States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico shall select a random sample of case records which is estimated to achieve the calculation of an estimated annual amount of improper payments with a 90 percent confidence interval of ±5.0 percent.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Methodology and Forms</E>—States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico must prepare and submit forms issued by the Secretary, following the accompanying instructions setting forth the methodology to be used in conducting case reviews and calculating the error rates.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reporting Frequency and Cycle</E>—States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico shall conduct case reviews and submit error rate reports to the Department according to a staggered three-year cycle established by the Secretary such that each State, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico will be selected once, and only once, in every three years.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Access to Federal Staff</E>—States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico must provide access to Federal staff to participate and provide oversight in case reviews and error rate calculations, including access to forms related to determining error rates.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Record Retention</E>—Records pertinent to the case reviews and submission of error rate reports shall be retained for a period of five years from the date of submission of the applicable error rate report or, if the error rate report was revised, from the date of submission of the revision.

              <SUBJECT>Issues at hearing.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The Assistant Secretary may, prior to a hearing under § 98.91 of this part, notify the Lead Agency in writing of additional issues which will be considered at the hearing. Such notice shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> If such notice is received by the Lead Agency less than 20 days before the date of the hearing, a postponement of the hearing shall be granted at the request of the Lead Agency or any other party. The hearing shall be held on a date 20 days after such notice was received, or on such later date as agreed to by the Assistant Secretary.</P>

              <P>(b) If, as a result of negotiations between the Department and the Lead Agency, the submittal of a Plan amendment, a change in the Lead Agency program, or other action by the Lead Agency, any issue is resolved in whole or in part, but new or modified issues are presented, as specified by the Assistant Secretary, the hearing shall proceed on such new or modified issues. A notice of such new or modified issues shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> If such notice is received by the Lead Agency less than 20 days before the date of the hearing, a postponement of the hearing shall be granted at the request of the Lead Agency or any other party. The hearing shall be held on a date 20 days after such notice was received, or on such later date as agreed to by the Assistant Secretary.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) If, at any time, the Assistant Secretary finds that the Lead Agency has come into compliance with Federal statutes and regulations on any issue, in whole or in part, the Assistant Secretary shall remove such issue from the proceedings, in whole or in part, as may be appropriate. If all issues are removed, the Assistant Secretary shall terminate the hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to the removal of any issue from the hearing, in whole or in part, the Assistant Secretary shall provide all parties other than the Department and the Lead Agency (see § 99.15(b)) with written notice of the intention, and the reasons for it. Such notice shall include a copy of the proposed CCDF Plan provision on which the Lead Agency and Assistant Secretary have settled. The parties shall have 15 days from the receipt of such notice to file their views or any information on the merits of the proposed Plan provision and the merits of the Assistant Secretary's reasons for removing the issue from the hearing.</P>
              <P>(d) The issues considered at the hearing shall be limited to those issues of which the Lead Agency is notified, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, and new or modified issues described in paragraph (b) of this section; they shall not include issues or parts of issues removed from the proceedings pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Request to participate in hearing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Department and the Lead Agency are parties to the hearing without making a specific request to participate.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Other individuals or groups may be recognized as parties, if the issues to be considered at the hearing have directly caused them injury and their interest is immediately within the zone of interests to be protected by the governing Federal statute and regulations.</P>

              <P>(2) Any individual or group wishing to participate as a party shall file a petition with the presiding officer within 15 days after notice of the hearing has been published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and shall serve a copy on each party of record at that time, in accordance with § 99.5(b). Such petition shall concisely state:</P>
              <P>(i) Petitioner's interest in the proceeding;</P>
              <P>(ii) Who will appear for petitioner;</P>
              <P>(iii) The issues on which petitioner wishes to participate; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Whether petitioner intends to present witnesses.</P>
              <P>(3) Any party may, within 5 days of receipt of such petition, file comments on it.</P>

              <P>(4) The presiding officer shall promptly determine whether each petitioner has the requisite interest in the proceedings and shall permit or deny participation accordingly. Where petitions to participate as parties are made by individuals or groups with common <PRTPAGE P="751"/>interests, at the presiding officer's discretion, the presiding officer may request that all such petitioners designate a single representative or may recognize one or more of such petitioners to represent all such petitioners. The presiding officer shall give each petitioner written notice of the decision on the petition, and if the petition is denied, the presiding officer shall briefly state the grounds for denial. If the petition is denied, the presiding officer may recognize the petitioner as an amicus curiae.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Any interested person or organization wishing to participate as an amicus curiae shall file a petition with the presiding officer before the commencement of the hearing. Such petition shall concisely state:</P>
              <P>(i) The petitioner's interest in the hearing;</P>
              <P>(ii) Who will represent the petitioner; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The issues on which petitioner intends to present argument.</P>
              <P>An amicus curiae is not a party but may participate as provided in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(2) The presiding officer may grant the petition upon finding that the petitioner has a legitimate interest in the proceedings, that such participation will not unduly delay the outcome, and it may contribute materially to the proper disposition of the issues.</P>
              <P>(3) An amicus curiae may present a brief oral statement at the hearing, at the point in the proceedings specified by the presiding officer. The amicus curiae may submit a written statement of position to the presiding officer prior to the beginning of a hearing and shall serve a copy on each party. The amicus curiae may also submit a brief or written statement at such time as the parties submit briefs and shall serve a copy on each party.</P>

                <P>(c) Section 201(e) of E.O. 13603 provides that each department that is delegated priorities and allocations authority under Section 201(a) of E.O. 13603 may use this authority with respect to control of the general distribution of any material (including applicable services) in the civilian market only after:</P>
                <P>(1) Making the finding required under Section 101(b) of the DPA; and</P>
                <P>(2) The finding has been approved by the President.</P>
                <P>(d) Priorities authorities (and other authorities delegated to the Secretary in E.O. 13603 but not covered by this regulation) have been re-delegated by the Secretary to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (the “ASPR”). The Secretary retains the authority for allocations.</P>

              <P>(b) A required delivery date or dates. The words “immediately” or “as soon as possible” do not constitute a delivery date. A “requirements contract”, “basic ordering agreement”, “prime vendor contract”, or similar procurement document bearing a priority rating may contain no specific delivery date or dates and may provide for the furnishing of items or service from time-to-time or within a stated period against specific purchase orders, such as “calls”, “requisitions”, and “delivery orders”. These purchase orders must specify a required delivery date or dates and are to be considered as rated as of the date of their receipt by the supplier and not as of the date of the original procurement document;<PRTPAGE P="762"/>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Mandatory acceptance.</E> (1) Except as otherwise specified in this section, a person shall accept every rated order received and must fill such orders regardless of any other rated or unrated orders that have been accepted.</P>
              <P>(2) A person shall not discriminate against rated orders in any manner such as by charging higher prices or by imposing different terms and conditions than for comparable unrated orders.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Mandatory rejection.</E> Unless otherwise directed by HHS for a rated order involving all forms of health resources:</P>
              <P>(1) A person shall not accept a rated order for delivery on a specific date if unable to fill the order by that date. However, the person must inform the customer of the earliest date on which delivery can be made and offer to accept the order on the basis of that date. Scheduling conflicts with previously accepted lower rated or unrated orders are not sufficient reason for rejection under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) A person shall not accept a DO-rated order for delivery on a date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DO- or DX-rated orders. However, the person must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.</P>
              <P>(3) A person shall not accept a DX-rated order for delivery on a date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DX-rated orders, but must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.</P>
              <P>(4) If a person is unable to fill all of the rated orders of equal priority status received on the same day, the person must accept, based upon the earliest delivery dates, only those orders which can be filled, and reject the other orders. For example, a person must accept order A requiring delivery on December 15 before accepting order B requiring delivery on December 31. However, the person must offer to accept the rejected orders based on the earliest delivery dates otherwise possible.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Optional rejection.</E> Unless otherwise directed by HHS for a rated order involving all forms of health resources, rated orders may be rejected in any of the following cases as long as a supplier does not discriminate among customers:</P>
              <P>(1) If the person placing the order is unwilling or unable to meet regularly established terms of sale or payment;</P>
              <P>(2) If the order is for an item not supplied or for a service not capable of being performed;</P>

              <P>(3) If the order is for an item or service produced, acquired, or provided only for the supplier's own use for which no orders have been filled for two years prior to the date of receipt of the rated order. If, however, a supplier has sold some of these items or provided similar services, the supplier is obligated to accept rated orders up to that quantity or portion of production <PRTPAGE P="763"/>or service, whichever is greater, sold or provided within the past two years;</P>
              <P>(4) If the person placing the rated order, other than the U.S. Government, makes the item or performs the service being ordered;</P>
              <P>(5) If acceptance of a rated order or performance against a rated order would violate any other regulation, official action, or order of the HHS issued under the authority of the DPA or another relevant statute.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Customer notification requirements.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a person must accept or reject a rated order in writing or electronically within fifteen (15) working days after receipt of a DO-rated order and within ten (10) working days after receipt of a DX-rated order. If the order is rejected, the person must give reasons in writing or electronically for the rejection.</P>
              <P>(2) If a person has accepted a rated order and subsequently finds that shipment or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer immediately, give the reasons for the delay, and advise of a new shipment or performance date. If notification is given verbally, written or electronic confirmation must be provided within five (5) working days.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Exception for emergency response conditions.</E> If the rated order is placed for the purpose of emergency preparedness, a person must accept or reject a rated order and transmit the acceptance or rejection in writing or in an electronic format within two (2) days after receipt of the order if:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preferential scheduling.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A person must schedule operations, including the acquisition of all needed production items or services, in a timely manner to satisfy the delivery requirements of each rated order. Modifying production or delivery schedules is necessary only when required delivery dates for rated orders cannot otherwise be met.</P>
              <P>(b) DO-rated orders must be given production preference over unrated orders, if necessary to meet required delivery dates, even if this requires the diversion of items being processed or ready for delivery or services being performed against unrated orders. Similarly, DX-rated orders must be given preference over DO-rated orders and unrated orders. (Examples: If a person receives a DO-rated order with a delivery date of June 3 and if meeting that date would mean delaying production or delivery of an item for an unrated order, the unrated order must be delayed. If a DX-rated order is received calling for delivery on July 15 and a person has a DO-rated order requiring delivery on June 2 and operations can be scheduled to meet both deliveries, there is no need to alter production schedules to give any additional preference to the DX-rated order.)</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Conflicting rated orders.</E> (1) If a person finds that delivery or performance against any accepted rated orders conflicts with the delivery or performance against other accepted rated orders of equal priority status, the person shall give precedence to the conflicting orders in the sequence in which they are to be delivered or performed (not to the receipt dates). If the conflicting orders are scheduled to be delivered or performed on the same day, the person shall give precedence to those orders that have the earliest receipt dates.</P>
              <P>(2) If a person is unable to resolve rated order delivery or performance conflicts under this section, the person should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in §§ 101.40 through 101.44. If the person's customer objects to the rescheduling of delivery or performance of a rated order, the customer should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in §§ 101.40 through 101.44. For any rated order against which delivery or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer as provided in § 101.33(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(d) If a person is unable to purchase needed production items in time to fill a rated order by its required delivery date, the person must fill the rated order by using inventoried production items. A person who uses inventoried items to fill a rated order may replace those items with the use of a rated order as provided in § 101.37(b).</P>

The person must use the priority rating indicated on the customer's rated order, except as otherwise provided in this part or as directed by the Department of Health and Human Services.</P>
              <P>(b) The priority rating must be included on each successive order placed to obtain items or services needed to fill a customer's rated order. This continues from contractor to subcontractor to supplier throughout the entire procurement chain.</P>

              <P>(a) The priority rating on a rated order may be changed or canceled by:</P>
              <P>(1) An official action of HHS; or</P>
              <P>(2) Written notification from the originating agency that placed the rated order.</P>
              <P>(b) If an unrated order is amended so as to make it a rated order, or a DO rating is changed to a DX rating, the supplier must give the appropriate preferential treatment to the order as of the date the change is received by the supplier.</P>
              <P>(c) An amendment to a rated order that significantly alters a supplier's original production or delivery schedule shall constitute a new rated order as of the date of its receipt. The supplier must accept or reject the amended order according to the provisions of § 101.33.</P>
              <P>(d) The following amendments do not constitute a new rated order: a change in shipping destination; a reduction in the total amount of the order; an increase in the total amount of the order which has negligible impact upon deliveries; a minor variation in size or design; or a change which is agreed upon between the supplier and the customer.</P>
              <P>(e) If a person no longer needs items or services to fill a rated order, any rated orders placed with suppliers for the items or services, or the priority rating on those orders, must be canceled.</P>
              <P>(f) When a priority rating is added to an unrated order, or is changed or canceled, all suppliers must be promptly notified in writing.</P>

              <P>(a) A person must use rated orders to obtain:</P>
              <P>(1) Items which will be physically incorporated into other items to fill rated orders, including that portion of such items normally consumed or converted into scrap or by-products in the course of processing;</P>
              <P>(2) Containers or other packaging materials required to make delivery of the finished items against rated orders;</P>
              <P>(3) Services, other than contracts of employment, needed to fill rated orders; and</P>
              <P>(4) MRO needed to produce the finished items to fill rated orders.</P>
              <P>(b) A person may use a rated order to replace inventoried items (including finished items) if such items were used to fill rated orders, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The order must be placed within 90 days of the date of use of the inventory.</P>
              <P>(2) A DO rating and the program identification symbol indicated on the customer's rated order must be used on the order. A DX rating may not be used even if the inventory was used to fill a DX-rated order.</P>

              <P>(3) If the priority ratings on rated orders from one customer or several customers contain different program identification symbols, the rated orders may be combined. In this case, the program identification symbol “H1” must be used (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> DO-H1).</P>

              <P>(c) A person may combine DX- and DO-rated orders from one customer or several customers if the items or services covered by each level of priority are identified separately and clearly. If different program identification symbols are indicated on those rated orders of equal priority, the person must use the program identification symbol “H1” (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> DO-H1 or DX-H1).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Combining rated and unrated orders.</E> (1) A person may combine rated and unrated order quantities on one purchase order provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The rated quantities are separately and clearly identified; and</P>

              <P>(ii) The four elements of a rated order, as required by § 101.32, are included on the order with the statement required in § 101.32(d) modified to read in substance:

              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(2) A supplier must accept or reject the rated portion of the purchase order as provided in § 101.33 and give preferential treatment only to the rated quantities as required by this part. This part may not be used to require preferential treatment for the unrated portion of the order.</P>
              <P>(3) Any supplier who believes that rated and unrated orders are being combined in a manner contrary to the intent of this part or in a fashion that causes undue or exceptional hardship may submit a request for adjustment or exception under § 101.80.</P>
              <P>(e) A person may place a rated order for the minimum commercially procurable quantity even if the quantity needed to fill a rated order is less than that minimum. However, a person must combine rated orders as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if possible, to obtain minimum procurable quantities.</P>
              <P>(f) A person is not required to place a priority rating on an order for less than one-half of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (as established in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (see 48 CFR 2.101) or in other authorized acquisition regulatory or management systems) whichever amount is greater, provided that delivery can be obtained in a timely fashion without the use of the priority rating.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The six regulations that comprise the Federal Priorities and Allocations System are designed to be largely self-executing. However, from time-to-time production or delivery problems will arise in connection with rated orders for health resources as covered under this part. In this event, a person should immediately contact the Secretary for guidance, as specified in § 101.93. If the HHS is unable to resolve the problem or to authorize the use of a priority rating and believes additional assistance is warranted, HHS may forward the request to another agency with resource jurisdiction, or the Department of Commerce, as appropriate, for action. Special priorities assistance is provided to alleviate problems that do arise.</P>
              <P>(b) Special priorities assistance is available for any reason consistent with this part. Generally, special priorities assistance is provided to expedite deliveries, resolve delivery conflicts, place rated orders, locate suppliers, or to verify information supplied by customers and vendors. Special priorities assistance may also be used to request rating authority for items that are not normally eligible for priority treatment.</P>
              <P>(c) A request for special priorities assistance or priority rating authority must be submitted to the Secretary, as specified in § 101.93.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requests for priority rating authority.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If a rated order is likely to be delayed because a person is unable to obtain items or services not normally rated under this part, the person may request the authority to use a priority rating in ordering the needed items or services.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Rating authority for production or construction equipment.</E> (1) A request for priority rating authority for production or construction equipment must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce on Form BIS-999.</P>
              <P>(2) When the use of a priority rating is authorized for the procurement of production or construction equipment, a rated order may be used either to purchase or to lease such equipment. However, in the latter case, the equipment may be leased only from a person engaged in the business of leasing such equipment or from a person willing to lease rather than sell.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract.</E> (1) In certain cases and upon specific request, the Department of Health and Human Services, in order to promote the national defense, may authorize a person to place a priority rating on an order to a supplier in advance of the issuance of a rated prime contract. In these instances, the person requesting advance-rating authority must obtain sponsorship of the request from the Department of Health and Human Services or the appropriate Delegate Agency. The person shall also assume any business risk associated with the placing of rated orders in the event the rated prime contract is not issued.</P>

              <P>(2) The person must state the following in the request:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>It is understood that the authorization of a priority rating in advance of our receiving a rated prime contract from the Department of Health and Human Services and our use of that priority rating with our suppliers in no way commits the Department of Health and Human Services or any other government agency to enter into a contract or order or to expend funds. Further, we understand that the Federal Government shall not be liable for any cancellation charges, termination costs, or other damages that may accrue if a rated prime contract is not eventually placed and, as a result, we must subsequently cancel orders placed with the use of the priority rating authorized as a result of this request.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(3) In reviewing requests for rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract, HHS will consider, among other things, the following criteria:</P>

              <P>(i) The probability that the prime contract will be awarded;<PRTPAGE P="767"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The impact of the resulting rated orders on suppliers and on other authorized programs;</P>
              <P>(iii) Whether the contractor is the sole source;</P>
              <P>(iv) Whether the item being produced has a long lead time;</P>
              <P>(v) The time period for which the rating is being requested.</P>
              <P>(4) The HHS may require periodic reports on the use of the rating authority granted under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) If a rated prime contract is not issued, the person shall promptly notify all suppliers who have received rated orders pursuant to the advanced rating authority that the priority rating on those orders is cancelled.</P>
