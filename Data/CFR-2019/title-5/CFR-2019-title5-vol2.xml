      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>This section incorporates the statutory requirements for establishing and conducting an equal opportunity recruitment program consistent with law within the Federal civil service. The policy in 5 U.S.C. 7201(b) reads as follows: “It is the policy of the United States to insure equal employment opportunities for employees without discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The President shall use his existing authority to carry out this policy.” 5 U.S.C. 7201(c) requires under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>“(1) That each Executive agency conduct a continuing program for the recruitment of members of minorities for positions in the agency to carry out the [anti-discrimination] policy set forth in subsection (b) in a manner designed to eliminate underrepresentation of minorities in the various categories of civil service employment within the Federal service, with special efforts directed at recruiting in minority communities, in educational institutions, and from other sources from which minorities can be recruited; and</P>
                <P>“(2) That the Office conduct a continuing program of—</P>
                <P>“(A) Assistance to agencies in carrying out programs under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and</P>
                <P>“(B) Evaluation and oversight of such recruitment programs to determine their effectiveness in eliminating such minority underrepresentation.”</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              

              <FP>This section and all implementing guidance shall be interpreted consistent with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2000c <E T="03">et seq.</E>

              <P>For the purposes of this subpart:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Underrepresentation</E> means a situation in which the number of women or members of a minority group within a category of civil service employment constitutes a lower percentage of the total number of employees within the employment category than the percentage women or the minority constitutes within the civilian labor force of the United States, in accordance with § 720.205 (c) and (d).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Category of civil service employment</E> means such groupings of Federal jobs by grades and/or occupations as the Office of Personnel Management deems appropriate within the General Schedule and the prevailing wage systems.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Minority</E> refers only to those groups classified as “minority” for the purpose of data collection by the Office of Personnel Management and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in furtherance of Federal equal employment opportunity policies. The term, “women,” includes nonminority as well as minority women.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Civilian labor force</E> (CLF) includes all persons 16 years of age and over, except those in the armed forces, who are employed or who are unemployed and seeking work. CLF data are defined by the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are reported in the most recent decennial or mid-decade census, or current population survey, under title 13 of the United States Code or any other reliable statistical study.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Recruitment</E> means the total process by which the Federal Government and the Federal agencies locate, identify and assist in the employment of qualified applicants from underrepresented groups for job openings in categories of employment where underrepresentation has been determined. It includes both innovative internal and external recruitment actions. It is also intended to cover processes designed to prepare qualifiable applicants (those who have the potential but do not presently meet valid qualification requirements) for such job openings through <PRTPAGE P="7"/>programs of training, work experience or both.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Applicant pool</E> means all types of listings from which selections may be made, including (but not limited to) promotion lists, competitive certificates and inventories of eligibles, applicant supply files, and lists of eligibles for certain noncompetitive appointments.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Responsibilities of the Office of Personnel Management.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Office of Personnel Management will provide appropriate data to assist Federal agencies in making determinations of underrepresentation. The process for making such determinations is described in sections II and III (c) of the “Guidelines for the Development of a Federal Recruitment Program to Implement 5 U.S.C. 7201, as amended” (See appendix to this part). The Office will develop and publish more specific criteria for statistical measurements to be used by individual agencies, and will develop further guidance on—</P>
              <P>(1) Agency employment statistics and civilian labor force statistics to be used in making determinations of underrepresentation, on a national, regional or other geographic basis as appropriate;</P>
              <P>(2) Groupings of grades and/or other occupational categories to be used in implementing agency programs;</P>
              <P>(3) Occupational categories and job series for which expanded external recruitment efforts are most appropriate, and those for which expanded and innovative internal recruitment is appropriate; and</P>
              <P>(4) Other factors which may be considered by the agency, in consultation with Office of Personnel Management, to make determinations of underrepresentation and to develop recruitment programs focused on specific occupational categories.</P>
              <P>(b) The Office will assist agencies in carrying out their programs by—</P>
              <P>(1) Identifying major recruitment sources of women and members of minority groups and providing guidance on internal and external recruitment activities directed toward the solution of specific underrepresentation problem;</P>
              <P>(2) Supplementing agency recruitment efforts, utilizing existing networks for dissemination of job information, and involving the participation of minority group and women's organizations where practicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Examining existing Federal personnel procedures to identify those which (i) may serve as impediments to innovative internal and external recruitment and (ii) are within the administrative control of the Office or the Federal agencies;</P>
              <P>(4) Determining whether applicant pools used in filling jobs in a category of employment where underrepresentation exists include sufficient candidates from any underrepresentated groups, except where the agency controls such pools (see § 720.204(c));</P>
              <P>(5) Providing such other support, as the Office deems appropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) The Office will monitor and, in conjunction with the personnel management evaluation program of the Office, evaluate agency programs to determine their effectiveness in eliminating underrepresentation.</P>
              <P>(d) The Office will work with agencies to develop effective mechanisms for providing information on Federal job opportunities targeted to reach candidates from underrepresented groups.</P>
              <P>(e) The Office will conduct a continuing program of guidance and instruction to supplement these regulations.</P>
              <P>(f) The Office will coordinate further activities to implement equal opportunity recruitment programs under this subpart with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission consistent with law, Executive Order 12067, and Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Agency programs.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Each Executive agency having positions in the pay systems covered by this program must conduct a continuing program for the recruitment of minorities and women for positions in the agency and its components to carry out the policy of the United States to insure equal employment opportunities without discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. The head of each agency must specifically assign responsibility for program <PRTPAGE P="8"/>implementation to an appropriate agency official. All agency officials who have responsibility for the program will be evaluated on their effectiveness in carrying it out as part of their periodic performance appraisals.</P>
              <P>(b) Programs established under this subpart must be designed to cover recruitment for all positions in pay plans covered by this program including part-time and temporary positions.</P>
              <P>(c) Where an agency or the Office of Personnel Management has determined that an applicant pool does not adequately provide for consideration of candidates from any underrepresented group, the agency or agency component must take one or more of the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) Expand or otherwise redirect their recruitment activities in ways designed to increase the number of candidates from underrepresented groups in that applicant pool;</P>
              <P>(2) Use selection methods involving other applicant pools which include sufficient numbers of members of underrepresented groups;</P>
              <P>(3) Notify the office responsible for administering that applicant pool, and request its reopening of application receipt in support of expanded recruitment activities or certifying from equivalent registers existing in other geographic areas; and/or</P>
              <P>(4) Take such other action consistent with law which will contribute to the elimination of underrepresentation in the category of employment involved.</P>
              <P>(d) Agencies must notify and seek advice and assistance from the Office of Personnel Management in cases where their equal opportunity recruitment programs are not making measurable progress in eliminating identified underrepresentation in the agency work force.</P>
            </SECTION>

              <SECTNO>§ 720.205</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Agency plans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each agency must have an up-to-date equal opportunity recruitment program plan covering recruitment for positions at various organizational levels and geographic locations within the agency. Such plans must be available for review in appropriate offices of the agency and must be submitted to the Office of Personnel Management on request. In accordance with agreement reached between the Office and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, such plans must be incorporated in the agency's equal employment opportunity plans required under section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, pursuant to regulations and instructions of the Commission, provided they are separable parts of those plans for purposes of review by and submission to the Office of Personnel Management. Agency organizational and geographical components which are required to develop and submit Equal Employment Opportunity plans, under instructions issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, must also have up-to-date special recruitment program plans. On a determination by the Office of Personnel Management, in consultation with EEOC, that additional component plans are needed to implement an agency's program effectively, the Office will instruct the agency to develop additional plans. Agencies must comply with such instructions.</P>
              <P>(b) Agency plans must include annual specific determinations of underrepresentation for each group and must be accompanied by quantifiable indices by which progress toward eliminating underrepresentation can be measured.</P>
              <P>(c) Where an agency or agency component is located in a geographical area where the percentage of underrepresented groups in the area civilian labor force is higher than their percentage in the national labor force, the agency or component must base its plans on the higher level of representation in the relevant civilian labor force.</P>

              <P>(d) Where an agency or agency component is located in a geographical area where participation of a particular underrepresented group is significantly lower than its participation in the national labor force, the agency or component may, in consultation with the Office of Personnel Management, use the lower percentage in determining underrepresentation. An agency may not use a figure lower than the relevant regional or nationwide labor force percentage where recruitment on a regional or nationwide basis is feasible for particular categories of employment. Factors such as size of <PRTPAGE P="9"/>the agency or unit, nature of jobs and their wage or pay scale may be considered in focusing recruitment for various job categories.</P>
              <P>(e) In addition to the underrepresentation determinations described in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, agency plans must, at a minimum, include:</P>
              <P>(1) An assessment of grades or job categories and numbers of jobs in such categories expected to be filled in the current year, and on a longer term basis (based on anticipated turnover, expansion, hiring limits and other relevant factors) identification of those occupational categories and positions suitable for external recruitment, and description of special targeted recruitment programs for such jobs and positions;</P>
              <P>(2) A similar assessment for job categories and positions likely to be filled by recruitment from within the agency and/or the Federal civil service system and a description of recruitment programs developed to increase minority and female candidates from internal sources for such positions;</P>
              <P>(3) A further assessment of internal availability of candidates from underrepresentated groups for higher job progressions by identifying job-related skills, knowledges and abilities which may be obtained at lower levels in the same or similar occupational series, or through other experience;</P>

              <P>It is the policy of the United States to insure equal employment opportunities for employees without discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. [5 U.S.C. 7151] <SU>2</SU>

              </FTNT>
              <P>In 1978, Congress reaffirmed and amended this policy as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 [Sec. 310 of Pub. L. 95-454], requiring immediate development of a recruitment program designed to eliminate underrepresentation of minority groups in specific Federal job categories. Section 310 directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission:</P>
              <P>1. To establish Guidelines proposed to be used for a program designed to eliminate such underrepresentation;</P>

              </FTNT>

              <P>B. In framing these Guidelines and making its initial determinations of underrepresentation, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (Commission) is acting pursuant to its obligations and authority under 5 U.S.C. 7201, as amended; Section 717 of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978 (issued pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 901 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and Executive Order 12067, issued under this Plan (43 FR 28967, June 30, 1978). This Commission must develop and/or ensure the development of uniform, coherent and effective standards for administration and enforcement of all Federal anti-discrimination and equal employment opportunity laws, policies and programs, and to ensure the elimination of duplication and inconsistency in such programs.</P>
              <P>C. A review of the legislative history of Federal equal employment opportunity policy provides further guidance on the scope and nature of determinations and guidelines to be issued for this program.</P>
              <P>The basic policy statement on Federal equal employment policy enacted by the Congress in 1964 (5 U.S.C. 7151, redesignated as section 7201) gave the President authority for implementation. Executive Order 11246 (1966), expanded and superseded by Executive Order 11478 (1969) with respect to Federal employment, required Federal agencies to develop affirmative action programs designed to eliminate discrimination and assure equal employment opportunity.</P>
              <P>In 1972, Congress found that serious discrimination persisted in Federal employment. It found that minorities and women were significantly absent at higher levels in Federal employment, and severely underrepresented in some Federal agencies and in some geographic areas where they constituted significant proportions of the population. After a detailed review of Federal employment practices and statistics, the Congress concluded that:</P>
              <P>The disproportionate distribution of minorities and women throughout the Federal bureaucracy and their exclusion from higher level policy-making and supervisory positions indicates the government's failure to pursue its policy of equal employment opportunity. <SU>5</SU>

              </FTNT>
              <P>Congress found that this exclusion resulted from overt and “systemic” discriminatory practices.</P>
              <P>These findings, among others, led Congress to extend title VII coverage to Federal employment in Section 717 of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972.</P>
              <P>The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 clearly states, for the first time, that “it is the policy of the United States * * * to provide * * * a Federal workforce reflective of the Nation's diversity * * *” <SU>6</SU>
                <FTREF/> The Act establishes in law as the first merit principle that recruitment should be designed to achieve a Federal workforce from “all segments of society.” Among the personnel practices prohibited by the Act is discrimination prohibited under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. <SU>7</SU>
                <FTREF/> Therefore, the Civil Service Reform Act and its directive for a special recruitment program clearly unite requirements for basic Federal personnel policy with requirements for Federal equal employment policy.</P>

              <P>It is clear from the legislative history of Federal equal employment policy that the legal standards of title VII must be applied to Federal employment. Thus, guidelines for a recruitment program designed to eliminate underrepresentation in Federal agency employment must be developed consistent with the framework of affirmative action programs.</P>
              <P>D. Guided by the review of the legislative history, and the responsibilities and authorities cited in I(B) of this appendix, the Commission is issuing these Guidelines to provide a framework for development of recruitment program regulations by OPM. The Commission may later provide more detailed guidance, through consultation with OPM, designed to achieve an overall Federal equal employment program which is consistent with, and which effectively implements title VII requirements.</P>

Pursuant to Section 7201, underrepresentation exists when the percentages of minority and female Federal employees in <PRTPAGE P="14"/>specific grades are less than their percentages in the civilian labor force. “Minority” refers only to those groups classified as “minority” for the purpose of data collection by the Commission and OPM in furtherance of Federal equal employment opportunity policies. The civilian labor force includes all persons 16 years of age and over except the armed forces, who are employed or seeking employment. Such a determination of underrepresentation is designated in these Guidelines as “below the Section 7201 level”.</P>
              <P>B. The Commission has examined existing data on Federal employment and the civilian labor force and has made initial determinations of underrepresentation of groups by race, national origin and sex in specific grades of the major Federal pay systems, under the legal authorities cited in I(B), of this appendix.</P>
              <P>C. The Table which follows shows the grades at which the percentage of each group in the Federal workforce falls below its percentage in the civilian labor force. The table covers four major Federal pay systems which account for more than 95 percent of Federal employees, excluding the Postal Service. <SU>8</SU>

              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>8</SU> The initial determinations are based on data for only those agencies covered by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. The Commission will make subsequent determinations on other agencies covered by title VII, e.g. the U.S. Postal Service, TVA, Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Reserve Board.</P>

                <TNOTE>Sources: Civilian Labor Force information based on data from the Current Population Survey, Bureau of Labor Statistics, <E T="03">Employment and Earnings,</E> Vol. 25, No. 1, January 1978.</TNOTE>

                <TNOTE>Information on grades below 7201 level based on Office of Personnel Management data from <E T="03">Equal Employment Opportunity Statistics,</E> November 20, 1977 (publication in process).</TNOTE>
              </GPOTABLE>

              <P>D. The initial determinations of underrepresentation were based upon average 1977 labor force data from the Current Population Survey published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (<E T="03">Employment and Earnings,</E> January 1978), and 1977 Federal workforce statistics from <E T="03">Equal Employment Opportunity Statistics</E> (publication in process).</P>
              <P>The labor force figures are published annually; the Federal employment statistics semiannually. These measures, and any modifications agreed upon by the Commission and OPM, will be updated annually.</P>
              <P>Regional and area Federal employment statistics are available from the Office of Personnel Management. The latest reliable local labor force data by race, national origin, and sex is from the 1970 Census. The Commission and OPM will consult on appropriate labor force measures to be used for local analyses.</P>

              <P>E. These initial determinations are based upon a preliminary analysis of the data, and may be further refined by the Commission, in consultation with OPM, to include geographic and occupational underrepresentation. It is further recognized that for the purpose of developing regulations, the OPM, in consultation with the Commission, will undertake more specific analyses of data use and applicability necessary to develop programs for the Federal agencies pursuant to Section 7201(a)(2)(C). The OPM may establish criteria for grouping agencies, for treating <PRTPAGE P="15"/>agency components separately and for grouping grades and pay systems. In addition, OPM may study other available data sources and use other techniques to assure statistically significant findings of underrepresentation. Based upon these studies, OPM may make recommendations to the Commission for future determinations of underrepresentation.</P>
              <P>III. <E T="03">Procedures for Developing Recruitment Programs.</E> A. The program developed and implemented by OPM under Section 7201 should be designed to result in applicant pools with sufficient qualified members of underrepresented groups. Where the supply of such groups initially appears to be low for specific occupational, professional and other groupings, the program should be designed so that recruitment efforts stimulate interest of underrepresented groups in those occupations where there are realistic projections of Federal employment opportunities.</P>
              <P>B. In establishing groupings for determining underrepresentation, OPM should utilize broad occupational categories to the extent possible.</P>
              <P>C. The Commission recognizes that OPM's regulations should allow flexibility in development and design of each Federal agency's recruitment program. However, all statistical comparisons must be computed in a manner consistent with the method utilized in II C of this appendix.</P>
              <P>The Commission recommends that each agency program meet several minimum requirements. The program should be based on a determination of underrepresentation in the agency's total workforce, in appropriate geographic components; by grade; by broad occupational, professional and other groupings in comparison to the national civilian labor force, according to the criteria developed by OPM under these guidelines.</P>

              <P>Where an agency or major component thereof (such as Headquarters and Regional Offices) is located in a geographic area where the percentage of underrepresented groups in the area civilian labor force is <E T="03">higher</E> than their percentage in the national labor force, the agency or appropriate component should conduct its recruitment program for that component on the basis of the higher level of representation in the relevant civilian labor force.</P>

              <P>Where an agency or major component thereof is located in a geographic area where participation of a particular underrepresented group in the area labor force is significantly <E T="03">lower</E> than their participation in the national labor force, such agency or component may, in consultation with OPM, utilize the lower applicable civilian labor force percentage in determining underrepresentation for the component. In no event, however, may the agency utilize a figure lower than the regional or nationwide Section 7201 level for positions where recruitment on a regional or nationwide basis is feasible. Factors such as size of the agency or unit, nature of jobs and their wage or pay scale may be considered to set goals and to justify a recruitment program focused on various job categories.</P>
              <P>IV. <E T="03">Scope of Actions Covered by This Program.</E> A. “Recruitment” under this program is defined as the total process by which the Federal Government and the Federal agencies locate, identify and assist in the employment of qualified or qualifiable applicants from underrepresented groups for job openings in grades and in occupational categories where underrepresentation has been determined. This process should include innovative internal, as well as targeted external, recruitment actions.</P>

              <P>B. Prior to developing regulations, the Office should review data on personnel actions and other information, to identify those job categories for which internal recruitment and external recruitment is most appropriate and feasible, and to provide guidance to the Federal agencies for targeting their recruitment programs, based on this information. OPM should advise all agencies that all job qualifications, personnel procedures and criteria must be consistent with the <E T="03">Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures</E> (43 FR 38290 August 25, 1978) OPM should consider the following in providing guidance to agencies:</P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">External Recruitment Programs.</E> a. Such programs should focus on grade levels and/or job categories where underrepresentation has been identified and where external recruitment realistically will result in hiring opportunities.</P>
              <P>Recruitment programs also should include a review of job functions to determine those jobs that may be better performed by persons who are bicultural and who have bilingual capabilities, and those jobs that can be performed by persons not fluent in English.</P>
              <P>b. Where eligibility lists are used for filling jobs, it is recommended that the regulations require, an analysis by race, national origin and sex, to determine whether the list contains sufficient candidates from groups underrepresented in those jobs. OPM should require that where the list does not have such representation, expanded recruitment procedures be designed to assure that members of underrepresented groups qualified to perform the job(s) are included in the pool of applicants from which the selecting official makes the selection. Such expanded recruitment procedures may include additional external recruitment or various actions (such as described in 2. below) to reach members of these groups within the Federal workforce who are qualified or qualifiable for these jobs.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Internal Recruitment Programs.</E> a. Internal recruitment programs should be designed by agencies to identify currently qualified or <PRTPAGE P="16"/>qualifiable persons for job categories and series where underrepresentation prevails, according to the national determinations and the determinations made by each agency under these guidelines.</P>
              <P>b. Further, OPM should work with Federal agencies to develop effective mechanisms for providing information on Federal job opportunities, targeted to reach Federal employees from underrepresented groups in all agencies in order to broaden the applicant pool.</P>
              <P>V. <E T="03">Consistency with Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978.</E> A. The Office shall develop regulations and implement this program in consultation with the Commission and with other affected agencies in such manner that their recruitment programs may be incorporated as a consistent and effective element of the agencies' national and regional equal employment opportunity plans. Each agency is required to implement such plans under the direction and guidance of the Commission in accordance with Section 717 of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and Executive Order 12067.</P>
              <P>B. Procedures shall be established by OPM and the Commission to assure appropriate consultation in development of the regulations.</P>
              <P>C. Pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 1 and to Executive Order 12067 issued thereunder, the Commission will establish procedures to provide appropriate consultation and review of the program on a continuing basis, to maximize its effectiveness and eliminate any duplication, conflict or inconsistency in requirements for equal opportunity programs in the Federal agencies.</P>
              <P>D. In preparing its annual report to the Congress pursuant to the Act, OPM should do so in consultation with the Commission.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>

            <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant <PRTPAGE P="20"/>historic features of an historic property; or</P>
            <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 723.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 723.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 723.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
            <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
            <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>

            <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;<PRTPAGE P="21"/>

            <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
            <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>

The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
            <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 723.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">No Fear Act Notice</HD>
                <P>On May 15, 2002, Congress enacted the “Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002,” which is now known as the No FEAR Act. One purpose of the Act is to “require that Federal agencies be accountable for violations of antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection laws.” Public Law 107-174, Summary. In support of this purpose, Congress found that “agencies cannot be run effectively if those agencies practice or tolerate discrimination.” Public Law 107-174, Title I, General Provisions, section 101(1).</P>

                <P>The Act also requires this agency to provide this notice to Federal employees, former Federal employees and applicants for Federal employment to inform you of the rights and protections available to you under <PRTPAGE P="25"/>Federal antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection laws.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Antidiscrimination Laws</HD>
                <P>A Federal agency cannot discriminate against an employee or applicant with respect to the terms, conditions or privileges of employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status or political affiliation. Discrimination on these bases is prohibited by one or more of the following statutes: 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), 29 U.S.C. 206(d), 29 U.S.C. 631, 29 U.S.C. 633a, 29 U.S.C. 791 and 42 U.S.C. 2000e-16.</P>

                <P>If you believe that you have been the victim of unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin or disability, you must contact an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor within 45 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory action, or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 calendar days of the effective date of the action, before you can file a formal complaint of discrimination with your agency. <E T="03">See, e.g.</E> 29 CFR 1614. If you believe that you have been the victim of unlawful discrimination on the basis of age, you must either contact an EEO counselor as noted above or give notice of intent to sue to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory action. If you are alleging discrimination based on marital status or political affiliation, you may file a written complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) (<E T="03">see</E> contact information below). In the alternative (or in some cases, in addition), you may pursue a discrimination complaint by filing a grievance through your agency's administrative or negotiated grievance procedures, if such procedures apply and are available.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Whistleblower Protection Laws</HD>
                <P>A Federal employee with authority to take, direct others to take, recommend or approve any personnel action must not use that authority to take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action against an employee or applicant because of disclosure of information by that individual that is reasonably believed to evidence violations of law, rule or regulation; gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, unless disclosure of such information is specifically prohibited by law and such information is specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.</P>

                <P>Retaliation against an employee or applicant for making a protected disclosure is prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8). If you believe that you have been the victim of whistleblower retaliation, you may file a written complaint (Form OSC-11) with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel at 1730 M Street NW., Suite 218, Washington, DC 20036-4505 or online through the OSC Web site—<E T="03">http://www.osc.gov.</E>
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Retaliation for Engaging in Protected Activity</HD>
                <P>A Federal agency cannot retaliate against an employee or applicant because that individual exercises his or her rights under any of the Federal antidiscrimination or whistleblower protection laws listed above. If you believe that you are the victim of retaliation for engaging in protected activity, you must follow, as appropriate, the procedures described in the Antidiscrimination Laws and Whistleblower Protection Laws sections or, if applicable, the administrative or negotiated grievance procedures in order to pursue any legal remedy.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Disciplinary Actions</HD>
                <P>Under the existing laws, each agency retains the right, where appropriate, to discipline a Federal employee for conduct that is inconsistent with Federal Antidiscrimination and Whistleblower Protection Laws up to and including removal. If OSC has initiated an investigation under 5 U.S.C. 1214, however, according to 5 U.S.C. 1214(f), agencies must seek approval from the Special Counsel to discipline employees for, among other activities, engaging in prohibited retaliation. Nothing in the No FEAR Act alters existing laws or permits an agency to take unfounded disciplinary action against a Federal employee or to violate the procedural rights of a Federal employee who has been accused of discrimination</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Additional Information</HD>

                <P>For further information regarding the No FEAR Act regulations, refer to 5 CFR part 724, as well as the appropriate offices within your agency (e.g., EEO/civil rights office, human resources office or legal office). Additional information regarding Federal antidiscrimination, whistleblower protection and retaliation laws can be found at the EEOC Web site—<E T="03">http://www.eeoc.gov</E> and the OSC Web site—<E T="03">http://www.osc.gov.</E>

              <P>(d) Each agency is <E T="03">encouraged</E> to implement its training as soon as possible, but <E T="03">required</E> to complete the initial training under this subpart for all employees (including supervisors and managers) by December 17, 2006.

              <P>(e) After the initial training is completed, each agency must train new employees as part of its agency orientation program or other training program. Any agency that does not use a new employee orientation program for this purpose must train new employees within 90 calendar days of the new employees' appointment.</P>

              <P>(a) The purpose of this part is to establish criteria and procedures for making determinations of suitability and for taking suitability actions regarding employment in covered positions (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3301, E.O. 10577 (3 CFR, 1954-1958 Comp., p. 218), as amended, and 5 CFR 1.1, 2.1(a) and 5.2. Section 3301 of title 5, United States Code, directs consideration of “age, health, character, knowledge, and ability for the employment sought.” E.O. 10577 (codified in relevant part at 5 CFR 1.1, 2.1(a) and 5.2) directs OPM to examine “suitability” for competitive Federal employment. This part concerns only determinations of “suitability,” that is, those determinations based on a person's character or conduct that may have an impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service. Determinations made and actions taken under this part are distinct from objections to eligibles or pass overs of preference eligibles, and OPM's and agencies' decisions on such requests, made under 5 U.S.C. 3318 and 5 CFR 332.406, as well as determinations of eligibility for assignment to, or retention in, sensitive national security positions made under E.O. 10450 (3 CFR, <PRTPAGE P="30"/>1949-1953 Comp., p. 936), E.O. 12968, or similar authorities.</P>

              <P>(a) Subject to the limitations and requirements of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, OPM delegates to the heads of agencies authority for making suitability determinations and taking suitability actions (including limited, agency-specific debarments under § 731.205) in cases involving <E T="03">applicants</E> for and <E T="03">appointees</E> to covered positions in the agency.</P>
              <P>(b) When an agency, acting under delegated authority from OPM, determines that a Governmentwide debarment by OPM under § 731.204(a) may be an appropriate action, it must refer the case to OPM for debarment consideration. Agencies must make these referrals prior to any proposed suitability action, but only after sufficient resolution of the suitability issue(s), through subject contact or investigation, to determine if a Governmentwide debarment appears warranted.</P>
              <P>(c) Agencies exercising authority under this part by delegation from OPM must adhere to OPM requirements as stated in this part and OPM's issuances described in § 731.102(c). Agencies must also implement policies and maintain records demonstrating that they employ reasonable methods to ensure adherence to these OPM issuances.</P>

              <P>(d)(1) A hiring agency may not make specific inquiries concerning an applicant's criminal or credit background of the sort asked on the OF-306 or other forms used to conduct suitability investigations for Federal employment (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> inquiries into an applicant's criminal or adverse credit history) unless the hiring agency has made a conditional offer of employment to the applicant. Agencies may make inquiries <PRTPAGE P="31"/>into an applicant's Selective Service registration, military service, citizenship status, or previous work history, prior to making a conditional offer of employment to an applicant. However, in certain situations, agencies may have a business need to obtain information about the suitability or background of applicants earlier in the process. If so, agencies must request an exception from the Office of Personnel Management, in accordance with the provisions of 5 CFR part 330 subpart M.</P>
              <P>(2) OPM reserves the right to undertake a determination of suitability based upon evidence of falsification or fraud relating to an examination or appointment at any point when information giving rise to such a charge is discovered. OPM must be informed in all cases where there is evidence of material, intentional false statements, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment, and OPM will take a suitability action where warranted.</P>
              <P>(e) When an agency, exercising authority under this part by delegation from OPM, makes a suitability determination or changes a tentative favorable placement decision to an unfavorable decision, based on an OPM report of investigation or upon an investigation conducted pursuant to OPM-delegated authority, the agency must:</P>
              <P>(1) Ensure that the records used in making the determination are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure fairness to the person in any determination;</P>
              <P>(2) Ensure that all applicable administrative procedural requirements provided by law, the regulations in this part, and OPM issuances as described in § 731.102(c) have been observed;</P>
              <P>(3) Consider all available information in reaching its final decision on a suitability determination or suitability action, except information furnished by a non-corroborated confidential source, which may be used only for limited purposes, such as information used to develop a lead or in interrogatories to a subject, if the identity of the source is not compromised in any way; and</P>
              <P>(4) Keep any record of the agency suitability determination or action as required by OPM issuances as described in § 731.102(c).</P>
              <P>(f) OPM may revoke an agency's delegation to make suitability determinations and take suitability actions under this part if an agency fails to conform to this part or OPM issuances as described in § 731.102(c).</P>
              <P>(g) OPM retains jurisdiction to make final determinations and take actions in all suitability cases where there is evidence that there has been a material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. OPM also retains jurisdiction over all suitability cases involving a refusal to furnish testimony as required by § 5.4 of this chapter. Agencies must refer these cases to OPM for suitability determinations and suitability actions under this authority. Although no prior approval is needed, notification to OPM is required if the agency wants to take, or has taken, action under its own authority (5 CFR part 315, 5 CFR part 359, or 5 CFR part 752) in cases involving material, intentional false statement in examination or appointment, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment; or refusal to furnish testimony as required by § 5.4 of this title. In addition, paragraph (a) of this section notwithstanding, OPM may, in its discretion, exercise its jurisdiction under this part in any case it deems necessary.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Appointments subject to investigation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To establish a person's suitability for employment, appointments to covered positions identified in § 731.101 require the person to undergo an investigation by OPM or by an agency with delegated authority from OPM to conduct investigations. However, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2), an appointment will not be subject to investigation when the person being appointed has undergone a background investigation and the appointment involves:</P>

              <P>(1) Appointment or conversion to an appointment in a covered position if the person has been serving continuously with the agency for at least 1 year in one or more covered positions subject to investigation;<PRTPAGE P="32"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Transfer to a covered position, provided the person has been serving continuously for at least 1 year in a covered position subject to investigation;</P>
              <P>(3) Transfer or appointment from an excepted service position that is not a covered position to a covered position, provided the person has been serving continuously for at least 1 year in a position where the person has been determined fit for appointment based on criteria equivalent to the factors provided at 5 CFR 731.202;</P>
              <P>(4) Appointment to a covered position from a position as an employee working as a Federal Government contract employee, provided the person has been serving continuously for at least 1 year in a job where a Federal agency determined the contract employee was fit to perform work on the contract based on criteria equivalent to the factors provided at 5 CFR 731.202; or</P>
              <P>(5) Appointment to a covered position where there has been a break in service of less than 24 months, and the service immediately preceding the break was in a covered position, an excepted service position, or a contract employee position described in paragraphs (a)(1) to (a)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Either OPM or an agency with delegated suitability authority may investigate and take a suitability action against an applicant, appointee, or employee in accordance with § 731.105. There is no time limit on the authority of OPM or an agency with delegated suitability authority to conduct the required investigation of an applicant who has been appointed to a position. An employee does not have to serve a new probationary or trial period merely because his or her appointment is subject to investigation under this section. An employee's probationary or trial period is not extended because his or her appointment is subject to investigation under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) An appointment to a covered position also will be subject to investigation when:</P>
              <P>(i) The covered position requires a higher level of investigation than previously conducted for the person being appointed; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An agency obtains new information in connection with the person's appointment that calls into question the person's suitability under § 731.202;</P>
              <P>(3) Suitability determinations must be made for all appointments that are subject to investigation.</P>
              <P>(c) Positions that are intermittent, seasonal, per diem, or temporary, not to exceed an aggregate of 180 days per year in either a single continuous appointment or series of appointments, do not require a background investigation as described in § 731.106(c)(1). The employing agency, however, must conduct such checks as it deems appropriate to ensure the suitability of the person.</P>
              <P>(d) Reinvestigation requirements under § 731.106 for public trust positions are not affected by this section.</P>
              <P>(e) For purposes of this section, “criteria equivalent to the factors provided at 5 CFR 731.202” are criteria that provide adequate assurance that the person to be appointed, converted to an appointment, or transferred is suitable to be employed in a covered position, as determined by OPM, in issuances under this regulation. A decision by OPM, or by an agency applying guidance from OPM, that a prior fitness determination was not based on criteria equivalent to the factors provided at 5 CFR 731.202, and that a new investigation or adjudication is necessary is not subject to review under section 731.501 of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) Neither OPM nor an agency acting under delegated authority may take a suitability action in connection with any application for, or appointment to, a position that is not subject to investigation or check under § 731.104.</P>

              <P>(b) OPM may take a suitability action under this part against an <E T="03">applicant</E> or <E T="03">appointee</E> based on any of the criteria of § 731.202;</P>

              <P>(c) Except as limited by § 731.103(g), an agency, exercising delegated authority, may take a suitability action under this part against an <E T="03">applicant</E> or <E T="03">appointee</E> based on the criteria of § 731.202;<PRTPAGE P="33"/>
              </P>

              <P>(d) OPM may take a suitability action under this part against an <E T="03">employee</E> based on the criteria of § 731.202(b)(3), (4), or (8).</P>

              <P>(e) An agency may not take a suitability action against an <E T="03">employee.</E> Nothing in this part precludes an agency from taking an adverse action against an employee under the procedures and standards of part 752 of this chapter or terminating a probationary employee under the procedures of part 315 or part 359 of this chapter. An agency must notify OPM to the extent required in § 731.103(g) if it wants to take, or has taken, action under these authorities.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Designation of public trust positions and investigative requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Risk designation.</E> Agency heads must designate every covered position within the agency at a high, moderate, or low risk level as determined by the position's potential for adverse impact to the efficiency or integrity of the service. OPM will provide an example of a risk designation system for agency use in an OPM issuance as described in § 731.102(c).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Public Trust positions.</E> Positions at the high or moderate risk levels would normally be designated as “Public Trust” positions. Such positions may involve policy making, major program responsibility, public safety and health, law enforcement duties, fiduciary responsibilities or other duties demanding a significant degree of public trust, and positions involving access to or operation or control of financial records, with a significant risk for causing damage or realizing personal gain.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Investigative requirements.</E> (1) Persons receiving an appointment made subject to investigation under this part must undergo a background investigation. OPM is authorized to establish minimum investigative requirements correlating to risk levels. Investigations should be initiated before appointment but no later than 14 calendar days after placement in the position.</P>
              <P>(2) All positions subject to investigation under this part must also receive a sensitivity designation of Special-Sensitive, Critical-Sensitive, or Noncritical-Sensitive, when appropriate. This designation is complementary to the risk designation, and may have an effect on the position's investigative requirement. Sections 732.201 and 732.202 of this chapter detail the various sensitivity levels and investigative requirements. Procedures for determining investigative requirements for all positions based upon risk and sensitivity will be published in OPM issuances, as described in §§ 731.102(c) and 732.201(b).</P>
              <P>(3) If suitability issues develop prior to the required investigation, OPM or the agency may conduct an investigation sufficient to resolve the issues and support a suitability determination or action, if warranted. If the person is appointed, the minimum level of investigation must be conducted as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reinvestigation requirements.</E> (1) Agencies must ensure that reinvestigations are conducted and a determination made regarding continued employment of persons occupying public trust positions at least once every 5 years. The nature of these reinvestigations and any additional requirements and parameters will be established in supplemental guidance issued by OPM.</P>
              <P>(2) If, prior to the next required reinvestigation, a separate investigation is conducted to determine a person's eligibility (or continued eligibility) for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position, or as a result of a change in risk level as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, and that investigation meets or exceeds the requirements for a public trust reinvestigation, a new public trust reinvestigation is not required. Such a completed investigation restarts the cycle for a public trust reinvestigation for that person.</P>
              <P>(3) Agencies must notify all employees covered by this section of the reinvestigation requirements under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Risk level changes.</E> If an employee or appointee experiences a change to a higher position risk level due to promotion, demotion, or reassignment, or the risk level of the employee's or appointee's position is changed to a higher level, the employee or appointee <PRTPAGE P="34"/>may remain in or encumber the position. Any upgrade in the investigation required for the new risk level should be initiated within 14 calendar days after the promotion, demotion, reassignment or new designation of risk level is final.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Completed investigations.</E> Any suitability investigation (or reinvestigation) completed by an agency under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section must result in a determination by the employing agency of whether the findings of the investigation would justify an action under this part or under another applicable authority, such as part 315, 359, or 752 of this chapter. Section 731.103 addresses whether an agency may take an action under this part, and whether the matter must be referred to OPM for debarment consideration.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> OPM, or an agency to which OPM has delegated authority, must base its suitability determination on the presence or absence of one or more of the specific factors (charges) in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific factors.</E> In determining whether a person is suitable for Federal employment, only the following factors will be considered a basis for finding a person unsuitable and taking a suitability action:</P>
              <P>(1) Misconduct or negligence in employment;</P>
              <P>(2) Criminal or dishonest conduct;</P>
              <P>(3) Material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment;</P>

              <P>(5) Alcohol abuse, without evidence of substantial rehabilitation, of a nature and duration that suggests that the applicant or appointee would be prevented from performing the duties of the position in question, or would constitute a direct threat to the property or safety of the applicant or appointee or others;</P>
              <P>(6) Illegal use of narcotics, drugs, or other controlled substances without evidence of substantial rehabilitation;</P>
              <P>(7) Knowing and willful engagement in acts or activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force; and</P>
              <P>(8) Any statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the lawful employment of the person involved in the position in question.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional considerations.</E> OPM and agencies must consider any of the following additional considerations to the extent OPM or the relevant agency, in its sole discretion, deems any of them pertinent to the individual case:</P>
              <P>(1) The nature of the position for which the person is applying or in which the person is employed;</P>
              <P>(2) The nature and seriousness of the conduct;</P>
              <P>(3) The circumstances surrounding the conduct;</P>
              <P>(4) The recency of the conduct;</P>
              <P>(5) The age of the person involved at the time of the conduct;</P>
              <P>(6) Contributing societal conditions; and</P>
              <P>(7) The absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reciprocity.</E> An agency cannot make a new determination under this section for a person who has already been determined suitable or fit based on character or conduct unless a new investigation is required under § 731.104 or § 731.106, or no new investigation is required but the investigative record on file for the person shows conduct that is incompatible with the core duties of the relevant covered position.</P>

              <P>(c) A suitability action may be taken against an applicant or an appointee when OPM or an agency exercising delegated authority under this part finds that the applicant or appointee is unsuitable for the reasons cited in § 731.202, subject to the agency limitations of § 731.103(g).</P>
              <P>(d) OPM may require that an appointee or an employee be removed on the basis of a material, intentional false statement, deception or fraud in examination or appointment; refusal to furnish testimony as required by § 5.4 of this chapter; or a statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the person's lawful employment.</P>
              <P>(e) OPM may cancel any reinstatement eligibility obtained as a result of a material, intentional false statement, deception or fraud in examination or appointment.</P>
              <P>(f) An action to remove an appointee or employee <E T="03">for suitability reasons</E> under this part is not an action under part 315, 359, or 752 of this chapter.

An agency must notify OPM to the extent required in § 731.103(g) if it wants to take, or has taken, action under these authorities.</P>
              <P>(g) Agencies do not need approval from OPM before taking unfavorable suitability actions. However, they are required to report to OPM all unfavorable suitability actions taken under this part within 30 days after they take the action. Also, all actions based on an OPM investigation must be reported to OPM as soon as possible and in no event later than 90 days after receipt of the final report of investigation.</P>

              <P>(b) The agency may impose an additional period of debarment following the expiration of a period of OPM or agency debarment, but only after the person again becomes an applicant or appointee subject to the agency's suitability jurisdiction, and his or her suitability is determined in accordance with the procedures of this part.

              <SUBJECT>Allocation and reimbursement of costs associated with political activities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The costs associated with the political activities described in § 733.502(c) of this chapter may not be paid for by money derived from the Treasury of the United States. Costs associated with a political activity are deemed not to be paid for by money derived from the Treasury of the United States if the Treasury is reimbursed for the costs within a reasonable period of time.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purposes of this section, costs associated with a political activity do not include any costs that the Government would have or have incurred regardless of whether the activity was political. Examples of such costs are:</P>
              <P>(1) The compensation of the employee described in § 734.502(a);</P>
              <P>(2) The value of any office or other real property owned or leased by the Government;</P>
              <P>(3) The compensation and expenses of any Government employee that is required in the performance of his or her duties to accompany or assist the person engaging in the political activity; and</P>
              <P>(4) The cost of special security arrangements for the person engaging in the political activity, including special transportation vehicles or methods.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) An employee covered under this subpart must apportion the costs of mixed travel based on the time spent on political activities and the time spent performing official duties. Prorating the cost of travel involves determining the “total activity time” which is the amount of time actually spent by the employee in meetings, receptions, rallies, and similar activities. Time spent in actual travel, private study, or rest and recreation is not included in the computation of the “total activity time”. The proration of the cost then is determined based on how the “total activity time” was spent. The formula is as follows:

              <EXTRACT>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Time spent in official meetings, receptions, etc. + Time spent in political meetings, receptions, rallies = Total activity time</FP>

                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">The percentage figure that represents the political portion of the trip is then multiplied by the amount that would be reimbursed to the Government if all of the travel was political.

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Agency decision.</E> (1) In arriving at its decision, the agency will consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action and any answer of the employee or his or her representative, or both, made to a designated official.</P>

              <P>(a) An agency may take an adverse action, including a performance-based adverse action or an indefinite suspension, under this subpart only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.</P>
              <P>(b) An agency may not take an adverse action against an employee on the basis of any reason prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 2302.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Statutory entitlements.</E> An employee against whom action is proposed under this subpart is entitled to the procedures provided in 5 U.S.C. 7513(b).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of proposed action.</E> (1) An employee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to at least 30 days' advance written notice unless there is an exception pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The notice must state the specific reason(s) for the proposed action, and inform the employee of his or her right to review the material which is relied on to support the reasons for action given in the notice.</P>
              <P>(2) When some but not all employees in a given competitive level are being furloughed, the notice of proposed action must state the basis for selecting a particular employee for furlough, as well as the reasons for the furlough.</P>
              <P>(3) Under ordinary circumstances, an employee whose removal or suspension, including indefinite suspension, has been proposed will remain in a duty status in his or her regular position during the advance notice period. In those rare circumstances where the agency determines that the employee's continued presence in the workplace during the notice period may pose a threat to the employee or others, result in loss of or damage to Government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests, the agency may elect one or a combination of the following alternatives:</P>
              <P>(i) Assigning the employee to duties where he or she is no longer a threat to safety, the agency mission, or to Government property;</P>
              <P>(ii) Allowing the employee to take leave, or carrying him or her in an appropriate leave status (annual, sick, leave without pay, or absence without leave) if the employee has absented himself or herself from the worksite without requesting leave;</P>
              <P>(iii) Curtailing the notice period when the agency can invoke the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Placing the employee in a paid, nonduty status for such time as is necessary to effect the action.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Employee's answer.</E> (1) An employee may answer orally and in writing except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The agency must give the employee a reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied on to support its proposed action, to prepare an answer orally and in writing, and to secure affidavits, if the employee is in an active duty status. The agency may require the employee to furnish any answer to the proposed action, and affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer, within such time as would be reasonable, but not less than 7 days.</P>
              <P>(2) The agency will designate an official to hear the employee's oral answer who has authority either to make or recommend a final decision on the proposed adverse action. The right to answer orally in person does not include the right to a formal hearing with examination of witnesses unless the agency provides for such hearing in its regulations. Under 5 U.S.C. 7513(c), the agency may, in its regulations, provide a hearing in place of or in addition to the opportunity for written and oral answer.</P>

              <P>(3) If the employee wishes the agency to consider any medical condition which may contribute to a conduct, performance, or leave problem, the employee must be given a reasonable time to furnish medical documentation (as defined in § 339.104 of this chapter) of the condition. Whenever possible, the <PRTPAGE P="69"/>employee will supply such documentation within the time limits allowed for an answer.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> (1) Section 7513(b) of title 5, U.S. Code, authorizes an exception to the 30 days' advance written notice when the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed and is proposing a removal or suspension, including indefinite suspension. This notice exception is commonly referred to as the “crime provision.” This provision may be invoked even in the absence of judicial action.</P>
              <P>(2) The advance written notice and opportunity to answer are not required for furlough without pay due to unforeseeable circumstances, such as sudden breakdowns in equipment, acts of God, or sudden emergencies requiring immediate curtailment of activities.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Representation.</E> Section 7513(b)(3) of title 5, U.S. Code, provides that an employee covered by this part is entitled to be represented by an attorney or other representative. An agency may disallow as an employee's representative an individual whose activities as representative would cause a conflict of interest or position, or an employee of the agency whose release from his or her official position would give rise to unreasonable costs or whose priority work assignments preclude his or her release.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Agency review of medical information.</E> When medical information is supplied by the employee pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the agency may, if authorized, require a medical examination under the criteria of § 339.301 of this chapter, or otherwise, at its option, offer a medical examination in accordance with the criteria of § 339.302 of this chapter. If the employee has the requisite years of service under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees' Retirement System, the agency must provide information concerning disability retirement. The agency must be aware of the affirmative obligations of the provisions of 29 CFR 1614.203, which require reasonable accommodation of a qualified individual with a disability.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Agency decision.</E> (1) In arriving at its decision, the agency will consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action and any answer of the employee or his or her representative, or both, made to a designated official and any medical documentation reviewed under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The notice must specify in writing the reasons for the decision and advise the employee of any appeal or grievance rights under § 752.405 of this part. The agency must deliver the notice of decision to the employee on or before the effective date of the action.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Applications for disability retirement.</E> Section 831.1204(e) of this chapter provides that an employee's application for disability retirement need not delay any other appropriate personnel action. Section 831.1205 and § 844.202 of this chapter set forth the basis under which an agency must file an application for disability retirement on behalf of an employee.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Grievance rights.</E> As provided at 5 U.S.C. 7121(e)(1), if a matter covered by this subpart falls within the coverage of an applicable negotiated grievance procedure, an employee may elect to file a grievance under that procedure or appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under 5 U.S.C. 7701, but not both. Sections 7114(a)(5) and 7121(b)(1)(C) of title 5, U.S. Code, and the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement, govern representation for employees in an exclusive bargaining unit who grieve a matter under this subpart through the negotiated grievance procedure.</P>

              <P>When an employee or applicant for employment appeals an action to MSPB and the appeal results in an initial decision by an MSPB administrative judge granting interim relief under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A) and a petition for review of the initial decision is filed (or will be filed) with the full Board under 5 U.S.C. 7701(e)(1)(A), the agency shall provide the relief ordered in the initial decision by taking an interim personnel action subject to the following terms:</P>
              <P>(a) Interim personnel actions shall be made effective upon the date of issuance of the initial decision and must be initiated on or before the date of a petition for review by the agency or within a reasonable period after the date it becomes aware of a petition for review by the appellant;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Computation of interest.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The computation of interest is on the basis of 30 days to the month. Interest is computed for the actual calendar time involved in each case, but whenever applicable the rule of average applies.</P>
              <P>(b) Interest is allowed on current deductions and deposits at the rate of 4 percent per year to December 31, 1947, and 3 percent per year thereafter, compounded annually, to December 31, 1956. After December 31, 1956, except as provided below, interest is allowed at the rate of 3 percent per year, compounded annually, to date of final separation or transfer to a position that is not covered by the retirement system. After December 31, 1956, interest is not allowed:</P>
              <P>(1) When an employee has one year or less of covered service,</P>
              <P>(2) For any fractional part of a month in the total service, or</P>
              <P>(3) For more than five years' civilian service.</P>
              <P>(c) Interest at the rate of 3 percent per year through December 31, 1984, and, thereafter, at the yearly rate determined by the Secretary of Treasury, compounded annually, is allowed on voluntary contributions during periods of employment and, after the employee or Member has completed at least 5 years' civilian service, during periods of separation until the beginning date of annuity or death, whichever is earlier. For refund purposes, however, interest on voluntary contributions terminates on the date of the employee's or Member's final separation or on the date of the employee's or Member's last transfer to a position in which he or she is not subject to subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code</P>
              <P>(d) For noncontributory service performed before October 1, 1982, and for redeposits of refunds paid on an application received by either the individual's employing agency or OPM before October 1, 1982, interest at the rate of 4 percent per year to December 31, 1947, and at the rate of 3 percent per year thereafter, compounded annually, is charged. Interest is charged on the outstanding balance of a deposit from the midpoint of each service period for which deposit is involved; interest is charged on the outstanding balance of a refund from the date the refund was paid. Interest is charged to the date of deposit or commencing date of annuity, whichever is earlier, except that interest is not charged for any period of separation from the service which began before October 1, 1956.</P>

              <P>(e) For noncontributory service performed on or after October 1, 1982, and for redeposits of refunds paid on an application received by the individual's employing agency or OPM on or after October 1, 1982, interest is charged at <PRTPAGE P="82"/>the rate of 3 percent per year through December 31, 1984, and, thereafter, at the yearly rate determined by the Secretary of Treasury, compounded annually. Interest is charged on the outstanding balance of a deposit from the midpoint of each service period for which deposit is involved; interest is charged on the outstanding balance of a refund from the date the refund was paid. Interest is charged to the date of deposit.</P>
              <P>(f) No interest is charged on a deposit for military service if that deposit is made before October 1, 1984, or within 2 years of the date that an individual first becomes an employee or Member under the civil service retirement system, whichever is later. When interest is charged on a deposit for military service, it is charged on the outstanding balance at the rate of 3 percent per year, compounded annually, from October 1, 1984, or 2 years from the date the individual first becomes an employee or Member, whichever is later, through December 31, 1984, and thereafter at the yearly rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.</P>

              <P>(g) For calendar year 1985 and for each subsequent calendar year, OPM will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to notify the public of the interest rate that will be in effect during that calendar year.</P>
              <P>(h) Interest under §§ 831.631, 831.632, 831.682, and 831.684 is compounded annually and accrued monthly.</P>
              <P>(1) The initial interest on each monthly difference between the reduced annuity rate and the annuity rate actually paid equals the amount of the monthly difference times the difference between (i) 1.06 raised to the power whose numerator is the number of months between the date when the monthly difference in annuity rates occurred and the date when the initial interest is computed and whose denominator is 12; and (ii) 1.</P>
              <P>(2) The total initial interest due is the sum of all of the initial interest on each monthly difference computed in accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Additional interest on any uncollected balance will be compounded annually and accrued monthly. The additional interest due each month equals the remaining balance due times the difference between (i) 1.06 raised to the 1/12th power; and (ii) 1.</P>
              <P>(i)(1) When an individual's civilian service involves several deposit and/or redeposit periods, OPM will normally use the following order of precedence in applying each installment payment against the full amount due:</P>
              <P>(i) Redeposits of refunds paid on applications received by the individual's employing agency or OPM on or after October 1, 1982;</P>
              <P>(ii) Redeposits of refunds paid on applications received by the individual's employing agency or OPM before October 1, 1982;</P>
              <P>(iii) Deposits for noncontributory civilian service performed on or after October 1, 1982; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Deposits for noncontributory service performed before October 1, 1982.</P>
              <P>(2) If an individual specifically requests a different order of precedence, that request will be honored.</P>
              <P>(j) Interest under § 831.662 is compounded annually and accrued monthly.</P>
              <P>(1) The initial interest on each monthly difference between the reduced annuity rate and the annuity rate actually paid equals the amount of the monthly difference times the difference between—</P>
              <P>(i) The sum of one plus the interest rate set under § 831.105(g) raised to the power whose numerator is the number of months between the date when the monthly difference in annuity rates occurred and the date when the initial interest is computed and whose denominator is 12; and</P>
              <P>(ii) 1.</P>
              <P>(2) The total initial interest due is the sum of all of the initial interest on each monthly difference computed in accordance with paragraph (j)(1) of this section.</P>

The agency must submit as the agency share, a payment equal to the amount that would have been submitted if the error had not been made (or a payment equal to the difference between the amount already submitted as the agency share <PRTPAGE P="85"/>and the amount that should have been submitted). The payment should be submitted to OPM in the manner currently prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards established by OPM.</P>

              <P>(i) Request the agency that employed him or her when the error was made to correct his or her records and arrange to pay any resulting overpayment of pay to the agency (unless it is waived by the agency); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Pay the deposit plus any applicable interest (under certain conditions, the deposit may be made at any time until the final adjudication of his or her application for retirement) directly to OPM by submitting SF 2803; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Have the period of service treated like the nondeduction service described in § 831.303.</P>
              <P>(2) When the agency withholds part of the required employee deductions for any pay period, the balance must be submitted to OPM in the manner currently prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards established by OPM. The agency must correct its error. The employee does not have the option to pay a deposit directly to OPM when partial deductions have been withheld.</P>
              <P>(3) If the agency waives the employee's repayment of the salary overpayment that resulted from the administrative error, the agency must also submit (in addition to the agency contribution) the employee's share of the unpaid contributions to OPM in the manner currently prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions.</P>

              <P>(1) A person currently employed in a position subject to the civil service retirement law; or</P>
              <P>(2) A former employee (whose annuity has not been finally adjudicated) who retains civil service retirement annuity rights based on a separation from a position in which retirement deductions were properly withheld and remain (or have been redeposited in whole or in part) in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determinations involving the payment of survivor benefits at an employee's or former employee's death.</E> To determine entitlement to survivor benefits, OPM establishes whether the deceased individual was an “employee” or a “retiree” on the date of death. If the decedent was an “employee” on the date of death, survivor benefits are paid as though the individual died in service. If the decedent was a “retiree” on the date of death, survivor benefits are only paid as provided in the individual's election, provided it was properly made. However, if a former employee was eligible only for a deferred annuity at age 62, survivor benefits are only paid if the individual was a “retiree” on the date of death. For purposes of this paragraph—</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Employee</E> is a person—</P>

              <P>(ii) Whose death occurs before the commencing date of annuity, even though separation has occurred.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Retiree</E> or <E T="03">annuitant</E> is a person—</P>

              <P>(ii) Whose death occurs on or after the commencing date of annuity.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determinations involving the requirement of spousal consent for elections of alternative annuity and survivor annuity benefits.</E> Spousal consent is required as specified in §§ 831.614 and 831.2203(c), <PRTPAGE P="86"/>if the employee/annuitant is married on the commencing date of annuity, regardless of whether that date is before or after the date of separation from service.</P>

              <P>(a) A <E T="03">specific designee</E> is defined as a senior official within an agency who has been specifically designated to sign requests for voluntary early retirement authority under a designation from the head of the agency. Examples include a Chief Human Capital Officer, an Assistant Secretary for Administration, a Director of Human Resources Management, or other official.</P>
              <P>(b) An agency's request for voluntary early retirement authority must be signed by the head of the agency or by a specific designee.</P>
              <P>(c) The request must contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) Identification of the agency or specified component(s) for which the authority is being requested;</P>
              <P>(2) Reasons why the agency needs voluntary early retirement authority. This must include a detailed summary of the agency's personnel and/or budgetary situation that will result in an excess of personnel because of a substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring or reshaping, consistent with agency human capital goals;</P>
              <P>(3) The date on which the agency expects to effect the substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring or reshaping;</P>
              <P>(4) The time period during which the agency plans to offer voluntary early retirement;</P>
              <P>(5) The total number of non-temporary employees in the agency (or specified component(s));</P>
              <P>(6) The total number of non-temporary employees in the agency (or specified component(s)) who may be involuntarily separated, downgraded, transferred, or reassigned as a result of the substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring or reshaping;</P>
              <P>(7) The total number of employees in the agency (or specified component(s)) who are eligible for voluntary early retirement;</P>
              <P>(8) An estimate of the total number of employees in the agency (or specified component(s)) who are expected to retire early during the period covered by the request for voluntary early retirement authority; and</P>
              <P>(9) A description of the types of personnel actions anticipated as a result of the agency's need for voluntary early retirement authority. Examples include separations, transfers, reassignments, and downgradings.</P>
              <P>(d) OPM will evaluate a request for voluntary early retirement based on:</P>
              <P>(1) A specific request to OPM from the agency for voluntary early retirement authority;</P>
              <P>(2) A voluntary separation incentive payment implementation plan, as discussed in part 576, subpart A, of this chapter, which must outline the intended use of the incentive payments and voluntary early retirement; or</P>
              <P>(3) The agency's human capital plan, which must outline its intended use of voluntary separation incentive payments and voluntary early retirement authority, and the changes in organizational structure it expects to make as the result of projected separations and early retirements.</P>
              <P>(e) Regardless of the method used, the request must include all of the information required by paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(f) OPM may approve an agency's request for voluntary early retirement authority to cover the entire period of the substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of <PRTPAGE P="87"/>function, or other workforce restructuring or reshaping described by the agency, or the initial portion of that period with a requirement for subsequent information and justification if the period covers multiple years.</P>
              <P>(g) After OPM approves an agency's request, the agency must immediately notify OPM of any subsequent changes in the conditions that served as the basis for the approval of the voluntary early retirement authority. Depending upon the circumstances involved, OPM will modify the authority as necessary to better suit the agency's needs.</P>
              <P>(h) The agency may further limit voluntary early retirement offers based on:</P>
              <P>(1) An established opening and closing date for the acceptance of applications that is announced to employees at the time of the offer; or</P>
              <P>(2) The acceptance of a specified number of applications for voluntary early retirement, provided that, at the time of the offer, the agency notified employees that it retained the right to limit the number of voluntary early retirements.</P>
              <P>(i) Within the timeframe specified for its approved voluntary early retirement authority, the agency may subsequently establish a new or revised closing date, or reduce or increase the number of early retirement applications it will accept, if management's downsizing and/or reshaping needs change. If the agency issues a revised closing date, or a revised number of applications to be accepted, the new date or number of applications must be announced to the same group of employees included in the original announcement. If the agency issues a new window period with a new closing date, or a new instance of a specific number of applications to be accepted, the new window period or number of applications to be accepted may be announced to a different group of employees as long as they are covered by the approved voluntary early retirement authority.</P>
              <P>(j) Chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, requires that agencies treat employees on military duty, for all practical purposes, as though they were still on the job. Further, employees are not to be disadvantaged because of their military service. In accordance with these provisions, employees on military duty who would otherwise be eligible for an offer of voluntary early retirement will have 30 days following their return to duty to either accept or reject an offer of voluntary early retirement. This will be true even if the voluntary early retirement authority provided by OPM has expired.</P>
              <P>(k) An employee who separates from the service voluntarily after completing 25 years of service, or becoming age 50 and completing 20 years of service, is entitled to an annuity if, on the date of separation, the employee:</P>
              <P>(1) Is serving in a position covered by a voluntary early retirement offer; and</P>
              <P>(2) Meets the following conditions which are covered in 5 U.S.C. 8336(d)(2):</P>
              <P>(i) Has been employed continuously, by the agency in which the employee is serving, for at least the 31-day period ending on the date on which such agency requests the determination referred to in section 831.114(b);</P>
              <P>(ii) Is serving under an appointment that is not time limited;</P>
              <P>(iii) Has not been duly notified that such employee is to be involuntarily separated for misconduct or unacceptable performance;</P>
              <P>(iv) Is separated from the service voluntarily during a period in which, as determined by the Office of Personnel Management (upon request of the agency) under regulations prescribed by the Office:</P>
              <P>(A) Such agency (or, if applicable, the component in which the employee is serving) is undergoing substantial delayering, substantial reorganization, substantial reductions in force, substantial transfer of function, or other substantial workforce restructuring (or shaping);</P>
              <P>(B) A significant percentage of employees serving in such agency (or component) are likely to be separated or subject to an immediate reduction in the rate of basic pay (without regard to subchapter VI of chapter 53, or comparable provisions); or</P>

              <P>(C) Identified as being in positions which are becoming surplus or excess to the agency's future ability to carry out its mission effectively; and<PRTPAGE P="88"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) As determined by the agency under regulations prescribed by the Office, is within the scope of the offer of voluntary early retirement, which may be made based on the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(A) 1 or more organizational units;</P>
              <P>(B) 1 or more occupational series or levels;</P>
              <P>(C) 1 or more geographical locations;</P>
              <P>(D) Specific periods;</P>
              <P>(E) Skills, knowledge, or other factors related to a position; or</P>
              <P>(F) Any appropriate combination of such factors.</P>
              <P>(l) Agencies are responsible for ensuring that employees are not coerced into voluntary early retirement. If an agency finds any instances of coercion, it must take appropriate corrective action.</P>
              <P>(m) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, an agency may not offer or process voluntary early retirements beyond the stated expiration date of a voluntary early retirement authority or offer early retirements to employees who are not within the scope of the voluntary early retirement authority approved by OPM.</P>
              <P>(n) OPM may terminate a voluntary early retirement authority if it determines that the condition(s) that formed the basis for the approval of the authority no longer exist.</P>
              <P>(o) OPM may amend, limit, or terminate a voluntary early retirement authority to ensure that the requirements of this subpart are properly being followed.</P>

              <P>(a) For annuity computation purposes, the service of an employee who retires on immediate annuity or dies leaving a survivor entitled to annuity is increased by the days of unused sick leave to his credit under a formal leave system.</P>
              <P>(b) An immediate annuity is one which begins to accrue not later than 1 month after the employee is separated.</P>
              <P>(c) A formal leave system is one which is provided by law or regulation or operates under written rules specifying a group or class of employees to which it applies and the rate at which sick leave is earned.</P>
              <P>(d) In general, 8 hours of unused sick leave increases total services by 1 day. In cases where more or less than 8 hours of sick leave would be charged for a day's absence, total service is increased by the number of days in the period between the date of separation and the date that the unused sick leave would have expired had the employee used it (except that holidays falling within the period are treated as work days, and no additional leave credit is earned for that period).</P>
              <P>(e) If an employee's tour of duty changes from part time to full time or full time to part time within 180 days before retirement, the credit for unused sick leave is computed as though no change had occurred.</P>

              <P>(2) The employee, Member, or survivor makes a deposit (or redeposit) for the full period of service. If more than one distinct period of service is covered by a single refund, the periods of service covered by that refund are considered to be single full periods of service. However, in all other instances, a distinct period of nondeduction civilian service (i.e., a period of nondeduction service that is not interrupted by a break in service of more than three days) and a distinct period of redeposit civilian service (i.e., a period of redeposit service that is not interrupted by a break in service of more than three days) are considered as separate full periods of service, even when they are immediately consecutive. A period of nondeduction service which begins before October 1, 1982, and ends on or after that date is also considered two full periods of service: one ending on September 30, 1982, and the other beginning on October 1, 1982.</P>
              <P>(c)(1)(i) An employee or Member whose retirement is based on a separation before October 28, 2009, and who has not completed payment of a redeposit for refunded deductions based on a period of service that ended before October 1, 1990, will receive credit for that service in computing the nondisability annuity for which the individual is eligible under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, provided the nondisability annuity commences after December 1, 1990; and</P>
              <P>(ii) An employee or Member whose retirement is based on a separation on or after October 28, 2009, and who has not completed payment of a redeposit for refunded deductions based on a period of service that ended before March 1, 1991, will receive credit for that service in computing the nondisability annuity for which the individual is eligible under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code.</P>

              <P>(2) When the employee retires or withdraws the voluntary contributions, OPM will check to determine whether the 10 percent limit has been exceeded.</P>
              <P>(3) If the total of voluntary contributions received from the employee exceeds the 10 percent limit, OPM will refund without interest any amount that exceeds the 10 percent limit.</P>

              <P>(a) When an employee meets the requirements for age retirement on any day within a month, he is subject to automatic separation at the end of that month. The department or agency shall notify the employee of the automatic separation at least 60 days in advance of the separation.

              <P>(1) The recommendation shall contain:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement that the employee is willing to remain in service;</P>
              <P>(ii) A statement of facts tending to establish that his/her retention would be in the public interest;</P>

              <P>(2) The recommendation shall be accompanied by a medical certificate showing the physical fitness of the employee to perform his or her work.</P>
              <P>(e) OPM may approve an exemption only before the automatic separation date applicable to the employee. For this reason, the department or agency shall forward the recommendation to OPM at least 30 days before this separation date.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Election of insurable interest annuity.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) At the time of retirement, an employee or Member in good health, who is applying for a non-disability annuity, may elect an insurable interest annuity. Spousal consent is not required, but an election under this section does not exempt a married employee or Member from the provisions of § 831.611(a).</P>
                <P>(b) An insurable interest annuity may be elected by an employee or Member electing a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity or a former spouse annuity or annuities.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) In the case of a married employee or Member, an election under this section may not be made on behalf of a current spouse unless that current spouse has consented to an election not to provide a current spouse annuity in accordance with § 831.611(a)(1).</P>
                <P>(2) A consent (to an election not to provide a current spouse annuity in accordance with § 831.611(a)(1)) required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section to be eligible to be the beneficiary of an insurable interest annuity is cancelled if—</P>
                <P>(i) The retiree fails to qualify to receive the insurable interest annuity; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The retiree changes his or her election to receive an insurable interest annuity under § 831.621; or</P>
                <P>(iii) The retiree elects a fully or partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity under § 831.685.</P>
                <P>(3) An election of a partially reduced annuity under § 831.622(b) or § 831.685 to provide a current spouse annuity for a current spouse who is the beneficiary of an insurable interest annuity is void unless the spouse consents to the election.</P>
                <P>(4) If a retiree who had elected an insurable interest annuity to benefit a current spouse elects a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity (or, with the consent of the current spouse, a partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity) under § 831.622(b) or § 831.685, the election of the insurable interest annuity is cancelled.</P>
                <P>(5)(i) A retiring employee or Member may not elect a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity and an insurable interest annuity to benefit the same former spouse.</P>
                <P>(ii) If a retiring employee or Member who is required by court order to provide a former spouse annuity elects an insurable interest annuity to benefit the former spouse with the court-ordered entitlement—</P>
                <P>(A) If the benefit based on the election is greater than or equal to the benefit based on the court order, the election of the insurable interest annuity will satisfy the requirements of the court order as long as the insurable interest annuity continues.</P>
                <P>(B) If the benefit based on the election is less than the benefit based on the court order, the election of the insurable interest annuity is void.</P>
                <P>(iii) An election under § 831.632 of a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to benefit a former spouse by a retiree who elected and continues to receive an insurable interest annuity to benefit that former spouse is void.</P>
                <P>(d) To elect an insurable interest annuity, an employee or Member must indicate the intention to make the election on the application for retirement; submit evidence to demonstrate that he or she is in good health; and arrange and pay for the medical examination that shows that he or she is in good health. A report of the medical examination, signed and dated by a licensed physician, must be furnished to OPM on such forms and at such time and place as OPM may prescribe.</P>
                <P>(e) An insurable interest annuity may be elected to provide a survivor benefit only for a person who has an insurable interest in the retiring employee or Member.</P>
                <P>(1) An insurable interest is presumed to exist with—</P>
                <P>(i) The current spouse;</P>
                <P>(ii) The current same-sex domestic partner;</P>
                <P>(iii) A blood or adopted relative closer than first cousins;</P>
                <P>(iv) A former spouse;</P>
                <P>(v) A former same-sex domestic partner;</P>

                <P>(vi) A person to whom the employee or Member is engaged to be married, or a person with whom the employee or <PRTPAGE P="109"/>Member has agreed to enter into a same-sex domestic partnership;</P>
                <P>(vii) A person with whom the employee or Member is living in a relationship that would constitute a common-law marriage in jurisdictions recognizing common-law marriages;</P>
                <P>(2) For purposes of this section, the term “same-sex domestic partner” means a person in a domestic partnership with an employee or annuitant of the same sex and the term “domestic partnership” is defined as a committed relationship between two adults, of the same sex, in which the partners—</P>
                <P>(i) Are each other's sole domestic partner and intend to remain so indefinitely;</P>
                <P>(ii) Maintain a common residence, and intend to continue to do so (or would maintain a common residence but for an assignment abroad or other employment-related, financial, or similar obstacle);</P>
                <P>(iii) Are at least 18 years of age and mentally competent to consent to contract;</P>
                <P>(iv) Share responsibility for a significant measure of each other's financial obligations;</P>
                <P>(v) Are not married or joined in a civil union to anyone else;</P>
                <P>(vi) Are not the domestic partner of anyone else;</P>
                <P>(vii) Are not related in a way that, if they were of opposite sex, would prohibit legal marriage in the U.S. jurisdiction in which the domestic partnership was formed; and</P>
                <P>(viii) Are willing to certify, if required by OPM, that they understand that willful falsification of any documentation required to establish that an individual is in a domestic partnership may lead to disciplinary action and the recovery of the cost of benefits received related to such falsification, as well as constitute a criminal violation under 18 U.S.C. 1001.</P>
                <P>(3) When an insurable interest is not presumed, the employee or Member must submit affidavits from one or more persons with personal knowledge of the named beneficiary's insurable interest in the employee or Member. The affidavits must set forth the relationship, if any, between the named beneficiary and the employee or Member, the extent to which the named beneficiary is dependent on the employee or Member, and the reasons why the named beneficiary might reasonably expect to derive financial benefit from the continued life of the employee or Member.</P>
                <P>(4) The employee or Member may be required to submit documentary evidence to establish the named beneficiary's date of birth.</P>
                <P>(f) After receipt of all required evidence to support an election of an insurable interest annuity, OPM will notify the employee or Member of initial monthly annuity rates with and without the election of an insurable interest annuity and the initial rate payable to the named beneficiary. No election of an insurable interest annuity is effective unless the employee or Member confirms the election in writing, dies, or becomes incompetent no later than 60 days after the date of the notice described in this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(g) (1) When an employee or Member elects both an insurable interest annuity and a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity and/or a former spouse annuity or annuities, each reduction is computed based on the self-only annuity computation. The combined reduction may exceed the maximum 40 percent reduction in the retired employee's or Member's annuity permitted under section 8339(k)(1) of title 5, United States Code, applicable to insurable interest annuities.</P>
                <P>(2) The rate of annuity paid to the beneficiary of an insurable interest election, when the employee or Member also elected a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity, equals 55 (or 50 percent if based on a separation before October 11, 1962) percent of the rate of annuity after the insurable interest reduction. The additional reduction to provide a current spouse annuity or a former spouse annuity is not considered in determining the rate of annuity paid to the beneficiary of the insurable interest election.</P>

                <P>(h)(1) Except as provided in § 831.612(d), if a retiree who is receiving a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity has also elected an insurable interest annuity to benefit a current spouse and if the eligible <PRTPAGE P="110"/>former spouse remarries before age 55, dies, or loses eligibility under the terms of the court order, and no other former spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity based on an election made in accordance with § 831.632 or a qualifying court order, the retiree may elect, within 2 years after the former spouse's remarriage, death, or loss of eligibility under the terms of the court order, to convert the insurable interest annuity to a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, effective on the first day of the month following the event causing the former spouse to lose eligibility.</P>
                <P>(2) An election under paragraph (h)(1) of this section cancels any consent not to receive a current spouse annuity required by paragraph (c) of this section for the current spouse to be eligible for an annuity under this section.</P>
                <P>(3) When a former spouse receiving an annuity under section 8341(h) of title 5, United States Code, loses eligibility to that annuity, a beneficiary of an insurable interest annuity who was the current spouse at both the time of the retiree's retirement and death may, within 2 years after the former spouse's death, remarriage, or loss of eligibility under the terms of the court order, elect to receive a current spouse annuity instead of the annuity he or she had been receiving. The election is effective on the first day of the month following the event causing the former spouse to lose eligibility.</P>
                <P>(i) Upon the death of the current spouse, a retiree whose annuity is reduced to provide both a current spouse annuity and an insurable interest benefit for a former spouse is not permitted to convert the insurable interest annuity to a reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity.</P>
                <P>(j) An employee or Member may name only one natural person as the named beneficiary of an insurable interest annuity. OPM will not accept the designation of contingent beneficiaries and such a designation is void.</P>
                <P>(k)(1) An election under this section is prospectively voided by an election of a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity under § 831.631 that would benefit the same person.</P>
                <P>(2)(i) If the spouse is not the beneficiary of the election under this section, a retiree may prospectively void an election under this section at the time the retiree elects a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity under § 831.631.</P>
                <P>(ii) A retiree's election to void an election under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section must be filed at the same time as the election under § 831.631.</P>
                <P>(3) An annuity reduction under this section terminates on the first day of the month after the beneficiary of the insurable interest annuity dies.</P>

                <P>(b)(1) Except as provided in § 831.613 and paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, a retiree who was married at the time of retirement and has elected a self-only annuity, or a partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, or a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity, or an insurable interest annuity may elect, no later than 18 months after the time of retirement, an annuity reduction or an increased annuity reduction to provide a current spouse annuity.</P>
                <P>(2) A current spouse annuity based on an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section cannot be paid if it will, when combined with any former spouse annuity or annuities that are required by court order, exceed the maximum survivor annuity permitted under § 831.641.</P>
                <P>(3) To make an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the retiree must pay, in full, a deposit determined under § 831.662, plus interest, at the rate provided under § 831.105(g), no later than 18 months after the time of retirement.</P>

                <P>(iii) In the case of an election under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to the extent that it provides a former spouse annuity that exceeds the proportion of the retiree's annuity to which the former spouse would have been entitled as a current spouse annuity as of May 7, 1985.</P>
                <P>(c) An election under this section is not permitted unless the retiree agrees to deposit the amount equal to the difference between the amount of annuity actually paid to the retiree and the amount of annuity that would have been paid if the reduction elected under paragraph (a) of this section had been in effect continuously since the time of retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under § 831.105, from the date when each difference occurred.</P>
                <P>(d) Any reduction in an annuity to provide a former spouse annuity will terminate on the first day of the month after the former spouse remarries before age 55 or dies, or the former spouse's eligibility for a former spouse annuity terminates under the terms of a qualifying court order, unless—</P>

                <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, current spouse annuities, former spouse annuities, children's survivor annuities, and survivor annuities for beneficiaries of insurable interest annuities under CSRS begin to accrue on the day after death of the employee, Member, or retiree.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) A current spouse annuity begins to accrue—</P>
                <P>(i) Upon attainment of age 50 when, under section 12 of the Civil Service Retirement Act Amendments of February 29, 1948, the annuity is deferred until age 50; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Upon OPM's receipt of a claim for an annuity authorized for unremarried widows and widowers by section 2 of the Civil Service Retirement Act Amendments of June 25, 1958, 72 Stat. 218.</P>
                <P>(2) A former spouse annuity begins to accrue—</P>
                <P>(i) For annuities under § 831.683, on the later of the day after date of death of the retiree or the first day of the second month after the date the application for annuity is received in OPM; or</P>

                <P>(ii) For annuities when a former spouse annuity is authorized by court order under section 8341(h) of title 5, United States Code, on the later of the day after the date of death of the employee, Member, or retiree or the first day of the second month after the court order awarding the former spouse annuity and the supporting documentation required by § 838.721 or § 838.1005 of this chapter are received in OPM.<PRTPAGE P="118"/>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements for an annuity.</E> (1) For a child age 18 to 22 to be eligible to receive an annuity as a full-time student, the child must also meet all other requirements applicable to qualify for an annuity by a child who has not attained age 18.</P>
                <P>(2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, OPM must receive certification, in a form prescribed by OPM, that the child is regularly pursuing a full-time course of study in an accredited institution.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Full-time course of study.</E> (1) Generally, a full-time course of study is a noncorrespondence course which, if successfully completed, will lead to completion of the education within the period generally accepted as minimum for completion, by a full-time day student, of the academic or training program concerned.</P>

                <P>(2) A certification by an accredited institution that the student's workload is sufficient to constitute a full-time <PRTPAGE P="121"/>course of study for the program in which the student is enrolled is prima facie evidence that the student is pursuing a full-time course of study.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Certification of school attendance.</E> (1) OPM may periodically request the recipient of a child's annuity payments to furnish certification of school attendance. The certification must be completed in the form prescribed by OPM.</P>
                <P>(2) If OPM requests the recipient of a child's annuity payments to provide a self-certification of school attendance, the recipient must complete and sign the certification form.</P>
                <P>(3) If OPM requests the recipient of a child's annuity payments to provide a certification by the school, the certification must be signed by an official who is either in charge of the school or in charge of the school's records. OPM will not accept certification forms signed by instructors, counselors, aides, roommates, or others not in charge of the school or the records.</P>
                <P>(i) If the educational institution is above the high school level, the certification must be signed by the president or chancellor, vice president or vice chancellor, dean or assistant dean, registrar or administrator, assistant registrar or assistant administrator, or the equivalent.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the educational institution is at the high school level, the certification must be signed by the superintendent of schools, assistant superintendent of schools, principal, vice principal, assistant principal, or the equivalent.</P>
                <P>(iii) If the educational institution is a technical or trade school, the certification must be signed by the president, vice president, director, assistant director, or the equivalent.</P>
                <P>(4) OPM will accept a facsimile signature of a school official only if it is accompanied by a raised seal of the institution or other evidence clearly demonstrating the authenticity of the certification and making unauthorized use of the signature stamp unlikely.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Continuation of annuity during interim breaks.</E> A child's annuity continues during interim breaks between school years if the following conditions are satisfied:</P>
                <P>(1) The student must have been a full-time student at the end of the school term immediately before the break.</P>
                <P>(2) The break between the end of the last term of full-time attendance and the return to full-time attendance must not exceed 5 months. (See § 831.107, concerning calculation of this time period.)</P>
                <P>(3) The recipient of a child's annuity payments must show that the student has a bona fide intent to return to school as a full-time student immediately after the break. The full-time certification for the prior term and the certification (in a form prescribed by OPM) by the recipient of a child's annuity payments that the student intends to return to school (immediately after the break) as a full-time student constitute prima facie evidence of a bona fide intent to return to school.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Benefits after age 22.</E> (1) A student's eligibility for a child's annuity terminates based on reaching age 22 on—</P>
                <P>(i) June 30 of the calendar year of the child's 22nd birthday if the child's birthday is before July 1; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The last day of the month before the child's 22nd birthday if the child's birthday occurs after June 30 but before September 1 of the calendar year; or</P>

                <P>(ii) An otherwise eligible child who is a full-time student, and whose parent dies after the child's 22nd birthday but before the date the annuity terminates under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is eligible for annuity while he or she is a full-time student after the death of the parent until the termination date under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Election by a retiree who retired before May 7, 1985, to provide a former spouse annuity.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A retiree who retired before May 7, 1985, including a retiree receiving a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, may elect a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity.</P>
                <P>(b) The election should be made by letter addressed to OPM. The election must—</P>
                <P>(1) Be in writing; and</P>
                <P>(2) Agree to pay any deposit due under paragraph (c) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(3) Be signed by the retiree; and</P>
                <P>(4) Be filed with OPM before September 8, 1987.</P>
                <P>(c)(1)(i) If a retiree who is receiving an insurable interest annuity elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section to benefit the same person, the insurable interest annuity terminates. A retiree who is receiving an insurable interest annuity at the time that an annuity is elected under this section does not owe any further deposit.</P>

                <P>(ii) If a retiree who had been receiving an insurable interest annuity, which was terminated to elect a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity for a spouse acquired after retirement, elects to provide a former spouse annuity for a former spouse who was the beneficiary of the insurable interest annuity, the retiree <PRTPAGE P="123"/>must deposit an amount equal to the sum of the monthly differences between the self-only annuity and a fully reduced annuity or partially reduced annuity (with the same base as elected to provide the former spouse annuity) from the date the insurable interest annuity terminated, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under § 831.105, from the date to which each monthly difference is attributable.</P>
                <P>(2) A retiree who elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section, to provide a former spouse annuity for a former spouse for whom the retiree had elected (during the marriage to that former spouse) a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, must deposit an amount equal to the sum of the monthly differences between the self-only annuity and the amount of annuity that would have been in effect had a fully reduced annuity or partially reduced annuity (with the same base as elected to provide the former spouse annuity) been in effect continuously since the time of retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under § 831.105, from the date to which each monthly difference is attributable, except that the retiree will not be charged for any period during which the survivor reduction was in effect for that former spouse.</P>
                <P>(3) A retiree who elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section, and is not covered under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, must deposit an amount equal to the sum of the monthly difference between the self-only annuity and a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity (with the same base as elected to provide the former spouse annuity) since the time of retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under § 831.105, from the date to which each monthly difference is attributable.</P>
                <P>(d) If a retiree who is receiving a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section to provide a former spouse annuity, the annuity will be reduced separately to provide for the current and former spouse annuities. Each separate reduction will be computed based on the self-only annuity, and the separate reductions are cumulative.</P>
                <P>(e)(1) In response to a retiree's inquiry about providing a former spouse annuity under this section, OPM will send an application form. The application form will include a notice to retirees that filing the application constitutes an official election which cannot be revoked after 30 days after the annuity check in which the annuity reduction first appears.</P>
                <P>(2) If the retiree returns the application electing a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section, OPM will notify the retiree of—</P>
                <P>(i) The rate of the fully reduced annuity or partially reduced annuity; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The rate of the potential former spouse annuity; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The amount of the deposit, including interest, that is due as of the date that the annuity reduction is scheduled to begin; and</P>
                <P>(iv) The amount and duration of installment payments if no deposit is made.</P>
                <P>(3) The notice under paragraph (e)(2) of this section will advise the retiree that the deposit will be collected in installments under § 831.665, unless lump-sum payment is made within 60 days from the date of the notice.</P>
                <P>(4) OPM will reduce the annuity and begin collection of the deposit in installments effective with the first check payable more than 60 days after the date on the notice required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f)(1) A retiree who made an election under this section prior to September 9, 1986 may modify that election by designating a lesser portion of the retiree's annuity be used as the base for the annuity reduction and the former spouse annuity.</P>
                <P>(2) Any modification under paragraph (f)(1) of this section must be in writing and received in OPM no later than the date provided for applications in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>

                <P>(g) The annuity reduction resulting in a fully reduced annuity or partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity under this section terminates on the first day of the month <PRTPAGE P="124"/>after the former spouse remarries before age 55 or dies.</P>
                <P>(h) A former spouse is eligible to receive only one survivor annuity based on the service of one employee or Member.</P>
                <P>(i) If a former spouse is entitled to a former spouse annuity based on an election under this section, but absent that election would have been entitled to a former spouse annuity under § 831.683 (i.e., filed a timely application as well as meeting all other requirements), the amount of the former spouse annuity payable will equal 55 percent of the annuity of the retiree on whose service the survivor annuity is based.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Annuities for former spouses of employees or Members retired before May 7, 1985.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a)(1) The former spouse of a retiree who retired before May 7, 1985 (or of an employee or Member who died before May 7, 1985, was employed in a position covered by CSRS at the time of death, and was eligible to retire at the time of death), is entitled, after the death of the retiree, employee, or Member, to a survivor annuity equal to 55 percent of the self-only annuity of the retiree on whose service the survivor annuity is based if the former spouse, at the time of application, meets all of the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(i) The former spouse's marriage to the retiree, employee, or Member was dissolved after September 14, 1978, and before May 8, 1987. The date of dissolution of a marriage is the date when the marriage between the former spouse and the retiree, employee, or Member ended under the law of the jurisdiction that terminated the marriage, rather than the date when restrictions on remarriage ended. The date of entry of the decree terminating the marriage will be rebuttably presumed to be the date when the marriage was dissolved.</P>
                <P>(ii) The former spouse was married to the retiree, employee, or Member for at least 10 years of the retiree's, employee's, or Member's creditable service. Creditability of service is determined in accordance with section 8332 of title 5, United States Code, and subpart C of this part.</P>
                <P>(iii) The former spouse has not remarried before reaching age 55.</P>
                <P>(iv) The former spouse applies to OPM for a survivor annuity, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and § 831.643(b), before May 8, 1989.</P>
                <P>(v) The former spouse is at least 50 years old on May 7, 1987, and when filing the application.</P>
                <P>(2) A former spouse who is not eligible for an annuity under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and who is the former spouse of a retiree who retired before May 7, 1985 (or of an employee or Member who died before May 7, 1985, was employed in a position covered by CSRS at the time of death, and was eligible to retire at the time of death), is entitled, after the death of the retiree, employee, or Member, to a survivor annuity equal to 55 percent of the self-only annuity of the retiree on whose service the survivor annuity is based if the former spouse, at the time of application, meets all of the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(i) The former spouse was married to the retiree, employee, or Member for at least 10 years of the retiree's, employee's, or Member's creditable service. Creditability of service is determined in accordance with section 8332 of title 5, United States Code, and subpart C of this part.</P>
                <P>(ii) The former spouse has not remarried after September 14, 1978, before reaching age 55.</P>
                <P>(iii) The former spouse applies to OPM for a survivor annuity, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and § 831.643(b), before May 8, 1989.</P>
                <P>(iv) The former spouse is at least 50 years old on May 7, 1987, and when filing the application.</P>
                <P>(v) No current spouse, other former spouse, or insurable interest designee is receiving or has been designated to receive a survivor annuity based on the service of the employee, Member, or retiree.</P>

                <P>(3) If two or more eligible former spouses of a retiree, employee, or Member apply for annuities under paragraph (a)(2) of this section based on the service of the same retiree, employee, <PRTPAGE P="125"/>or Member, and neither meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the former spouse whose application OPM receives first is entitled to the annuity.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) Application must be filed on the form prescribed for that purpose by OPM. The application form will require the former spouse to certify under the penalty provided by section 1001 of title 18, United States Code, that he or she meets the requirements listed in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) In addition to the application form required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the former spouse must submit proof of his or her age and the date when the marriage to the retiree commenced, and a certified copy of the divorce decree terminating the marriage to the retiree.</P>
                <P>(3)(i) Former spouses applying for benefits under this section must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at the time of application.</P>
                <P>(ii) An annuity under this section terminates on the last day of the month before the former spouse remarries before age 55 or dies, except that a remarriage before September 15, 1978, does not cause termination of a former spouse annuity under this section. A former spouse who is receiving a former spouse annuity under this section must notify OPM within 30 days after he or she remarries before age 55.</P>
                <P>(c) Survivor annuities payable under this section commence on the later of the day after the date of death of the retiree or the first day of the second month after the application is filed under § 831.643(b).</P>
                <P>(d) Cost-of-living adjustments under section 8340 of title 5, United States Code, are applicable to annuities payable under this section.</P>
                <P>(e) If a former spouse is eligible for a former spouse annuity under this section and another current spouse annuity or former spouse annuity (under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System) resulting from the death of the same retiree, the annuity under this section will be paid instead of the other current spouse annuity or former spouse annuity.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Second chance elections to provide survivor benefits.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A married retiree who retired before May 7, 1985, and is not currently receiving a fully or partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity may elect a fully or partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity for a spouse acquired after retirement if the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(1) (i) The retiree was married at the time of retirement and did not elect a survivor annuity at that time; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The retiree failed to elect a fully or partially reduced annuity within 1 year after a post-retirement marriage that occurred before November 8, 1984, and the retiree attempted to elect a fully or partially reduced annuity after the time limit expired and that request was disallowed as untimely.</P>
                <P>(2) The retiree applies for a fully or partially reduced annuity under this section before November 9, 1985.</P>
                <P>(3) The retiree agrees to pay the amount due under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) Applications must be filed on the form prescribed by OPM, except filing the form is excused when the retiree dies before filing the required form if:</P>
                <P>(1) The retiree made a written request, after November 8, 1984, to elect a fully or partially reduced annuity under this section, and</P>
                <P>(2) The retiree was denied the opportunity to file the required form because the retiree, without fault, did not receive the form in sufficient time for the retiree to be reasonably expected to complete the form before death.</P>

                <P>(c)(1) In response to a retiree's inquiry about providing a current spouse annuity under this section, OPM will send an application form. This application will include instructions to assist the retiree in estimating the amount of reduction in the annuity to provide the current spouse annuity and the amount of the required deposit. The application <PRTPAGE P="126"/>form will include a notice to retirees that filing the application constitutes an official election which cannot be revoked after 30 days after the annuity check in which the annuity reduction first appears.</P>
                <P>(2) If the retiree returns the application electing a fully or partially reduced annuity under this section, OPM will notify the retiree of—</P>
                <P>(i) The rate of the fully reduced annuity; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The rate of the potential current spouse annuity; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The amount of the deposit, including interest, that is due as of the date that the annuity reduction is scheduled to begin; and</P>
                <P>(iv) The amount and duration of installment payments if no deposit is made.</P>
                <P>(3) The notice under paragraph (c)(2) of this section will advise the retiree that the deposit will be collected in installments under § 831.665, unless lump-sum payment is made within 60 days from the date of this notice.</P>
                <P>(4) OPM will reduce the annuity and begin collection of the deposit in installments effective with the first check payable more than 60 days after the date on the notice required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) The retiree must state on the application form whether the application is made under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section or paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. If the application is made under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the retiree must prove that he or she had attempted to elect a fully reduced annuity and that OPM rejected that application because it was filed too late. The proof must consist of a copy of OPM's letter rejecting the previous election as untimely filed or an affidavit swearing or affirming that he or she made an untimely application which OPM rejected. The affidavit is sufficient documentation to provide proof of the retiree's attempt to elect a reduced annuity, unless the record contains convincing evidence to rebut the certification.</P>
                <P>(e) A retiree who elects to provide a current spouse annuity under this section must agree to pay a deposit equal to the difference between the amount of annuity actually paid to the retiree and the amount of annuity that would have been paid if a fully reduced annuity were being paid continuously since the time of retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under § 831.105, from the date when each difference occurred.</P>
                <P>(f) The rate of a survivor annuity under this section will be computed under the laws in effect at the time of the retiree's separation from the Federal service.</P>

                <P>(a) Except as provided in § 831.613 and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a retiree who retired before May 28, 1986, was married at the time of retirement, and at the time of retirement did not elect a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity may elect a fully reduced annuity or a greater partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) An election under paragraph (a) of this section may be made only by a retiree who is married to the same spouse to whom the retiree was married at the time of retirement.</P>
                <P>(2) A current spouse annuity based on an election under paragraph (a) of this section cannot be paid if it will, when combined with any former spouse annuity or annuities that are required by court order, exceed the maximum survivor annuity permitted under § 831.641.</P>
                <P>(3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, to make an election under paragraph (a) of this section, the retiree must pay the deposit computed under § 831.662, in full, no later than November 28, 1987.</P>
                <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, failure to pay the deposit, in full, before November 29, 1987, voids an election made under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

                <P>(4) If a retiree makes an election under paragraph (a) of this section and is prevented from paying the deposit within the 18-month time limit because OPM did not send him or her a notice <PRTPAGE P="127"/>of the amount of the deposit at least 30 days before the time limit expires, the time limit for making the deposit will be extended to 30 days after OPM sends the notice of the amount of the deposit.</P>
                <P>(5) For a retiree whose annuity commenced on or after May 7, 1985, an election under paragraph (a) of this section cancels any spouse consent under § 831.611 to the extent of the election.</P>
                <P>(c) If a retiree who had elected a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity makes an election under paragraph (a) of this section that would cause the combined current spouse annuity and former spouse annuity (or annuities) to exceed the maximum allowed under § 831.641, the former spouse annuity (or annuities) must be reduced to conform with that allowed under § 831.641.</P>
                <P>(d) An election under paragraph (a) of this section is void unless it is filed with OPM before the retiree dies.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Computation of annuities for part-time service.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The computational method in this section shall be used to determine the annuity for an employee who has part-time service on or after April 7, 1986.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> In this section—</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Full-time service</E> means service performed by an employee who has—</P>
              <P>(1) An officially established recurring basic workweek consisting of 40 hours within the employee's administrative workweek (as established under § 610.111 of this chapter or similar authority);</P>
              <P>(2) An officially established recurring basic work requirement of 80 hours per biweekly pay period (as established for employees with a flexible or compressed work schedule under 5 U.S.C. chapter 61, subchapter II, or similar authority);</P>
              <P>(3) For a firefighter covered by 5 U.S.C. 5545b(b) who does not have a 40-hour basic workweek, a regular tour of duty averaging at least 106 hours per biweekly pay period; or</P>
              <P>(4) A work schedule that is considered to be full-time by express provision of law, including a work schedule established for certain nurses under 38 U.S.C. 7456 or 7456A that is considered by law to be a full-time schedule for all purposes.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Intermittent service</E> means any actual service performed with no prescheduled regular tour of duty.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Part-time service</E> means any actual service performed on a less than full-time basis, by an individual whose appointment describes a regularly scheduled tour of duty, and any period of time credited as non pay status time under 5 U.S.C. 8332(f), which follows a period of part-time service without any intervening period of actual service other than part-time service. This definition is not limited to part-time career employment because it includes part-time temporary employment as well.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Post-April 6, 1986 average pay</E> means the largest annual rate resulting from averaging, over any period of 3 consecutive years of creditable service, the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service by an employee during that period, with each rate weighted by the time it was in effect, except that for periods of service before April 7, 1986, the actual rate of basic pay based on the employee's established tour of duty, if different, is used in the computation. The rates of pay included in the computation for intermittent service or temporary service performed on a full-time basis are the actual rates of basic pay during those periods of creditable service.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Pre-April 7, 1986, average pay</E> means the largest annual rate resulting from averaging, over any period of 3 consecutive years of creditable service, an employee's actual rates of basic pay during that period, with each rate weighted by the time it was in effect.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Proration factor</E> means a fraction expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest percent. The numerator is the sum of the number of hours the employee actually worked during part-time service, and the denominator is the sum of the number of hours that a full-time employee would be schedule to work during the same period of service included in the numerator. If an employee has creditable service in addition to part-time service (full-time service, intermittent service, or temporary service performed on a full-time basis), such service must be included in the numerator and denominator of the fraction. In general, this is done by including the number of days of such intermittent service, multiplied by 8, and the number of weeks of such temporary service or full-time service, multiplied by 40 in both the numerator and the denominator. The additional credit for unused sick leave under 5 U.S.C. 8339(m) is not included in the fraction.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Temporary service</E> means service under an appointment limited to one year or less, exclusive of intermittent service.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Pre-April 7, 1986, basic annuity.</E> The partial annuity for pre-April 7, 1986, service is computed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8339 using the pre-April 7, 1986, <PRTPAGE P="129"/>average pay and length of service (increased by the unused sick leave credit at time of retirement) prior to April 7, 1986.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Post-April 6, 1986, basic annuity.</E> The partial annuity for post-April 6, 1986, service is computed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8339 using the post-April 6, 1986, average pay and length of service after April 6, 1986. This amount is then multiplied by the proration factor.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Combined basic annuity.</E> The combined basic annuity is equal to the sum of the partial annuity amounts computed under paragraphs (c) and (d). This amount is the yearly rate of annuity (on which the monthly rate is based) before reductions for retirement before age 55; pre-October 1, 1982, nondeduction service and survivor benefits; or the reduction for an alternative annuity under section 204 of Pub. L 99-335.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> The use of the post-April 6, 1986, average pay is limited to the purposes stated in this section. It may not be used as the basis for computing:</P>
              <P>(1) The 80-percent limit on annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8339(f);</P>
              <P>(2) The minimum annuity amount under 5 U.S.C. 8339(e) (concerning air traffic controller annuity) or 5 U.S.C. 8339(g) (concerning disability annuity); or</P>
              <P>(3) A supplemental annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8344(a).</P>

This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withholdings and contributions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) During the service covered under the conditions established by § 831.803 and § 831.804, the Department of Energy will deduct and withhold from the employee's base pay the amount required under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a) for such positions and submit that amount, together with agency contributions required by 5 U.S.C. 8334(a), to OPM in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.</P>
              <P>(b) If the correct withholdings and/or Government contributions are not submitted to OPM for any reason whatsoever, including cases in which it is finally determined that past service of a current or former employee was subject to the higher deduction and Government contribution rates, the Department of Energy must correct the error by submitting the correct amounts (including both employee and agency shares) to OPM as soon as possible. Even if the Department of Energy waives collection of the overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be available for this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to collect the debt, the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM without delay as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or eligible survivor of a former employee, the Department of Energy will pay a refund of erroneous additional withholdings for service that is found not to have been covered service. If an individual has paid to OPM a deposit or redeposit, including the additional amount required for covered service, and the deposit or redeposit is later determined to be erroneous because the service was not covered service, OPM will pay the refund, upon proper application, to the individual, without interest.</P>

              <P>(d) The additional employee withholding and agency contribution for covered or creditable service properly made as required under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a)(1) or deposited under 5 U.S.C. 8334(c) are not separately refundable, even in the event that the employee or his or her survivor does not qualify for <PRTPAGE P="132"/>a special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 8339(d).</P>
              <P>(e) While an employee who does not hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will not be made. While an employee who does hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a position which is not a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will continue to be made.</P>

              <P>(a) Effective on and after October 17, 1999, the mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) apply to all nuclear materials couriers in primary and secondary positions. A mandatory separation under 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) is not an adverse action under part 752 of this chapter or a removal action under part 359 of this chapter. Section 831.502 provides the procedures for requesting an exemption from mandatory separation.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 U.S.C. 8335(b), or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c), and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service required for entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position which did not meet the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the conditions set forth in this subpart, such separation will be considered erroneous.</P>

For the purpose of an approval of coverage under this subpart, <E T="03">agency head</E> is also deemed to include the designated representative of the head of an executive department as defined in 5 U.S.C. 101, except that the designated representative must be a department headquarters-level official who reports directly to the executive department head, or to the deputy department head, and who is the sole such representative for the entire department. For the purpose of a denial of coverage under this subpart, <E T="03">agency head</E> is also deemed to include the designated representative of the <E T="03">agency head</E>, as defined in the first sentence of this definition, at any level within the agency.</P>

              <P>(a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by the employing agency head to be a secondary law enforcement officer or firefighter position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) if all of the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The employee is transferred directly (i.e., without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary position; and</P>
              <P>(2) If applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in secondary positions since transferring from a primary position without a break in service exceeding 3 days, except that a break in employment in secondary positions which begins with an involuntary separation (not for cause), within the meaning of 8336(d)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is not considered in determining whether the service in secondary positions is continuous for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(b) This requirement for continuous employment in a secondary position applies only to voluntary breaks in service beginning after January 19, 1988.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requests from individuals.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) An employee who requests credit for service under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) bears the burden of proof with respect to <PRTPAGE P="135"/>that service, and must provide the employing agency with all pertinent information regarding duties performed, including—</P>
              <P>(1) For law enforcement officers, a list of the provisions of Federal criminal law the incumbent is responsible for enforcing and arrests made; and</P>
              <P>(2) For firefighters, number of fires fought, names of fires fought, dates of fires, and position occupied while on firefighting duty.</P>
              <P>(b) An employee who is currently serving in a position that has not been approved as a primary or secondary position, but who believes that his or her service is creditable as service in a primary or secondary position may request the agency head to determine whether or not the employee's service should be credited and, if it qualifies, whether it should be a primary or secondary position.</P>
              <P>(c) A current or former employee (or the survivor of a former employee) who believes that a period of past service in an unapproved position qualifies as service in a primary or secondary position and meets the conditions for credit must follow the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the request must be made to the agency where the claimed service was performed.</P>
              <P>(d) For a current or former employee seeking credit under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) for service performed at an agency that is no longer in existence, and for which there is no successor agency, OPM will accept, directly from the current or former employee (or the survivor of a former employee), a request for a determination as to whether a period of past service qualifies as service in a primary or secondary position and meets the conditions for credit.</P>
              <P>(e) Coverage in a position or credit for past service will not be granted for a period greater than 1 year prior to the date that the request from an individual is received under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section by the employing agency, the agency where past service was performed, or OPM.</P>
              <P>(f) An agency head, in the case of a request filed under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, or OPM, in the case of request filed under paragraph (d) of this section, may extend the time limit for filing when, in the judgment of such agency head or OPM, the individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withholdings and contributions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) During the service covered under the conditions established by § 831.903 and § 831.904, the employing agency will deduct and withhold from the employee's base pay the amount required under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a) for such positions and submit that amount, together with agency contributions required by 5 U.S.C. 8334(a), to OPM in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.</P>
              <P>(b) If the correct withholdings and/or Government contributions are not submitted to OPM for any reason whatsoever, including cases in which it is finally determined that past service of a current or former employee was subject to the higher deduction and Government contribution rates, the employing agency must correct the error by submitting the correct amounts (including both employee and agency shares) to OPM as soon as possible. Even if the agency waives collection of the overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be available for this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to collect the debt, the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM without delay as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or eligible survivor of a former employee, an employing agency or former employing agency will pay a refund of erroneous additional withholdings for service that is found not to have been covered service. If an individual has paid to OPM a deposit or redeposit, including the additional amount required for covered service, and the deposit or redeposit is later determined to be erroneous because the service was not covered service, OPM will pay the refund, upon proper application, to the individual, without interest.</P>

              <P>(d) The additional employee withholding and agency contribution for <PRTPAGE P="136"/>covered or creditable service properly made as required under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a)(1) or deposited under 5 U.S.C. 8334(c) are not separately refundable, even in the event that the employee or his or her survivor does not qualify for a special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 8339(d).</P>
              <P>(e) While an employee who does not hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will not be made. While an employee who does hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a position which is not a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will continue to be made.</P>

              <P>(a) The mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) apply to all law enforcement officers and firefighters in primary and secondary positions. A mandatory separation under section 8335(b) is not an adverse action under part 752 of this chapter or a removal action under part 359 of this chapter. Section 831.502 provides the procedures for requesting an exemption from mandatory separation.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 U.S.C. 8335(b), or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c), and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service required for entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position which did not meet the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the conditions set forth in this subpart, such separation will be considered erroneous.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Offset from disability or survivor annuity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) OPM will reduce the disability annuity (an annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8337) of an individual who performed Federal service, if the individual is (or would on proper application be) entitled to disability payments under section 223 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 423).</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Before an application for disability retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8337 can be finally approved in the case of an employee who has Federal service, the applicant must provide OPM with—</P>
              <P>(i) Satisfactory evidence that the applicant has filed an application for disability insurance benefits under section 223 of the Social Security Act; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An official statement from the Social Security Administration that the individual is not insured for disability insurance benefits as defined in section 223(c)(1) of the Social Security Act.</P>
              <P>(2) A disability retirement application under 5 U.S.C. 8337 will be dismissed when OPM is notified by the Social Security Administration that the application referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section has been withdrawn unless the evidence described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section has been provided.</P>
              <P>(c) OPM will reduce a survivor annuity (an annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8341) based on the service of an individual who performed Federal service, if the survivor annuitant is entitled, or on proper application would be entitled, to survivor benefits under section 202 (d), (e), or (f) (relating to children's, widow's, and widowers' benefits, respectively) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 202 (d), (e), or (f)).</P>

              <P>(d) The reduction required under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section begins (or is reinstated) on the 1st day <PRTPAGE P="140"/>of the month during which the disability or survivor annuitant—</P>
              <P>(1) Is entitled to disability or survivor annuity under CSRS; and</P>
              <P>(2) Is entitled, or on proper application would be entitled, to disability or survivor benefits under the Social Security Act provisions mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, respectively.</P>
              <P>(e) The reduction under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section will be computed and adjusted in a manner consistent with the provisions of § 831.1005(c) through (e).</P>
              <P>(f) A reduction under paragraph (a) or (c) of this section stops on the date entitlement to the disability or survivor benefits under title II of the Social Security Act terminates. In the case of a disability or survivor annuitant who has not made proper application for the Social Security benefit, the reduction under paragraph (a) or (c) of this section stops on the date entitlement to such disability or survivor benefits would otherwise terminate. If a Social Security benefit is reduced under any provision of the Social Security Act, even if reduced to zero, entitlement to that benefit is not considered to have terminated.</P>
              <P>(g) OPM will accept the determination or certification of the Social Security Administration, submitted in a form prescribed by OPM, concerning entitlement to Social Security disability or survivor benefits and the beginning and ending dates thereof.</P>
              <P>(h) If a disability annuitant who is not entitled to disability benefits under title II of the Social Security Act subsequently becomes entitled to old-age benefits under the Social Security Act, a reduction under § 831.1005 will begin on the 1st day of the month during which the annuitant becomes entitled, or on proper application would be entitled, to Social Security old-age insurance benefits.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Medical condition</E> means a health impairment resulting from a disease or injury, including a psychiatric disease. This is the same definition of “medical condition” as in § 339.104 of this chapter.</P>

The vacant position must be full time, unless the employee's current position is less than full time, in which case the vacant position must have a work schedule of no less time than that of the current position. In the case of an employee of the United States Postal Service, a vacant position does not include a position in a different craft or a position to which reassignment would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement covering the employee.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, an application for disability retirement is timely only if it is filed with the employing agency before the employee or Member separates from service, or with the former employing agency or OPM within 1 year thereafter.</P>
              <P>(b) An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM, an employing agency or former employing agency by personal delivery is considered filed on the date on which OPM, the employing agency or former employing agency receives it. The date of filing by facsimile is the date of the facsimile. The date of filing by mail is determined by the postmark date; if no legible postmark date appears on the mailing, the application is presumed to have been mailed 5 days before its receipt, excluding days on which OPM, the employing agency or former employing agency, as appropriate, is closed for business. The date of filing by commercial overnight delivery is the date the application is given to the overnight delivery service.</P>

              <P>(c) An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM or the applicant's former employing agency <PRTPAGE P="144"/>within 1 year after the employee's separation, and that is incompletely executed or submitted in a letter or other form not prescribed by OPM, is deemed timely filed. OPM will not adjudicate the application or make payment until the application is filed on a form prescribed by OPM.</P>
              <P>(d) OPM may waive the 1-year time limit if the employee or Member is mentally incompetent on the date of separation or within 1 year thereafter, in which case the individual or his or her representative must file the application with the former employing agency or OPM within 1 year after the date the individual regains competency or a court appoints a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</P>
              <P>(e) An agency may consider the existence of a pending disability retirement application when deciding whether and when to take other personnel actions. An employee's filing for disability retirement does not require the agency to delay any appropriate personnel action.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for filing an application for an employee.</E> An agency must file an application for disability retirement of an employee who has 5 years of civilian Federal service when all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The agency has issued a decision to remove the employee;</P>
              <P>(2) The agency concludes, after its review of medical documentation, that the cause for unacceptable performance, attendance, or conduct is disease or injury;</P>
              <P>(3) The employee is institutionalized, or the agency concludes, based on a review of medical and other information, that the employee is incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability retirement;</P>
              <P>(4) The employee has no personal representative or guardian; and</P>
              <P>(5) The employee has no immediate family member who is willing to file an application on his or her behalf.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency procedures.</E> (1) When an agency issues a decision to remove an employee and not all of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section have been satisfied, but the removal is based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the agency must advise the employee in writing of his or her possible eligibility for disability retirement.</P>
              <P>(2) If the agency is filing a disability retirement application on the employee's behalf, the agency must inform the employee in writing at the same time it informs the employee of its removal decision, or at any time before the separation is effected, that—</P>
              <P>(i) The agency is submitting a disability retirement application on the employee's behalf to OPM;</P>
              <P>(ii) The employee may review any medical information in accordance with the criteria in § 294.106(d) of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The action does not affect the employee's right to submit a voluntary application for retirement under this part.</P>
              <P>(3) When an agency submits an application for disability retirement to OPM on behalf of an employee, it must provide OPM with copies of the decision to remove, the medical documentation, and any other documents needed to show that the cause for removal is due to a medical condition. Following separation, the agency must provide OPM with a copy of the documentation of the separation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">OPM procedures.</E> (1) OPM will not act on any application for disability retirement filed by an agency on behalf on an employee until it receives the appropriate documentation of the separation. When OPM receives a complete application for disability retirement under this section, it will notify the former employee that it has received the application, and that he or she may submit medical documentation. OPM will determine entitlement to disability benefits under § 831.1206.</P>
              <P>(2) OPM will cancel any disability retirement when a final decision of an administrative authority or court reverses the removal action and orders the reinstatement of an employee to the agency rolls.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Evidence to support disability retirement application.</E> (1) Before OPM determines whether an individual meets the basic requirements for disability retirement under § 831.1203, an applicant for disability retirement or the employing agency must submit to OPM the following forms included in Standard Form 2824, “Documentation in Support of Disability Retirement Application:”</P>
              <P>(i) Standard Form 2824A—“Applicant's Statement;”</P>
              <P>(ii) Standard Form 2824B—“Supervisor's Statement;”</P>

              <P>(iv) Standard Form 2824E—“Disability Retirement Application Checklist.”</P>
              <P>(2) Standard Form 2824C—“Physician's Statement” and the supporting medical documentation may be submitted directly to OPM.</P>
              <P>(3) The applicant, or the employing agency, must also obtain and submit additional documentation as may be required by OPM to determine entitlement to the disability retirement benefit.</P>
              <P>(4) Refusal by the applicant, physician, or employing agency to submit the documentation OPM has determined is necessary to decide eligibility for disability retirement is grounds for disallowance of the application.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">OPM procedures for processing a disability retirement application.</E> (1) OPM will review the documentation submitted under paragraph (a) of this section in support of an application for disability retirement to determine whether the applicant has met the conditions stated in § 831.1203 of this part. OPM will issue its decision in writing to the applicant and to the employing agency. The decision will include a statement of the findings and conclusions, and an explanation of the right to request consideration under § 831.109 of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) OPM may rescind a decision to allow an application for disability retirement at any time if there is an indication of error in the original decision, such as fraud or misstatement of fact, or if additional medical documentation is needed. The written notification will include a statement of the findings and conclusions, and an explanation of the right to request reconsideration under § 831.109 of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Medical examination.</E> OPM may offer the applicant a medical examination when it determines that additional medical evidence is necessary to make a decision on an application. The medical evaluation will be conducted by a medical officer of the United States or a qualified physician or board of physicians designated by OPM. The applicant's refusal to submit to an examination is grounds for disallowance of the application.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Responsibility for providing evidence.</E> It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain and submit documentation that is sufficient for OPM to determine whether there is a service deficiency, caused by disease or injury, of sufficient degree to preclude useful and efficient service, or a medical condition that warrants restriction from the critical task or duties of the position held. It is also the responsibility of the disability annuitant to obtain and submit evidence OPM requires to show continuing entitlement to disability benefits.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withdrawal of disability retirement applications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) OPM will honor, without question, an applicant's request to withdraw an employee-filed disability retirement application if it receives the withdrawal request before the employing agency has separated the current employee, or, if the employee has already separated from the service, the withdrawal request is received before the official notice of approval has been issued by OPM. Similarly, OPM will honor, without question, an agency's request to withdraw an agency-filed disability retirement application if it receives the withdrawal request before the employee has separated from the service. Once the request to withdraw the application is accepted, an applicant must reapply to receive any further consideration.</P>

              <P>(b) Withdrawal of a disability retirement application does not ensure the individual's continued employment. It <PRTPAGE P="146"/>is the employing agency's responsibility to determine whether it is appropriate to continue to employ the individual.</P>
              <P>(c) OPM considers voluntary acceptance of a permanent position in which the employee has civil service retirement coverage, including a position at a lower grade or pay level, to be a withdrawal of the employee's disability retirement application. The employing agency must notify OPM immediately when an applicant for disability retirement accepts a position of this type.</P>
              <P>(d) OPM also considers a disability retirement application to be withdrawn when the agency reports to OPM that it has reassigned an applicant or an employee has refused a reassignment to a vacant position, or the agency reports to OPM that it has successfully accommodated the medical condition in the employee's current position. Placement consideration is limited only by agency authority and can occur after OPM's allowance of the application up to the date of separation for disability retirement. The employing agency must notify OPM immediately if any of these events occur.</P>
              <P>(e) After OPM allows a disability retirement application and the employee is separated, the application cannot be withdrawn. However, an individual entitled to a disability annuity may decline to accept all or any part of the annuity under the waiver provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8345(d) or request to be found medically recovered under § 831.1208(e) of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Termination of disability annuity because of recovery.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each annuitant receiving disability annuity from the Fund shall be examined under the direction of OPM at the end of 1 year from the date of disability retirement and annually thereafter until the annuitant becomes 60 years of age unless the disability is found by OPM to be permanent in character. OPM may order a medical or other examination at any time to determine the facts relative to the nature and degree of disability of the annuitant. Failure to submit to reexamination shall result in suspension of annuity.</P>
              <P>(b) A disability annuitant may request medical reevaluation under the provisions of this section at any time. OPM will reevaluate the medical condition of disability annuitants age 60 or over only on their own request.</P>
              <P>(c) Recovery based on medical documentation. When an examination or reevaluation shows that a disability annuitant has medically recovered from the disability, OPM will terminate the annuity effective on the first day of the month beginning 1 year after the date of the medical examination showing recovery.</P>
              <P>(d) Recovery based on reemployment by the Federal Government. Reemployment by an agency at any time before age 60 is evidence of recovery if the reemployment is in a permanent position at the same or higher grade or pay level as the position from which the disability annuitant retired. The permanent position must be full-time unless the position the disability annuitant occupied immediately before retirement was less than full-time, in which case the permanent position must have a work schedule of no less time than that of the position from which the disability annuitant retired. In this instance, OPM needs no medical documentation to find the annuitant recovered. Disability annuity payments will terminate effective on the first day of the month following the month in which the recovery finding is made under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(e) Recovery based on a voluntary request. OPM will honor a written and signed statement of medical recovery voluntarily filed by a disability annuitant when the medical documentation on file does not demonstrate that the annuitant is mentally incompetent. OPM needs no other documentation to find the annuitant recovered. Disability annuity payments will terminate effective on the first day of the month beginning 1 year after the date of the statement. A disability annuitant can withdraw the statement only if the withdrawal is received by OPM before annuity payments terminate.</P>

              <P>(f) When an agency reemploys a recovered disability annuitant at any grade or rate of pay within the 1-year <PRTPAGE P="147"/>period pending termination of the disability retirement benefit under paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, OPM will terminate the annuity effective on the date of reemployment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Termination of disability annuity because of restoration to earning capacity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Restoration to earning capacity.</E> If a disability annuitant is under age 60 on December 31 of any calendar year and his or her income from wages or self-employment or both during that calendar year equal at least 80 percent of the current rate of basic pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement, the annuitant's earning capacity is considered to be restored. The disability annuity will terminate on the June 30 after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is restored. When an agency reemploys a restored disability annuitant at any grade or rate of pay within the 180-day waiting period pending termination of the disability retirement benefit, OPM will terminate the annuity effective on the date of reemployment.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Current rate of basic pay for the position occupied immediately before retirement.</E> (1) A disability annuitant's income for a calendar year is compared to the gross annual rate of basic pay in effect on December 31 of that year for the position occupied immediately before retirement. The income for most disability annuitants is based on the rate for the grade and step which reflects the total amount of basic pay (both the grade and step and any additional basic pay) in effect on the date of separation from the agency for disability retirement. Additional basic pay is included subject to the premium pay restrictions of 5 U.S.C. 5545 (c)(1) and (c)(2). A higher grade and step will be established if it results from using either the date of application for disability retirement or the date of reasonable accommodation, as adjusted by any increases in basic pay that would have been effected between each respective date and the date of final separation. Use of these two alternative pay setting methods is subject to paragraph (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. The highest grade and step established as a result of setting pay under the normal method and the two alternative methods is designated as the rate of basic pay for the position occupied immediately before retirement and applies only to restoration to earning capacity decisions. In cases involving use of either of the two alternative pay setting methods, the determination of the rate of basic pay for the position occupied immediately before retirement is made by the employing agency at the time the disability retirement is allowed. OPM must review the rate so determined to establish whether the correct rate has been established, and will inform the employee of the proper rate at the time the disability annuity is awarded. This rate of basic pay becomes the basis for all future earning capacity determinations.</P>
              <P>(i) The “date of application for disability retirement” is the date the application is signed by the authorized official of the employing agency immediately before forwarding the application to OPM.</P>
              <P>(ii) The “date of reasonable accommodation” is the date of the employing agency's notice of reasonable accommodation to an employee's medical condition (as a result of its review of medical documentation) which results in a reduction in the rate of basic pay. The use of the date of reasonable accommodation to establish the rate of basic pay for the position held at retirement is subject to the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(A) The date of the employing agency's notice to provide accommodation is no more than 1 year before the date the disability retirement application is signed by the authorized official in the employing agency immediately before forwarding it to OPM; and</P>

              <P>(B) A complete record of the date of the personnel decision, the medical documentation substantiating the existence of the medical condition, and the justification for the accommodation is established in writing and included at the time the agency submits the application for disability retirement. OPM will review the record to determine whether the medical documentation demonstrates that the medical condition existed at the time of the accommodation and warranted the accommodation made.<PRTPAGE P="148"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) In the case of an annuitant whose basic pay rate on the date determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section did not match a specific grade and step in a pay schedule:</P>
              <P>(i) For those retiring from a merit pay position, a position for which a special pay rate is authorized (except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section), or any other position in which the rate of basic pay is not equal to a grade and step in a pay schedule, the grade and step will be established for this purpose at the lowest step in the pay schedule grade that is equal to or greater than the actual rate of basic pay payable. This rule will not be applied when the rate exceeds that of the schedule applicable to the organization from which the individual retired, when there is no existing apposite schedule with grades and steps, or in other organizations which are excluded from coverage of schedules with grades and steps, as in the case of pay systems using pay bands.</P>
              <P>(ii) For those retiring with a retained rate of basic pay or from a position for which a special pay rate is in effect but whose rate of basic pay exceeds the highest rate payable in the pay schedule grade applicable to the position held, the grade and step is established for this purpose in the grade in the schedule that is closest to the grade of the position held and within which the amount of the retained pay falls. The step is established for this purpose at the lowest step in that grade which equals or exceeds the actual rate of pay payable.</P>
              <P>(iii) When the pay system under which an annuitant retired has been either modified or eliminated since the individual retired, the individual will be treated as if he or she had been employed at their retirement grade and step at the time of the system change, and will be deemed to have been placed under the new system using whatever rules would have been applicable at that time. This will only apply when a pay system has been abolished or modified, and not when the grade and step of a position has been modified subsequent to retirement by reclassification or other action, in which case the grade and step in effect at the time of retirement will control.</P>
              <P>(iv) If using the above rules it is not possible to set a grade and step for computing the current rate of pay, then if possible the current rate of pay will be set using the relative position in the range of pay applicable to the position from which the individual retired. For example, if at the time of retirement the rate of pay was $75,000 in a range from $70,000 to $90,000, for all future determinations, the current rate of pay would be 25% up the new pay range from the bottom. If the new range was $96,000 to $120,000, then the new current rate of pay would be $102,000 ($96,000 plus 0.25 times $24,000 ($120,000 minus $96,000)).</P>
              <P>(v) In those cases, such as of some former Congressional staff employees and others whose pay is not set under a formal system, where none of the above guidelines will yield a current rate of pay, OPM will ascertain the current rate of pay after consultation with the former employing organization, or successor organization.</P>
              <P>(3) For annuitants retiring from the United States Postal Service, only cost-of-living allowances subject to civil service retirement deductions are included in determining the current rate of basic pay of the position held at retirement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Income.</E> Earning capacity for the purposes of this section is demonstrated by an annuitant's ability to earn post-retirement income in a calendar year through personal work efforts or services. The total amount of income from all sources is used to determine earning capacity. This includes income received as gross wages from one or more employers, net earnings from one or more self-employment endeavors, and deferred income that is earned in a calendar year. In determining an annuitant's income for a calendar year, the following considerations apply:</P>

              <P>(1) There are two sources of income: wages and self-employment income. All income which is subject to Federal employment taxes (i.e., social security or Medicare taxes) or self-employment taxes constitutes earned income. In addition, any other income as described in this section also constitutes earned income. The determination of whether a disability annuitant earns wages as <PRTPAGE P="149"/>an employee of an organization or earns income as a self-employed person is based on the usual common law rules applicable in determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship. Whether the relationship exists under the usual common law rules will be determined by OPM after the examination of the particular facts of each case.</P>
              <P>(2) Income earned from one source is not offset by losses from another source. Income earned as wages is not reduced by a net loss from self-employment. The net income from each self-employment endeavor is calculated separately, and the income earned as net earnings from one self-employment endeavor is not reduced by a net loss from another self-employment endeavor. The net incomes from each separate self-employment endeavor are added together to determine the total amount of income from self-employment for a calendar year.</P>
              <P>(3) Only income earned from personal work efforts or services is considered in determining earning capacity. All forms of non-work-related unearned income are excluded. Paragraph (f) of this section includes a representative list of the types of unearned income that are not considered.</P>
              <P>(4) Income earned in a calendar year may only be reduced by certain self-employment business expenses, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section; job-connected expenses incurred because of the disabling condition, as provided in paragraph (g) of this section; and the return from investment allowance, as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Once earned, income cannot be reduced by any other means. Thus, income cannot be lowered by such means as leave buy-back provisions, conversion of wages for paid time to leave without pay or a similar non-paid status, reductions in wages attributable to cash shortages or product losses, etc.</P>
              <P>(5) For determining annual income from wages or self-employment or both, income is earned in the calendar year the annuitant actually renders the personal work effort or service and either actually or constructively receives the remuneration, except as provided under paragraph (c)(7) of this section. For this purpose, income paid on a regular basis (i.e., on a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or similar pay period basis) will be deemed earned in the year in which payment is made in the regular course of business.</P>
              <P>(6) Deferred income is included as income in the calendar year in which it is constructively received. Income is constructively received when it is credited, set apart, or otherwise made available so that the annuitant may draw upon it at any time, or could draw upon it during the calendar year if the annuitant had given notice of the intent to do so. Deferred income includes all earnings, whether in the form of cash or property or applied to provide a benefit for the employee, which are subject to the disability annuitant's designation or assignment. Usually, the earnings are set aside by a salary-reduction agreement, a deferred compensation arrangement, or the designation of specific earnings amounts towards the purchase of non-taxable employee fringe benefits. Thus, any earnings for which the individual has the opportunity to adjust the amount of income received in a calendar year by controlling the remuneration of voluntarily giving up the right to control the remuneration, regardless of whether a written instrument exists, are income for earning capacity purposes.</P>

              <P>(7) The Internal Revenue Code provides exceptions to the general rule on constructive receipt for certain deferred compensation plans which, by their design, defer receipt of income for Federal employment tax purposes as of the later of when services are performed or when there is no substantial risk of forfeiture of the rights to such amount. Even though these special deferred compensation plans defer the constructive receipt of the income for tax purposes to future years beyond the year in which the income is actually earned, the income reflects earning capacity. Therefore, employer contributions and employee payments to these special deferred compensation plans are considered income in the calendar year in which the services are performed, even though the Internal Revenue Code may exclude these contributions and payments from income for tax purposes.<PRTPAGE P="150"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Wages.</E> For purposes of earning capacity determinations, the term “wages” means the gross amount of all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his or her employer, unless specifically excluded herein, before any deductions or withholdings.</P>
              <P>(1) The name by which the remuneration for services is designated is immaterial. Remuneration includes but is not limited to one-time or recurring—</P>
              <P>(i) Base salary or pay; tips; commissions; professional fees; honoraria; bonuses and gift certificates of any type; golden parachute payments; payments for any non-work periods, such as vacation, holiday, or sick pay; pay advances; overtime pay; severance pay; dismissal pay; termination pay; and back pay;</P>
              <P>(ii) Deferred income, within the meaning of paragraphs (c) (6) and (7) of this section, or other employer contributions or payments in an arrangement in which the employee has the opportunity (whether exercised or not) to adjust income by recovering the contributions or payments during the calendar year in which earned, for general discretionary income purposes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Non-cash wages or payment of in-kind benefits, such as shares of stock in the business, real or personal property, stock in trade, inventory items, goods, lodging, food, and clothing. The valuation for all non-cash wages or other in-kind benefits is determined in a manner consistent with the fair value standards that appear in the Social Security Administration's regulations at 20 CFR 404.1041(d).</P>
              <P>(2) Any amount offset or deducted under 5 U.S.C. 8344 is treated as wages if the annuity continues while the annuitant is reemployed by the Federal Government.</P>
              <P>(3) As a general rule, remuneration as wages does not include any contribution, payment, benefits furnished, or service provided by an employer in any of the following areas:</P>
              <P>(i) The general retirement system established by the employer for its employees, usually either a qualified pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus plan, or a qualified annuity contract plan;</P>
              <P>(ii) Medical or hospitalization health benefit plans;</P>
              <P>(iii) Life insurance plans;</P>
              <P>(iv) Sickness or accident disability pay beyond 6 months of illness, or workers' compensation payments;</P>
              <P>(v) The value of meals and lodgings provided at the convenience of the employer;</P>
              <P>(vi) Moving expenses;</P>
              <P>(vii) Educational assistance programs;</P>
              <P>(viii) Dependent care assistance programs;</P>
              <P>(ix) Scholarships and fellowship grants;</P>
              <P>(x) De minimis fringe benefits, such as items of merchandise given by the employer at holidays which are not readily convertible into cash and courtesy discounts on company products offered not as remuneration for services performed but as a means of promoting good will;</P>
              <P>(xi) Qualified group legal services plans;</P>
              <P>(xii) Uniforms and tools supplied by the employer, including employer-provided allowances for such items, for the exclusive use by the employee on the job; and</P>
              <P>(xiii) Amounts that an employer pays the individual specifically, either as advances or reimbursements, for traveling or other ordinary and necessary expenses incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred in the employer's business.</P>
              <P>(4) However, there are two exceptions to this general rule:</P>
              <P>(i) When it is provided under circumstances in which either a salary reduction or deferral agreement is used (whether evidenced by a written instrument or otherwise); or</P>
              <P>(ii) When the employee had the opportunity (whether exercised or not) to elect to receive the cash value, whether in the form of money or personal or real property, of the employer-provided amount or service.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Self-employment income.</E> (1) Self-employment income is the remuneration that is received as an independent contractor, either as</P>
              <P>(i) A sole proprietor of a business or farm;</P>
              <P>(ii) A professional in one's own practice; or</P>

              <P>(iii) A member of a partnership or corporation, as these terms are defined <PRTPAGE P="151"/>by the Internal Revenue Code, and regardless of whether the business entity is operated for profit.</P>
              <P>(2) The term “net earnings” from self-employment in a business enterprise means the gross revenue to the business endeavor from all sources before any other deductions or withholdings, minus</P>
              <P>(i) Allowable business expenses, as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) Any job-connected disability expenses, as provided in paragraph (g) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any return from investment allowance, as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Certain expenses of a self-employed business entity may be offset from the gross revenue from all sources of that self-employed business in determining the amount of net earnings for a particular calendar year. Expenses which may be deducted are only those items and costs which are permitted by the Internal Revenue Code for income tax purposes as ordinary and necessary to the operation of the business. However, expenses incurred on behalf of the disability annuitant may not be deducted, regardless of whether they are permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. These expenses that are incurred but cannot be deducted include the costs for wages paid to the individual, interest earnings, guaranteed payments, dividends, employee benefits, pension plans, and salary reduction or deferral plans. Also, self-employed disability annuitants may not deduct the costs of other withdrawals or expenses which are not used solely for business purposes. Examples of items that cannot be deducted if used at all for personal use by the self-employed disability annuitant include personal property items, such as automobiles and boats; real property, such as vacation property or residences; and memberships, dues, or fees for professional associations or public or private organizations or clubs.</P>
              <P>(4) Fees paid to an annuitant as a director of a corporation are a part of net earnings from self-employment.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Income not included.</E> Other types of income not considered in determining earning capacity include—</P>
              <P>(1) Investment income, such as interest or dividends from savings accounts, stocks, personal loans or home mortgages held, unless the disability annuitant receives the return from capital investment in the course of his or her trade or business;</P>
              <P>(2) Capital gains from sales of real or personal property that the disability annuitant owns, unless received in the course of his or her trade or business:</P>
              <P>(3) Rents or royalties, unless received in the course of his or her trade or business;</P>
              <P>(4) Distributions from pension plans, annuity plans, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA's), Simplified Employee Benefit-IRA's (SEP-IRA's), Keogh Accounts, employee stock ownership plans, profit sharing plans, or deferred income payments that are received by the annuitant in any year after the calendar year in which the funds were contributed to the plan;</P>
              <P>(5) Income earned before the commencing date of civil service retirement annuity payments;</P>
              <P>(6) Scholarships or fellowships;</P>
              <P>(7) Proceeds from life insurance, inheritances, estates, trusts, endowments, gifts, prizes, awards, gambling or lottery winnings, and amounts received in court actions whether by verdict or settlement, unless received in the course of their trade or business;</P>
              <P>(8) Unemployment compensation under State or Federal law, supplemental unemployment benefits, or workers' compensation:</P>
              <P>(9) Alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments received;</P>
              <P>(10) Pay for jury duty; and</P>
              <P>(11) Entitlement payments from other Federal agencies, such as benefits from the Social Security Administration or the Veterans Administration, Railroad Retirement System retirement pay, or military retirement pay.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Job-connected expenses incurred because of the disabling condition may be deducted from income.</E> (1) Job-connected expenses deductible from income for purposes of determining earning capacity are those expenses that are primarily for and essential to the annuitant's occupation or business and are directly connected with or result from <PRTPAGE P="152"/>the disability for which the disability annuity was allowed.</P>
              <P>(2) The determination of whether a job-connected expense may be deducted from income is governed by the following considerations:</P>
              <P>(i) The expense must be directly attributable to the disability and must be one which would not have been incurred in the absence of the annuitant working in his or her business or occupation. Expenses incurred for the preservation of the annuitant's health, alleviation of his or her physical or mental discomfort, or other expenses of an employed person cannot be deducted.</P>
              <P>(ii) The disability must be of such severity that it requires the annuitant to use special means of transportation, services, or equipment to perform the duties of the occupation or business. Examples of such disabilities include blindness, paraplegia, multiple sclerosis, and cerebral hemorrhage. Claims involving transportation or equipment may be deducted only in the amount normally allowed for business expenses or as depreciation by the Internal Revenue Service for Federal income tax purposes.</P>
              <P>(iii) Claims involving services performed by a family member or other individual directly employed by the annuitant may be deducted only if a true employer-employee relationship exists between the annuitant and the employed individual, and the amount claimed as an expense does not exceed the local market rate of payment to individuals who provide similar services. It is the responsibility of the annuitant to provide evidence demonstrating that an employer-employee relationship exists, and what the local market rate is for such services. For the purpose of this paragraph, to establish that a true employer-employee relationship exists, the annuitant must provide evidence that all statutorily mandated employment requirements are met, including (but not limited to) income tax withholdings, FICA tax deductions and payments, and unemployment insurance. If the annuitant fails to provide evidence of the local market rate for such services, payments may be deducted only if the amount claimed does not exceed the Federal minimum hourly rate in effect on December 31 of the calendar year in which claimed. Absent evidence that it is customary and regular practice in the local labor market to work more hours per week, payment may not be deducted for services provided by an individual in excess of 40 hours a week.</P>
              <P>(3) A job-connected expense can be deducted only in the calendar year in which paid.</P>
              <P>(4) Claims for items used for both personal and job-related purposes may be deducted only by the prorated amount attributable to the job-related use.</P>
              <P>(5) A job-connected expense may not be deducted from income from self-employment if the expense has already been deducted as a business expense.</P>
              <P>(6) It is the responsibility of the annuitant claiming job-connected expense to provide adequate documentation to substantiate the amount claimed. Adequate documentation will generally include the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) Written recommendation of a physician, vocational rehabilitation specialist, occupational health resource specialist, or other similar professional specialist that the retiree should use the transportation, services, or equipment;</P>
              <P>(ii) A description of the item and an explanation of its use by the annuitant in the performance of his or her occupation or business;</P>
              <P>(iii) A copy of the receipt of purchase, bill of sale, or leasing agreement for the item claimed with the date, duration of the agreement, and agreed upon price clearly specified;</P>
              <P>(iv) A complete supporting explanation of how the amount claimed for the job-connected expense has been calculated; and</P>
              <P>(v) An explanation of the circumstances and calculation of the prorated cost of the item if used for both personal and business use.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Return from investment allowance.</E> A disability annuitant may reduce the net earnings from a self-employed business endeavor (adjusted for any interest paid on borrowed capital) by 6 percent of his or her capital investment in that business, owned or borrowed. The capital investment's value is its fair-market value as of December 31 of the <PRTPAGE P="153"/>year for which the income is being reported.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Requirement to report income.</E> All disability annuitants who, on December 31 of any calendar year, are under age 60 must report to OPM their income from wages or self-employment or both for that calendar year. Each year as early as possible, OPM will send a form to annuitants to use in reporting their income from the previous calendar year. The form specifies the date by which OPM must receive the report. OPM will determine entitlement to continued annuity on the basis of the report. If an annuitant fails to submit the report, OPM may stop annuity payments until it receives the report.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Annuity rights after a disability annuity terminates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An individual is entitled to an immediate annuity when the disability annuity stops because of recovery or restoration to earning capacity if the individual is not reemployed in a position subject to civil service retirement coverage and—</P>
              <P>(1) Is at least age 50 when the disability annuity stops and had 20 or more years of service at the time of retirement for disability; or</P>
              <P>(2) Had 25 or more years of service at the time of retirement for disability regardless of age.</P>
              <P>(b) An individual whose annuity stops because of recovery or restoration to earning capacity and who is not eligible for an immediate annuity under paragraph (a) of this section, is eligible for a deferred annuity upon reaching age 62.</P>
              <P>(c) The disability annuity of an individual whose annuity stopped because of recovery or restoration to earning capacity may be reinstated under § 831.1212 of this part.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 831.1211</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Reinstatement of disability annuity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When a disability annuity stops, the individual must again prove that he or she meets the eligibility requirements in order to have the annuity reinstated.</P>
              <P>(b) When a recovered disability annuitant under age 62 whose annuity was terminated because he or she was found recovered on the basis of medical evidence (§ 831.1208(b)), is not reemployed in a position subject to civil service retirement coverage, and, based on the results of a current medical examination, OPM finds that the individual's medical condition has worsened since the finding of recovery and that the original disability on which retirement was based has recurred, OPM will reinstate the disability annuity. The right to the reinstated annuity begins with the date of the medical examination showing that the disability recurred.</P>
              <P>(c) OPM will reinstate the disability annuity of a recovered disability annuitant under age 62 whose annuity was terminated because he or she was found recovered on the basis of Federal reemployment (§ 831.1208(c)) when—</P>
              <P>(1) The results of a current medical examination show that the disabling medical condition that was the basis of the disability retirement continues to exist; and</P>
              <P>(2) Within 1 year after the date of reemployment, this medical condition has again caused the individual to be unable to provide useful and efficient service, and the employee has been—</P>
              <P>(i) Separated and not reemployed in a position subject to civil service retirement coverage; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Placed in a position that results in a reduction in grade or pay below the grade from which the individual retired, or in a change to a non-permanent position. The right to the reinstated annuity begins with the date of the medical examination showing that the disabling medical condition continues to exist, but not earlier than the first day after separation, or the effective date of the placement in the position which results in a reduction in grade or pay or change to a non-permanent position.</P>

              <P>(d) When a recovered disability annuitant under age 62 whose annuity was terminated because he or she was found recovered on the basis of a voluntary request (§ 831.1208(e)), is not reemployed in a position subject to civil service retirement coverage, and, based on the results of a current medical examination, OPM finds that the disability has recurred, OPM will reinstate the disability annuity. The right to the reinstated annuity begins with the date of <PRTPAGE P="154"/>the medical examination showing that the disability recurred, but not earlier than 1 year before the date the request for reinstatement is received by OPM.</P>
              <P>(e) When a disability annuitant whose earning capacity has been restored but who is not reemployed in a position in which he or she is subject to civil service retirement coverage, and who (except in the case of a National Guard technician whose annuity was awarded under 5 U.S.C. 8337(h)), has not recovered from the disability for which retired, loses his or her earning capacity, as determined by OPM, before reaching age 62, OPM will reinstate the disability annuity. The reinstated annuity is payable from January 1 of the year following the calendar year in which earning capacity was lost. Earning capacity is lost if, during any calendar year, the individual's income from wages or self-employment or both is less than 80 percent of the current rate of basic pay of the position held at retirement.</P>
              <P>(f) A reinstated annuity is the same type as the original annuity and is paid at the rate of annuity to which the annuitant was entitled on the date his or her disability annuity was last discontinued.</P>
              <P>(g) Reinstatement of the disability annuity ends the right to any other annuity based on the same service, unless the annuitant makes a written election to receive the other annuity instead of the disability annuity.</P>
              <P>(h) When OPM reinstates an employee's disability annuity, the agency must offset the employee's pay by the amount of annuity allocable to the period of employment, unless the annuitant is exempted from this requirement under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8344(i). The offset begins on the date of OPM's determination of eligibility for reinstatement. OPM must reduce any retroactive payment of annuity for a period of employment with an agency before that date by the amount of pay earned during that period.</P>
              <P>(i) When an individual's annuity is terminated upon reemployment (subject to subchapter III of chapter 83, title 5, United States Code), OPM must determine the individual's future annuity rights under the law in effect at the date of his or her subsequent separation. If, upon separation from such reemployment, the individual does not meet the eligibility requirements under subchapter III of chapter 83, title 5, United States Code, for title to annuity based on such separation, OPM will resume payment of the terminated annuity at the rate last payable, unless payment is otherwise barred.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Collection of debts.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Means of collection.</E> Collection of a debt may be made by means of offset under § 831.1306, or under any statutory provision providing for offset of money due the debtor from the Federal Government, or by referral to the Justice Department for litigation, as provided in § 831.1306. Referral may also be made to a collection agency under the provisions of the FCCS.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional charges.</E> Interest, penalties, and administrative costs will be assessed on the debt in accordance with standards established in the FCCS at 4 CFR 102.13. Additional charges will be waived when required by the FCCS. In addition, such charges may be waived when OPM determines—</P>
              <P>(1) Collection would be against equity and good conscience under the standards prescribed in §§ 831.1403 through 831.1405 of this part; or</P>
              <P>(2) Waiver would be in the best interest of the United States.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Collection in installments.</E> Whenever feasible, debts will be collected in one lump sum. However, when the debtor is financially unable to pay in one lump sum of fails to respond to a demand for full payment and off-set is available, installment payments may be effected. The amount of the installment payments will be set in accordance with the criteria in 4 CFR 102.11.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Commencement of collection.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, collection will begin after the time limits for requesting further rights stated in § 831.1304(a)(6) expire or OPM has issued decisions on all timely requests for those rights and the Merit Systems Protection Board has acted on any timely appeal of a waiver denial, unless: (i) Failure to make an offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and (ii) the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of the proceedings in § 831.1304 or litigation. When offset begins without completion of the administrative review process, these procedures will be completed promptly, and amounts recovered by offset but later found not owed will be refunded promptly.</P>

              <P>(2) The procedures identified in § 831.1304 will not be applied when the debt is caused by (i) a retroactive adjustment in the periodic rate of annuity or any deduction taken from annuity when the adjustment is a result of the annuitant's election of different entitlements under law, if the adjustment is made within 120 days of the effective date of the election; or (ii) interim, estimated payments made before the formal determination of entitlement to annuity, if the amount is recouped from the total annuity payable on the first day of the month following the last advance payment or the date the <PRTPAGE P="157"/>formal determination is made, whichever is later.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Offset from other payments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Administrative offset.</E> (i) A debt may be offset from other payments due the debtor from other agencies in accordance with 4 CFR 102.3, except that offset from back pay awarded under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5596 (and 5 CFR 550.801 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) will be made in accordance with § 550.805(e)(2) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) In determining whether to collect claims by means of administrative offset after the expiration of the six year limitation provided in 5 U.S.C. 2415, the Director or his designee will determine the cost effectiveness of leaving a claim unresolved for more than 6 years. This decision will be based on such factors as the amount of the debt; the cost of collection; and the likelihood of recovering the debt.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Salary offset.</E> When the debtor is an employee, or a member of the Armed Forces or a reserve component of the Armed Forces, OPM may effect collection action by offset of the debtor's pay in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1101 <E T="03">et seq.</E> Due process described in § 831.1304 will apply. The questions of fact and liability, and entitlements to waiver or compromise determined through that process are deemed correct and will not be amended under salary offset procedures. When the debtor did not receive a hearing on the amount of the offset under § 831.1304 and requests such hearing, one will be conducted in accordance with subpart K of part 550 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(1) The individual's name, address, taxpayer identification number, and any other information necessary to establish the identity of the individual;</P>

              <P>Recovery of an overpayment from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund may be waived pursuant to section 8346(b), of title 5, United States Code, when the annuitant (a) is without fault and (b) recovery would be against equity and good conscience. Where it has been determined that the recipient of an overpayment is ineligible for waiver, the individual is nevertheless entitled to an adjustment in the recovery schedule if he/she shows that it would cause him/her financial hardship to make payment at the rate scheduled.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fault.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A recipient of an overpayment is without fault if he/she performed no act of commission or omission which resulted in the overpayment. The fact that the Office of Personnel Management may have been at fault in initiating an overpayment will not necessarily relieve the individual from liability.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Considerations.</E> Pertinent considerations in finding fault are—</P>
              <P>(1) Whether payment resulted from the individual's incorrect but not necessarily fraudulent statement, which he/she should have known to be incorrect;</P>
              <P>(2) Whether payment resulted from the individual's failure to disclose material facts in his/her possession which he/she should have known to be material; or</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Considerations.</E> Some pertinent considerations in determining whether recovery would cause financial hardship are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The individual's financial ability to pay <E T="03">at the time collection is scheduled to be made.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by the employing agency head to be a primary customs and border protection officer position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).</P>
              <P>(b) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to a primary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) for any purpose under this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Conditions for coverage in secondary positions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by the employing agency head to be a secondary position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) if all of the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The employee is transferred directly (i.e., without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary position; and</P>
              <P>(2) The employee has completed 3 years of service in a primary position, including a position for which no CSRS deductions were withheld; and</P>
              <P>(3) If applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in secondary positions since transferring from a primary position without a break in service exceeding 3 days, except that a break in employment in secondary positions which begins with an involuntary separation (not for cause), within the meaning of 8336(d)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is not considered in determining whether the service in secondary positions is continuous for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purpose of applying the criteria at paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section to evaluate transfers, service, and employment periods that occurred before September 1, 2007—</P>
              <P>(1) A primary position is deemed to include:</P>
              <P>(i) A position whose duties included the performance of work directly connected with activities relating to the arrival and departure of persons, conveyances, and merchandise at ports of entry that was classified within the Immigration Inspector Series (GS-1816), Customs Inspector Series (GS-1890), Canine Enforcement Officer Series (GS-1801), or any other series which the agency head determines were predecessor series to the Customs and Border Protection Series (GS-1895), and that would have been classified under the GS-1895 series had it then existed; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A position within the Customs and Border Protection Series (GS-1895) whose duties included the performance of work directly connected with activities relating to the arrival and departure of persons, conveyances, and merchandise at ports of entry.</P>
              <P>(2) A secondary position is deemed to include:</P>
              <P>(i) A first-level supervisor of an employee in a position described at paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An executive, managerial, technical, semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a position described at paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section is a mandatory prerequisite.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Evidence.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An agency head's determination under §§ 831.1603(a) and 831.1604(a) must be based solely on the official position description of the position in question and any other official description of duties and qualifications.</P>
              <P>(b) If an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. 8334(c), and the employee does not, within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position, formally and in writing seek a determination from the employing agency that his position is properly covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is presumed to be correct. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requests from individuals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An employee who requests credit for service under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) bears the burden of proof with respect to that service, and must provide the employing agency with all pertinent information regarding duties performed.</P>
              <P>(b) An employee who is currently serving in a position that has not been approved as a primary or secondary position, but who believes that his or her service is creditable as service in a primary or secondary position may request the agency head to determine whether or not the employee's current service should be credited and, if it qualifies, whether it should be credited as service in a primary or secondary position. A written request for current service must be made within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position.</P>
              <P>(c) A current or former employee (or the survivor of a former employee) who believes that a period of past service in an unapproved position qualifies as service in a primary or secondary position and meets the conditions for credit may request the agency head to determine whether or not the employee's past service should be credited and, if it qualifies, whether it should be credited as service in a primary or secondary position. A written request for past service must be made no later than June 30, 2012.</P>
              <P>(d) The agency head may extend the time limit for filing under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section when, in the judgment of such agency head, the individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withholdings and contributions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) During the service covered under the conditions established by § 831.1603 and § 831.1604, the Department of Homeland Security will deduct and withhold from the employee's base pay the amount required under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a) for such positions and submit that amount, together with agency contributions required by 5 U.S.C. 8334(a), to OPM in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.</P>
              <P>(b) If the correct withholdings and/or Government contributions are not submitted to OPM for any reason whatsoever, the Department of Homeland Security must correct the error by submitting the correct amounts (including both employee and agency shares) to OPM as soon as possible. Even if the Department of Homeland Security waives collection of the overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be available for this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to collect the debt, the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM without delay as soon as possible.</P>

              <P>(c) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or eligible survivor of a former employee, the Department of Homeland Security will pay a refund of erroneous additional withholdings for service that is found not to have been covered service. If an individual has paid to OPM a deposit or redeposit, including the additional amount required for covered service, and the deposit or redeposit is later determined to be erroneous because the <PRTPAGE P="163"/>service was not covered service, OPM will pay the refund, upon proper application, to the individual, without interest.</P>
              <P>(d) The additional employee withholding and agency contribution for covered or creditable service properly made as required under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a)(1) or deposited under 5 U.S.C. 8334(c) are not separately refundable, even in the event that the employee or his or her survivor does not qualify for a special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 8339(d).</P>
              <P>(e) While an employee who does not hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will not be made. While an employee who does hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a position which is not a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will continue to be made.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Mandatory separation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) apply to customs and border protection officers appointed in primary and secondary positions. A mandatory separation under section 8335(b) is not an adverse action under part 752 of this chapter or a removal action under part 359 of this chapter. Section 831.502 provides the procedures for requesting an exemption from mandatory separation.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 U.S.C. 8335(b), or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c), and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service required for entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position which did not meet the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the conditions set forth in this subpart, such separation will be considered erroneous.</P>
              <P>(c) The customs and border protection officer mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) do not apply to an individual first appointed as a customs and border protection officer before July 6, 2008.</P>

              <P>(b) The final decision of the agency head denying an individual coverage while serving in an approved secondary position because of failure to meet the conditions in § 831.1604(a) may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.</P>

              <P>(3) An individual eligible to make an election under this paragraph who fails to make such an election on or before June 22, 2008, is deemed to have elected to be treated as a customs and border protection officer for retirement purposes.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exclusion from coverage.</E> The provisions of this subpart and any other specific reference to customs and border protection officers in this part do not apply to employees who on December 25, 2007, were law enforcement officers under subpart I of this part or subpart H of part 842 within U.S. Customs and Border Protection. These employees cannot elect to be treated as a customs and border protection officer under paragraph (a) of this section, nor can they be deemed to have made such an election.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 831.1715</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Effect of phased retirement.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a)(1) A phased retiree is deemed to be a full-time employee for the purpose of 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 and 5 CFR part 890 (related to health benefits), as required by 5 U.S.C. 8336a(i). The normal rules governing health benefits premiums for part-time employees in 5 U.S.C. 8906(b)(3) do not apply.</P>
                <P>(2) A phased retiree is deemed to be receiving basic pay at the rate applicable to a full-time employee holding the same position for the purpose of determining a phased retiree's annual rate of basic pay used in calculating premiums (employee withholdings and agency contributions) and benefits under 5 U.S.C. chapter 87 and 5 CFR part 870 (dealing with life insurance), as required by 5 U.S.C. 8336a(n). The deemed full-time schedule will consist of five 8-hour workdays each workweek, resulting in a 40-hour workweek. Only basic pay for hours within the deemed full-time schedule will be considered, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 8336a(n) and the definition of “full-time” in § 831.1702. Any premium pay creditable as basic pay for life insurance purposes under 5 CFR 870.204 for overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule that an employee was receiving before phased retirement, such as standby duty pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1) or customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), may not be considered in determining a phased retiree's deemed annual rate of basic pay under this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(b) A phased retiree may not be appointed to more than one position at the same time.</P>
                <P>(c) A phased retiree may move to another position in the agency or another agency during phased retirement status only if the change would not result in a change in the working percentage. To move to another agency during phased retirement status and continue phased employment and phased retirement status, the phased retiree must submit a written and signed request and obtain the signed written approval, in accordance with § 831.1713(a)(1) and (2), of the authorized agency official of the agency to which the phased retiree is moving. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 831.1714, if the authorized agency official approves the request, the phased retiree's phased employment and phased retirement status will continue without interruption at the agency to which the phased retiree moves. If the authorized agency official at the agency to which the phased retiree moves does not approve the request, phased employment and phased retirement status terminates in accordance with § 831.1722(b).</P>
                <P>(d) A phased retiree may be detailed to another position or agency, subject to 5 CFR part 300, subpart C, if the working percentage of the position to which detailed is the same as the working percentage of the phased retiree's position of record.</P>
                <P>(e) A retirement-eligible employee who makes an election under this subpart may not elect an alternative annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8343a.</P>
                <P>(f) If the employee's election of phased retirement status becomes effective, the employee is barred from electing phased retirement status again. Ending phased retirement status or entering full retirement status does not create a new opportunity for the individual to elect phased retirement status.</P>
                <P>(g) Except as otherwise expressly provided by law or regulation, a phased retiree is treated as any other employee on a part-time tour of duty for all other purposes.</P>
                <P>(h)(1) A phased retiree may not be assigned hours of work in excess of the officially established part-time schedule (reflecting the working percentage), except under the conditions specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) An authorized agency official may order or approve a phased retiree to perform hours of work in excess of the officially established part-time schedule only in rare and exceptional circumstances meeting all of the following conditions:</P>

                <P>(i) The work is necessary to respond to an emergency posing a significant, <PRTPAGE P="168"/>immediate, and direct threat to life or property;</P>
                <P>(ii) The authorized agency official determines that no other qualified employee is available to perform the required work;</P>
                <P>(iii) The phased retiree is relieved from performing excess work as soon as reasonably possible (e.g., by management assignment of work to other employees); and</P>
                <P>(iv) When an emergency situation can be anticipated in advance, agency management made advance plans to minimize any necessary excess work by the phased retiree.</P>
                <P>(3) Employing agencies must inform each phased retiree and his or her supervisor of—</P>
                <P>(i) The limitations on hours worked in excess of the officially established part-time schedule;</P>
                <P>(ii) The requirement to maintain records documenting that exceptions met all required conditions;</P>
                <P>(iii) The fact that, by law and regulation, any basic pay received for hours outside the employee's officially established part-time work schedule (as described in § 831.1712(a)(1) and (b)) is subject to retirement deductions and agency contributions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8336a(d), but is not used in computing retirement benefits; and</P>
                <P>(iv) The fact that, by law and regulation, any premium pay received for overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule, that would otherwise be basic pay for retirement, such as customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), will not be subject to retirement deductions or agency contributions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8336a(d), and that any such premium pay received will not be included in computing retirement benefits.</P>
                <P>(4) Employing agencies must maintain records documenting that exceptions granted under paragraph (h)(2) of this section meet the required conditions. These records must be retained for at least 6 years and be readily available to auditors. OPM may require periodic agency reports on the granting of exceptions and of any audit findings.</P>
                <P>(5) If OPM finds that an agency (or subcomponent) is granting exceptions that are not in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (h), OPM may administratively withdraw the agency's (or subcomponent's) authority to grant exceptions and require OPM approval of any exception.</P>
                <P>(6) If OPM finds that a phased retiree has been working a significant amount of excess hours beyond the officially established part-time schedule to the degree that the intent of the phased retirement law is being undermined, OPM may require that the agency end the individual's phased retirement by unilateral action, notwithstanding the normally established methods of ending phased retirement. This finding does not need to be based on a determination that the granted exceptions failed to meet the required conditions in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. With the ending of an individual's phased retirement, that individual must be returned to regular employment status on the same basis as a person making an election under § 831.1721—unless that individual elects to fully retire as provided under § 831.1731.</P>
                <P>(7) A phased retiree must be compensated for excess hours of work in accordance with the normally applicable pay rules.</P>
                <P>(8) Any premium pay received for overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule that would otherwise be basic pay for retirement, such as customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), is not subject to retirement deductions or agency contributions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8336a(d).</P>
                <P>(i) A phased retiree is deemed to be an annuitant for the purpose of subpart S of 5 CFR part 831.</P>

                <P>(a) After phased retirement status ends under § 831.1722, the employee's rights under subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, are determined based on the law in effect at the time of any subsequent separation from service.</P>

                <P>(b) After an individual ends phased retirement status to return to regular employment status, for the purposes of subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, at the time of the subsequent separation from service, the phased retirement period will be treated as if it had been a period of part-time employment with the work schedule described in § 831.1712(a)(1) and (b). The part-time proration adjustment for the phased retirement period will be based upon the individual's officially established part-time work schedule, with no credit for extra hours worked. In determining the <PRTPAGE P="170"/>individual's deemed rate of basic pay during the phased retirement period, only basic pay for hours within the individual's officially established part-time work schedule may be considered.

                <P>(ii) The amount of an annuity computed under 5 U.S.C. 8339 that would have been payable at the time of full retirement if the individual had not elected phased retirement status and as if the individual was employed on a full-time basis in the position occupied during the phased retirement period and before any reduction for survivor annuity.</P>
                <P>(2) In applying paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the individual must be deemed to have a full-time schedule during the period of phased retirement. The deemed full-time schedule will consist of five 8-hour workdays each workweek, resulting in a 40-hour workweek. In determining the individual's deemed rate of basic pay during phased retirement, only basic pay for hours within the deemed full-time schedule will be considered, consistent with the definition of “full-time” in § 831.1702. Any premium pay creditable as basic pay for retirement purposes for overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule that an employee was receiving before phased retirement, such as standby duty pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1) or customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), may not be considered in determining a phased retiree's deemed rate of basic pay during phased retirement.</P>

                <P>(b) A composite retirement annuity under § 831.1742 is increased by cost-of-living adjustments in accordance with <PRTPAGE P="172"/>5 U.S.C. 8340, except that 5 U.S.C. 8340(c)(1) does not apply.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) For the purpose of computing the amount of phased retirement annuity used in the computation under § 831.1742(a)(1), the initial cost-of-living adjustment applied is prorated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8340(c)(1).</P>
                <P>(2) If the individual enters full retirement status on the same day as the effective date of a cost-of-living adjustment (usually December 1st), that cost-of-living adjustment is applied to increase the phased retirement annuity used in the computation under § 831.1742(a)(1).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Conditions for requesting an offset.</SUBJECT>
              <P>An agency may request that money payable from the Fund be offset to recover any valid debt due the United States when all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(a) The debtor failed to pay all of the debt on demand, or the creditor agency has collected as much as possible from payments due the debtor from the paying agency; and</P>
              <P>(b) The creditor agency sends a debt claim to OPM (under § 831.1805(b) (1), (2), (3), or (4), as appropriate) after doing one of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Obtaining a court judgment for the amount of the debt;</P>

              <P>(2) Following the procedures required by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR 102.4;<PRTPAGE P="176"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Following the procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and § 550.1107 of this title; or</P>
              <P>(4) Following the procedures agreed upon by the creditor agency and OPM, if it is excepted by § 831.1805(b)(4) from the completion of procedures prescribed by § 831.1805(b)(3).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Where to submit the debt claim, judgment or notice of debt</E>—(1) <E T="03">Creditor agencies that are not the debtor's paying agency.</E> (i) If the creditor agency knows that the debtor is employed by the Federal Government, it should send the debt claim to the debtor's paying agency for collection.</P>
              <P>(ii) If some of the debt is unpaid after the debtor separates from the paying agency, the creditor agency should send the debt claim to OPM as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Creditor agencies that are the debtor's paying agency.</E> Ordinarily, debts owed the paying agency should be offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 from any final payments (salary, accrued annual leave, etc.) due the debtor. If a balance is due after offsetting the final payments or the debt is discovered after the debtor has been paid, the paying agency may send the debt claim to OPM as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures for submitting a debt claim, judgment or notice of debt to OPM</E>—(1) <E T="03">Debt claims for which the agency has a court judgment.</E> If the creditor agency has a court judgment against the debtor specifying the amount of the debt to be recovered, the agency should send the debt claim and two certified copies of the judgment to OPM.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Debt claims previously processed under 5 U.S.C. 5514.</E> If the creditor agency previously processed the debt claim under section 5514, it should—</P>
              <P>(i) Notify the debtor that the claim is being sent to OPM to complete collection from the Fund; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Send the debt claim (on SF 2805) to OPM with two copies of the paying agency's certification of the amount collected and one copy of the notice to the debtor that the claim was sent to OPM.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Debt claims not processed under 5 U.S.C. 5514, reduced to court judgment, or excepted by paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</E> (i) If the debt claim was not processed under § 5514, reduced to court judgment or excepted by paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the creditor agency must—</P>
              <P>(A) Comply with the procedures required by 4 CFR 102.4—issuing written notice to the debtor of the nature and amount of the debt, the agency's intention to collect by offset, the opportunity to inspect and copy agency records pertaining to the debt, the opportunity to obtain review within the agency of the determination of indebtedness, and the opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the agency to repay the debt; and</P>
              <P>(B) Complete the appropriate debt claim.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the debtor does not respond to the creditor agency's notice within the allotted time and there is no reason to believe that he or she did not receive the notice, the creditor agency may submit the debt claim to OPM after certifying that notice was issued and the debtor failed to reply.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the debtor responds to the notice by requesting a review (or hearing if one is available), the review (or hearing) must be completed before the creditor agency submits the debt claim.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the debtor receives the notice and responds by consenting to the collection, the creditor agency must send a copy of the debtor's consent along with the debt claim.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Debt claims excepted from procedures described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</E> Creditor agencies follow specific procedures approved by OPM, rather than those described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for the collection of—</P>
              <P>(i) Debts due because of the individual's failure to pay health benefits premiums while he or she was in nonpay status or while his or her salary was not sufficient to cover the cost of premiums;</P>
              <P>(ii) Unpaid Federal taxes to be collected by Internal Revenue Service levy;</P>

              <P>(iii) Premiums due because of the annuitant's election of Part B, Medicare <PRTPAGE P="177"/>coverage (retroactive collection limited to 6 months of premiums); or</P>
              <P>(iv) Overpaid military retired pay an annuitant elects in writing to have withheld from his or her annuity.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">General certification requirements for debt claims.</E> Creditor agencies submitting debt claims must certify—</P>
              <P>(i) That the debt is owed to the United States;</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount and reason for the debt and whether additional interest accrues;</P>
              <P>(iii) The date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued;</P>
              <P>(iv) The agency has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and OPM procedures;</P>
              <P>(v) That if a competent administrative or judicial authority issues an order directing OPM to pay a debtor an amount previously paid to the agency (regardless of the reasons behind the order), the agency will reimburse OPM or pay the debtor directly within 15 days of the date of the order (NOTE: OPM may, at its discretion, decline to collect other debt claims sent by an agency that does not abide by this certification.);</P>
              <P>(vi) If the collection will be in installments, the amount or percentage of net annuity in each installment; and,</P>
              <P>(vii) If the debtor does not (in writing) consent to the offset, or does not (in writing) acknowledge receipt of the required notices and procedures, or the creditor agency does not document a judgment offset or a previous salary offset, the action(s) taken to comply with 4 CFR 102.3, including any required hearing or review, and the date(s) the action(s) was taken.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Notice of debt.</E> When a creditor agency cannot send a complete debt claim, it should notify OPM of the existence of the debt so the lump-sum will not be paid before the debt claim arrives.</P>
              <P>(i) The notice to OPM must include a statement that the debt is owed to the United States, the date the debt first accrued, and the basis for and amount of the debt, if known. If the amount of the debt is not known, the agency must establish the amount and notify OPM in writing as soon as possible after submitting the notice.</P>
              <P>(ii) The creditor agency may either notify OPM by making a notation in column 8 [Remarks] under “Fiscal Record” on the Standard Form 2806 (Individual Retirement Record), if the SF 2806 is in its possession, or if not, by submitting a separate document identifying the debtor by name, giving his or her date of birth, social security number, and date of separation, if known.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Time limits for sending records and debt claims to OPM</E>—(1) <E T="03">Time limits for submitting debt claims.</E> Unless there is an application for refund pending, there is no specific time for submitting a debt claim or notice of debt to OPM. Generally, however, agencies must file a debt claim before the statute of limitations expires (4 CFR 102.4(c)) or before a refund is paid. Time limits are imposed (see § 831.1806(a)) when the debtor is eligible for a refund and OPM receives his or her application requesting payment. In the latter situation, creditor agencies must file a complete debt claim within 120 days (or 180 days if the agency requests an extension of time before the refund is paid) of the date OPM requests a complete debt claim.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Time limit for submitting retirement records to OPM.</E> A paying agency must send an individual's SF 2806 to OPM no later than 60 days after the separation, termination, or entrance on duty in a position in which the employee is not covered by the Civil Service Retirement System.</P>

              <SUBJECT>OPM processing for non-fraud claims.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Refunds—incomplete debt claims.</E> (1) If a creditor agency sends OPM a notice of debt or an incomplete debt claim against a refund OPM is processing for payment, OPM will withhold the amount of the debt but will not make any payment to the creditor agency. OPM will notify the creditor agency that the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be completed; and a debt claim must be completed and returned to OPM within 120 days of the date of OPM's notice to the creditor agency. Upon request, OPM will grant the creditor agency one extension of up to 60 days if the request for extension is received before the <PRTPAGE P="178"/>lump-sum payment has been made. The extension will commence on the day after the 120-day period expires so that the total time OPM holds payment of the refund will not exceed 180 days.</P>
              <P>(2) During the period allotted the creditor agency for sending OPM a complete debt claim, OPM will handle the debtor's application for refund under section 8342(a) of title 5, United States Code, in one of two ways:</P>
              <P>(i) If the amount of the debt is known, OPM will notify the debtor of the debt claim against his or her lump-sum credit, withhold the amount of the debt, and pay the balance to the debtor, if any.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the amount of the debt is not known, OPM will not pay any amount to the debtor until the creditor agency certifies the amount of the debt, submits a complete debt claim, or the time limit for submission of the debt claim expires, whichever comes first.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Refunds—complete debt claims</E>—(1) <E T="03">If OPM receives an application from the debtor prior to or at the same time as the agency's debt claim.</E> (i) If a refund has been paid, we will notify the creditor agency there are no funds available for offset. Except in the case of debts due because of the employee's failure to pay health benefits premiums while he or she is in nonpay status or while his or her salary was not sufficient to cover the cost of premiums, creditor agencies should refer to the instructions in the FCCS for other measures to recover the outstanding debt; however, OPM will retain the SF 2805 on file in the event the debtor is once again employed in a position subject to retirement deductions.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a refund is payable, and the creditor agency submits a complete debt claim in accordance with § 831.1805(b) (1), (2), (3), or (4), the debt will be collected from the refund and any balance paid to the debtor. OPM will send the debtor a copy of the debt claim, judgment, consent, or other document, and notify him or her that the creditor agency was paid.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">If OPM has not received an application from the debtor when the agency's debt claim is received.</E> If a debtor has not filed application for a refund, OPM will retain the debt claim for future recovery. OPM will make the collection whenever an application is received, provided the creditor agency <E T="03">initiated</E> the administrative offset before the statute of limitations expired. (See 4 CFR 102.3(b)(3) and 102.4(c).) OPM will notify the creditor agency that it does not have an application from the debtor so that the agency may take other action to recover the debt. (Note: If the recovery action is successful, the creditor agency must notify OPM so it can void the debt claim).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Future recovery.</E> (i) If OPM receives an application for refund within 1 year of the date the agency's debt claim was received <E T="03">and</E> the creditor agency does not indicate that interest is accruing on the debt, the debt will be processed as stated in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If OPM receives an application for refund within 1 year of the date the agency's debt claim was received and the creditor agency indicates that interest accrues on the debt, when necessary, OPM will contact the creditor agency to confirm that the debt is outstanding and request submission in writing, of the total additional accrued interest. OPM will not make interest computations for creditor agencies.</P>
              <P>(iii) When OPM receives an application for refund more than 1 year after the creditor agency's debt claim was received, whether interest accrues or not, OPM will contact the creditor agency to see if the debt is still outstanding and, when necessary, request an update of the interest charges. If the debt is still due, the creditor agency must give the debtor an opportunity to establish that his or her changed financial circumstances, if any, would make the offset unjust. (See 4 CFR 102.4(c).) If the creditor agency determines that offset as requested in the debt claim would be unjust because of the debtor's changed financial circumstances, the agency should permit the debtor to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset. If the agency decides to pursue the offset, it must submit to OPM the requested information and any new instructions within 60 days of the date of OPM's request or the claim may be voided and the balance paid to the individual.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Annuities—incomplete debt claims.</E> If a creditor agency sends OPM notice <PRTPAGE P="179"/>of a debt or an incomplete debt claim against a debtor who is receiving an annuity, OPM will not offset the annuity. OPM will notify the creditor agency that the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be completed; and a debt claim must be completed and sent to OPM. No time limit will be given for the submission of a debt claim against an annuity; however, a complete debt claim must be received within 10 years of the date the Government's right to collect first accrued (4 CFR 102.3(b)(3)).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Annuities—complete debt claims</E>—(1) <E T="03">General</E>—(i) <E T="03">Notice.</E> When OPM receives a complete debt claim and an application for annuity, OPM will offset the annuity, pay the creditor agency, and mail the debtor a copy of the debt claim along with notice of the payment to the creditor agency.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Beginning deductions.</E> If OPM has already established the debtor's annuity payment, deductions will begin with the next available annuity payment. If OPM is in the process of establishing the annuity payments, deductions will not be taken from advance annuity payments, but will begin with the annuity payable on the first day of the month following the last advance payment.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Updating accrued interest.</E> Once OPM has completed a collection, if there are additional accrued interest charges, the creditor agency must contact OPM regarding any additional amount due within 90 days of the date of the final payment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Claims held for future recovery.</E> (i) If OPM receives an application for annuity within 1 year of the date the agency's debt claim was received, the debt will be processed as stated in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If OPM receives an application for annuity more than 1 year after the agency's debt claim was submitted, OPM will contact the creditor agency to see if the debt is still outstanding. If the debt is still due, the creditor agency should permit the debtor to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset if the debtor establishes that his or her changed financial circumstances would make the offset unjust. (See 4 CFR 102.4(c).) If the agency decides to pursue the offset, it must submit the requested information and any new instructions about the collection to OPM.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Limitations on OPM review.</E> In no case will OPM review—</P>
              <P>(1) The merits of a creditor agency's decision with regard to reconsideration, compromise, or waiver; or</P>
              <P>(2) The creditor agency's decision that a hearing was not required in any particular proceeding.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Installment withholdings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When possible, OPM will collect a creditor agency's full claim in one payment from the debtor's refund or annuity.</P>
              <P>(b) If collection must be made from an annuity and the debt is large, the creditor agency must generally accept payment in installments. The responsibility for establishing and notifying the debtor of the amount of the installments belongs to the creditor agency (see § 831.1805(b)(5)). However, OPM will not make an installment deduction for more than 50 percent of net annuity, unless a higher percentage is needed to satisfy a judgment against a debtor within 3 years or the annuitant has consented to the higher amount in writing. All correspondence concerning installment deductions received by OPM will be referred to the creditor agency for consideration.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 831.1808</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Special processing for fraud claims.</SUBJECT>
              <P>When an agency sends a claim indicating fraud, presentation of a false claim, misrepresentation by the debtor or any other party interested in the claim, or any claim based in whole or part on conduct violating the antitrust laws, to the Department of Justice (Justice) for possible treatment as a fraud claim (4 CFR 101.3), the following special procedures apply.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Agency processing.</E> If the debtor is separated or separates while Justice is reviewing the claim, the paying agency must send the SF 2806 to OPM, as required by § 831.1805(c)(2). The agency where the claim arose must send OPM notice that a claim is pending with Justice. (See § 831.1805(b)(6) for instructions on giving OPM a notice of debt.)</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Department of Justice processing.</E> (1) The Attorney General or a designee <PRTPAGE P="180"/>will decide whether a debt claim sent in by an agency will be reserved for collection by Justice as a fraud claim. Upon receiving a possible fraud claim to be collected by offset from the Fund, the Attorney General or a designee must notify OPM. The notice to OPM must contain the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The name, date of birth, and social security number of the debtor;</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount of the possible fraud claim, if known;</P>
              <P>(iii) The basis of the possible fraud claim; and</P>
              <P>(iv) A statement that the claim is being considered as a possible fraud claim, the collection of which is reserved to Justice.</P>
              <P>(2) When there is a pending refund application, the Attorney General or designee must file a complaint seeking a judgment on the claim and send a copy of the complaint to OPM; or as provided in 4 CFR 101.3, refer the claim to the agency where the claim arose and submit a copy of the referral to OPM within 180 days of the date of either notice from the agency that a claim is pending with Justice (paragraph (a) of this section) or notice from Justice that it has received a possible fraud claim (paragraph (b)(1) of this section) whichever is earlier. When the claim is referred to the agency where it arose, the agency must begin administrative collection action under 4 CFR 102.4 and send a complete debt claim to OPM as required in § 831.1805.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">OPM processing against refunds.</E> (1) Upon receipt of a notice under paragraph (a) or (b)(1) of this section, whichever is earlier, OPM will withhold the amount of the debt claim, if known; notify the debtor that the amount of the debt will be withheld from the refund for at least 180 days from the date of the notice that initiated OPM processing; and pay the balance to the debtor. If the amount of the debt claim is not known, OPM will notify the debtor that a debt claim may be offset against his or her refund and that OPM will not pay any amount until either the amount of the debt claim is established, or the time limit for filing a complaint in court or submitting the debt claim expires, whichever comes first.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Attorney General files a complaint and notifies OPM within the applicable 180-day period, OPM will continue to withhold payment of the lump-sum credit until there is a final judgment.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Attorney General refers the claim to the agency where the claim arose (creditor agency) and notifies OPM within the applicable 180-day period, OPM will notify the creditor agency that the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be completed; and a debt claim must be sent to OPM within 120 days of the date of OPM's notice to the creditor agency. At the request of the creditor agency, one extension of time of not more than 60 days will be granted, as provided by § 831.1806(a).</P>
              <P>(4) If OPM is not notified that a complaint has been filed or that the claim has been referred to the creditor agency within the applicable 180-day period, OPM will pay the balance of the refund to the debtor.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">OPM processing against annuities.</E> If the debtor has filed an annuity claim, OPM will not take action against the annuity. OPM will continue to pay the annuity unless and until there is a final judgment for the United States or submission of a complete debt claim.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">OPM collection and payment of the debt.</E> (1) If the United States obtains a judgment against the debtor for the amount of the debt or the creditor agency submits a complete debt claim, OPM will collect and pay the debt to the creditor agency as provided in §§ 831.1806 and 831.1807.</P>
              <P>(2) If the suit or the administrative proceeding results in a judgment for the debtor without establishing a debt to the United States, OPM will pay the balance of the refund to the debtor upon receipt of a certified copy of the judgment or administrative decision.</P>

              <P>OPM will enter into an agreement with any State within 120 days of an application for agreement from the proper State official. The terms of the standard agreement will be §§ 831.1903 through 831.1906 of this subpart.

              <P>OPM will, in performance of this agreement:</P>

              <P>(a) Process the magnetic tape containing State tax transactions against the annuity roll once a month at the time monthly recurring payments are prepared for the United States Treasury Department. Errors that are identified will not be processed into the file, and will be identified and returned to the State for resolution via the monthly error report. Collections of State income tax will continue in effect until the State requesting the initial action supplies either a valid revocation or change. The magnetic tape must be received 35 days prior to the <PRTPAGE P="182"/>date of the check in which the transactions are to be effective. For example, withholding transactions for the July 1 check must be received 5 days prior to June 1. If the magnetic tape submitted by the State cannot be read, OPM will notify the State of this fact, and if a satisfactory replacement can be supplied in time for monthly processing, it will be processed.</P>
              <P>(b) Deduct from the regular, recurring annuity payments of an annuitant the amount he or she has so requested to be withheld, provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount of the request is an even dollar amount, not less than Five Dollars nor more than the net recurring amount. The State may set any even dollar amount above Five Dollars as a minimum withholding amount.</P>
              <P>(2) The annuitant has not designated more than one other State for withholding purposes within the calendar year. The State can set any limit on the number of changes an annuitant may make in the amount to be withheld.</P>
              <P>(c) Retain the amounts withheld in the Fund until payment is due.</P>
              <P>(d) Pay the net withholding to the State on the last day of the first month following each calendar quarter.</P>
              <P>(e) Make the following reports:</P>
              <P>(1) A monthly report which will include all the State tax withholdings, cancellations and adjustments for the month, and also each request OPM was not able to process, with an explanation, in coded format, of the reason for rejection.</P>
              <P>(2) A quarterly report which will include State, State address, quarterly withholdings, quarterly cancellations and adjustments, quarterly net withholdings and year-to-date amounts. Where cancelled or adjusted payments were made in a previous year, OPM shall append a listing of the cancelled or adjusted payments which shows the date and amount of each cancelled or adjusted tax withholding, and the name and Social Security identification number of the annuitant from whom it was withheld. If either party terminates the agreement and the amount of cancelled or adjusted deductions exceeds the amount withheld for the final quarter, then the quarterly report shall show the amount to be refunded to OPM and the address to which payment should be made.</P>
              <P>(3) An annual summary report which contains the name, Social Security identification number, and total amount withheld from non-cancelled payments during the previous calendar year, for each annuitant who requested tax withholding payable to the State. In the event the annuitant had State income tax withholding in effect for more than one State in that calendar year, the report will show only the amount withheld for the State receiving the report.</P>
              <P>(4) An annual report to each annuitant for whom State income taxes were withheld giving the amount of withholding paid to the State during the calendar year.</P>

              <P>(a) Accept requests and revocations from annuitants who have designated that State income tax deductions will go to the State.</P>
              <P>(b) Convert these requests on a monthly basis to a machine-readable magnetic tape using specifications received from OPM, and forward that tape to OPM for processing.</P>
              <P>(c) Inform annuitants whose tax requests are rejected by OPM that the request was so rejected and of the reason why it was so rejected.</P>
              <P>(d) Recognize that, to the extent not prohibited by State laws, records maintained by the State relating to this program are considered jointly maintained by OPM and are subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). Accordingly, the States will maintain such records in accordance with that statute and OPM's implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 297.</P>
              <P>(e) Respond to requests of annuitants for information and advice in regard to State income tax withholding.</P>

              <P>(f) Credit the amounts withheld from civil service annuities to the State tax liability of the respective annuitants, and, subject to applicable provisions of State law to the contrary, refund any balance over and above that liability to the annuitant, unless he or she should request otherwise.<PRTPAGE P="183"/>
              </P>

              <P>(a) A request or revocation is effective when processed by OPM. OPM will process each request by the first day of the second month following the month in which it is received, but incurs no liability or indebtedness by its failure to do so.</P>
              <P>(b) Any amount deducted from an annuity payment and paid to the State as a result of a request is deemed properly paid, unless the annuity payment itself is cancelled.</P>
              <P>(c) OPM will provide the State with the information necessary to properly process a request for State income tax withholding.</P>
              <P>(d) If the State is paid withholding which is contrary to the terms of the annuitant's request, the State is liable to the annuitant for the amount improperly withheld, and subject to account verification from OPM, agrees to pay that amount to the annuitant on demand.</P>
              <P>(e) In the case of a disputed amount in any of the reports described and authorized by this agreement, the Associate Director for Compensation of OPM will issue an accounting. If the State finds this accounting unacceptable, it may then and only then pursue such remedies as are otherwise available.</P>
              <P>(f) If a State receives an overpayment of monies properly belonging to the Fund, OPM will offset the overpayment from a future payment due the State. If there are no further payments due the State, OPM will inform the State in writing of the amount due. Within 60 days of the date of receipt of that communication the State will make payment of the amount due.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Effect of part 772 of this chapter on CSRS lump-sum payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An interim appointment under § 772.102 of this chapter does not affect the lump-sum payment of retirement contributions made to a separated employee unless it becomes effective within 31 days of the employee's separation from the service. An interim appointment effective within 31 days of the employee's separation makes the employee ineligible for the lump-sum payment. Payments made in error will be collected under subpart M of part 831 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) When an employee's separation is cancelled after the MSPB initial decision becomes final, when the Board issues a final order cancelling the employee's separation, or when the agency and the employee agree to cancel the separation, the agency must notify OPM and request the amount of the erroneous lump-sum payment.</P>
              <P>(c) At the time the employee's separation is cancelled, the agency must deduct the amount of the lump-sum payment from any back pay to which the employee is entitled as required by 5 CFR 550.805(e).</P>

              <P>(a) To compute the beginning rate of annuity payable to a retiree who elects an alternative form of annuity, OPM will first compute the monthly rate of annuity otherwise payable under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, including all reductions provided under the subchapter other than those in § 8343a. That monthly rate is then reduced by an amount equal to the retiree's lump-sum credit divided by the present value factor for the retiree's attained age (in full years) at the time of retirement. The reduced monthly rate is then rounded to the next lowest dollar and becomes the rate of annuity payable.</P>

              <P>(b) The amount of a deposit or redeposit deemed paid under paragraph (a) of this section will include any interest owed by the employee or Member under 5 U.S.C. 8334.<PRTPAGE P="191"/>

              <P>(2) Supplemental survivor annuity benefits payable under this paragraph, computed in whole or in part under the provisions of § 837.503(b)(1)(i) of this part, using CSRS-Offset service, are subject to reduction under subpart G of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) OPM will reduce a supplemental survivor annuity (an annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8341) based on the service of an individual who performed CSRS-Offset service, if the survivor annuitant is entitled, or on proper application would be entitled, to survivor benefits under section 202(d), (e), or (f) (relating to children's, widows', and widowers' benefits, respectively) of the Social Security Act.</P>

              <P>(2) Is entitled, or on proper application would be entitled, to survivor benefits under the Social Security Act provisions mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, respectively.</P>
              <P>(c) The reduction under paragraphs (a) of this section will be computed and adjusted in a manner consistent with the provisions of § 837.701 (c) through (e) of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) A reduction under paragraph (a) of this section stops on the date entitlement to the disability or survivor benefits under title II of the Social Security Act terminates. In the case of a survivor annuitant who has not made proper application for the social security benefit, the reduction under paragraph (a) of this section stops on the date entitlement to such survivor benefits would otherwise terminate. If a social security benefit is reduced under any provision of the Social Security Act, even if reduced to zero, entitlement to that benefit is not considered to have terminated.</P>
              <P>(e) OPM will accept the determination or certification of the Social Security Administration, submitted in a form prescribed by OPM, concerning entitlement to social security survivor benefits and the beginning and ending dates thereof.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> An annuitant who has performed reemployment service after the commencing date of annuity under the provisions of another retirement system, and who is entitled to an annuity benefit from the other retirement system during a period in which he or she is also entitled to an annuity benefit under CSRS or FERS, may receive both benefits simultaneously, or for the same period, except that the annuitant may not receive both benefits simultaneously, or for the same period, if—</P>

              <P>(2) Entitlement to the annuity from the other retirement system is based on service credited in the computation of the CSRS or FERS annuity, or service credited in the computation of the annuity from the other retirement system was used in the computation of the CSRS or FERS annuity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Election of alternative benefits.</E> (1) Where simultaneous receipt of, or entitlement to, both annuities is barred under the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the annuitant must elect to receive either the annuity under the other retirement system, or the CSRS annuity.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the annuitant, under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, elects to receive annuity from the other retirement system in lieu of the CSRS or FERS annuity, the CSRS or FERS annuity terminates as of the commencing date of the other annuity, and any overpayment of CSRS annuity will be offset from the other annuity and paid to OPM.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Recomputation.</E> Where simultaneous receipt of annuities from more than one retirement system is barred by paragraph (a)(2), but not by paragraph (a)(1), of this section, the CSRS or FERS annuity may be recomputed to exclude credit for service credited in determining entitlement to, or the amount of, the annuity from the other retirement system, effective as of the commencing date of the annuity from the other retirement system for Federal employees, and the recomputed CSRS or FERS annuity may be paid simultaneous with, or for the same period as, the annuity from the other retirement system for Federal employees.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Forfeiture.</E> Where an annuitant's coverage as an employee under another retirement system, whether by election or by operation of law or regulation, results in forfeiture of annuity rights under CSRS or FERS, the CSRS or FERS annuity will terminate as of the effective date of coverage.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Survivors.</E> The rules detailed in this section in regard to dual entitlement to annuity benefits under CSRS or FERS and another retirement system also apply to dual entitlement to survivor benefits under CSRS or FERS and another retirement system, unless <PRTPAGE P="207"/>the particular circumstance is otherwise governed by specific provision of statute or regulation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Cancellation of retirement by judicial or administrative authority.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Cancellation of retirement action.</E> A separation from employment on which an application for retirement is based may only be canceled by the former employing agency in response to a direct and final order of a judicial or administrative body charged with the responsibility of reviewing the legality of the separation, and authorized to make such order, or by agreement between the annuitant and the former employing agency in resolution of a grievance, complaint, dispute, appeal or other action, involving an allegedly erroneous separation, before such authority.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency notification to OPM.</E> Upon receiving a final order requiring cancellation of the annuitant's separation or after the annuitant and the agency agree to cancel the separation, the employing agency must notify OPM and request the amount of the erroneous payment to be recovered under § 550.805(e) of this chapter from any back pay adjustment to which the employee may be entitled.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Collection of erroneously paid retirement benefits.</E> (1) If OPM determines that an overpayment of annuity or lump-sum credit has occurred and the employee is entitled to receive back pay because of the canceled separation, the overpaid retirement benefits must be deducted to the extent they can be recovered from the back pay adjustment as required by § 550,805(e) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) Amounts recovered from back pay will not be subject to waiver consideration under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8346(b) or 8470(b). If there is no back pay or the back pay is insufficient to recover the entire payment, the employee may request that OPM waive the uncollected portion of the overpayment. If waiver is not granted, the employee must repay the erroneous payment.</P>

                <P>(2) In executing court orders under this part, OPM must honor the clear instructions of the court. Instructions must be specific and unambiguous. OPM will not supply missing provisions, interpret ambiguous language, or clarify the court's intent by researching individual State laws. In carrying out the court's instructions, OPM performs purely ministerial actions in accordance with these regulations. Disagreement between the parties concerning the validity or the provisions of any court order must be resolved by the court.</P>

                <P>(3) The procedures that OPM will follow in honoring court orders and in making payments to the former spouse or child abuse creditor; and</P>
                <P>(4) The effect of certain words and phrases commonly used in court orders affecting retirement benefits.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) Subparts A through I of this part apply only to court orders received by OPM on or after January 1, 1993.</P>
                <P>(2) Subpart J of this part applies only to court orders received by OPM before January 1, 1993.</P>
                <P>(3) Subpart K of this part applies only to court orders received by OPM on or after October 14, 1994.</P>
                <P>(d) This part has no application to the Thrift Savings Plan described in subchapter III of chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) To provide sufficient instructions and information for OPM to compute the amount of the former spouse's share of the employee annuity as required by paragraph (a) of this section the court order must state the former spouse's share as—</P>

              <P>(c)(1) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing if OPM would have to examine a State statute or court decision (on a different case) to understand, establish, or evaluate the formula for computing the former spouse's share of the employee annuity.<PRTPAGE P="222"/>

              <SUBJECT>Specifying type of annuity for application of formula, percentage or fraction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A court order directed at an employee annuity that states the former spouse's share of employee annuity as a formula, percentage, or fraction is not a court order acceptable for processing unless OPM can determine the type of annuity (i.e., phased retirement annuity, composite retirement annuity, net annuity, gross annuity, or self-only annuity) on which to apply the formula, percentage, or fraction.</P>
              <P>(b) The standard types of annuity to which OPM can apply the formula, percentage, or fraction are phased retirement annuity of a phased retiree, or net annuity, gross annuity, or self-only annuity of a retiree. Unless the court order otherwise directs, OPM will apply to gross annuity the formula, percentage, or fraction directed at annuity payable to either a retiree or a phased retiree. Section 838.625 contains information on other methods of describing these types of annuity.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) A court order may include provisions directed at:</P>
              <P>(i) Phased retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree, to address the possibility that an employee will enter phased retirement status;</P>
              <P>(ii) Composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree at entry into full retirement status, to address the possibility that an employee will enter phased retirement status and then enter full retirement status; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Annuity payable to an employee who retires without having elected phased retirement status.</P>
              <P>(2) To separately provide for division of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity, a provision of a court order must expressly state that it is directed at “phased retirement annuity” or “composite retirement annuity,” and must meet the requirements of paragraph (a). That is, it must state the type of annuity to be divided (e.g., “net phased retirement annuity”). If such a provision is unclear as to whether it is directed at gross, net, or self-only phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity, the provision will be applied to gross phased retirement annuity or gross composite retirement annuity, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) Unless a court order expressly states that phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity is not to be divided, a court order meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and that generally provides for division of annuity, without meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, regarding the specific type of annuity being divided, will <PRTPAGE P="223"/>be applied to divide any employee annuity, including phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity.</P>

                <P>(a) This subpart regulates the meaning of terms necessary to award benefits in a court order directed at an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions. OPM applies the meanings to determine whether a court order directed at an employee annuity <PRTPAGE P="227"/>or a refund of employee contributions is a court order acceptable for processing and to establish the amount of the former spouse's share of an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) This subpart establishes a uniform meaning to be used for terms and phrases frequently used in awarding a former spouse a portion of an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions.</P>
                <P>(2) This subpart informs the legal community about the definitions to apply terms used in drafting court orders so that the resulting court orders contain the proper language to accomplish the aims of the court.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) To assist attorneys and courts in preparing court orders that OPM can honor in the manner that the court intends, appendix A of this subpart contains model language to accomplish many of the more common objectives associated with the award of a former spouse's share of an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions.</P>
                <P>(2) By using the language in appendix A of this subpart, the court, attorneys, and parties will know that the court order will be acceptable for processing and that OPM will treat the terminology used in the court order in the manner stated in the appendix.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Identifying the retirement system.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) To satisfy the requirements of § 838.303(b)(1) or § 838.502(b)(1), a court order must contain language identifying the retirement system to be affected. For example, “CSRS,” “FERS,” “OPM,” or “Federal Government” benefits, or benefits payable “based on service with the U.S. Department of Agriculture,” etc., are sufficient identification of the retirement system.</P>
                <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, language referring to benefits under another retirement system, such as military retired pay, Foreign Service retirement benefits or Central Intelligence Agency retirement benefits, does not satisfy the requirements of § 838.303(b)(1) or § 838.502(b)(1).</P>
                <P>(1) A court order that mistakenly labels CSRS benefits as FERS benefits and vice versa satisfies the requirements of §§ 838.303(b)(1) and 838.502(b)(1).</P>
                <P>(2) Unless the court order expressly provides otherwise, for employees transferring to FERS, court orders directed at CSRS benefits apply to the entire FERS basic benefit, including the CSRS component, if any. Such a court order satisfies the requirements of §§ 838.303(b)(1) and 838.502(b)(1).</P>
                <P>(c) A court order affecting military retired pay, even when military retired pay has been waived for inclusion in CSRS annuities, does not award a former spouse a portion of an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions under CSRS or FERS. Such a court order does not satisfy the requirements of § 838.303(b)(1) or § 838.502(b)(1).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Distinguishing between annuities and contributions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A court order that uses terms such as “annuities,” “pensions,” “retirement benefits,” or similar terms, without distinguishing between phased retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree, or composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree upon entry into full retirement status, and employee annuity payable to a retiree, satisfies the requirements of §§ 838.303(b)(2) and 838.502(b)(2) for purposes of dividing any employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) A court order using “contributions,” “deductions,” “deposits,” “retirement accounts,” “retirement fund,” or similar terms satisfies the requirements of § 838.502(b)(2) and may be used only to divide the amount of contributions that the employee has paid into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.</P>

                <P>(2) Unless the court order specifically states otherwise, when an employee annuity is payable, a court order using the terms specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section satisfies the requirements of § 838.303(b)(2) and awards the former spouse a benefit to be paid in equal monthly installments at 50 percent of the gross annuity beginning on the date the employee annuity commences or the date of the court order, <PRTPAGE P="228"/>whichever comes later, until the specific dollar amount is reached.</P>

                <P>(b)(1) Unless the court order directly and unequivocally orders otherwise, a court order that awards a former spouse a portion of an employee annuity either on a percentage basis or by use of a fraction or formula provides that the former spouse's share of the employee annuity will be adjusted to maintain the same percentage or fraction whenever the employee annuity changes as a result of—</P>
                <P>(i) Salary adjustments occurring after the date of the decree and before the employee retires; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Cost-of-living adjustments occurring after the date of the decree and after the date of the employee's retirement.</P>
                <P>(2) A court order that awards a former spouse a specific dollar amount from the employee annuity prevents the former spouse from benefiting from salary and cost-of-living adjustments after the date of the decree, unless the court expressly orders their inclusion.</P>
                <P>(c)(1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a court order that contains a general instruction to calculate the former spouse's share effective at the time of divorce or separation entitles the former spouse to the benefit of salary adjustments occurring after the specified date to the same extent as the employee.</P>

                <P>(ii) To prevent the application of salary adjustments after the date of the divorce or separation, the court order must either state the exact dollar amount of the award to the former spouse or specifically instruct OPM not to apply salary adjustments after the <PRTPAGE P="229"/>specified date in computing the former spouse's share of the employee annuity.</P>
                <P>(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a court order that requires OPM to compute a benefit as of a specified date before the employee's phased retirement or retirement, and specifically instructs OPM not to apply salary adjustments after the specified date in computing the former spouse's share of an employee annuity, provides that the former spouse is entitled to the application of cost-of-living adjustments after the date the individual enters phased retirement status or retires (if the employee does not enter phased retirement status first), in the manner described in § 838.241.</P>
                <P>(ii) To award cost-of-living adjustments between a specified date and the employee's phased retirement or retirement, the court order must specifically instruct OPM to adjust the former spouse's share of the employee annuity by any cost-of-living adjustments occurring between the specified date and the date the employee enters phased retirement status or retires (if the employee does not enter phased retirement status first).</P>

                <P>(b) Unless the court order otherwise expressly directs—</P>
                <P>(1) For the purpose of describing a period of time to be excluded from any element of a computation, the term “military service” means military service as defined in section 8331(13) of title 5, United States Code, and does not include civilian service with the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard; and</P>
                <P>(2) For the purpose of describing a period of time to be included in any element of a computation, the term “military service” means all periods of military and civilian service performed with the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) When a court order directed at employee annuity (other than a phased retirement annuity or a composite retirement annuity) contains a formula for dividing employee annuity that requires a computation of service worked as of a date prior to separation and using terms such as “years of service,” “total service,” “service performed,” or similar terms, the time attributable to unused sick leave will not be included.</P>
                <P>(2) When a court order directed at employee annuity other than a phased retirement annuity or a composite retirement annuity contains a formula for dividing employee annuity that requires a computation of “creditable service” (or some other phrase using “credit” or its equivalent) as of a date prior to retirement, unused sick leave will be included in the computation as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) If the amount of unused sick leave is specified, the court order awards a portion of the employee annuity equal to the monthly employee annuity at retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of “creditable service” as of the date specified plus the number of months of unused sick leave specified (which sum is rounded to eliminate partial months) and whose denominator is the months of “creditable service” used in the retirement computation.</P>

                <P>(ii) If the amount of unused sick leave is not specified, the court order awards a portion of the employee annuity equal to the monthly rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of “creditable service” as of the date specified (no sick leave included) and whose denominator is the number of months of “creditable service” used in the retirement computation (sick leave included).<PRTPAGE P="230"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d)(1) General language such as “benefits earned as an employee with the U.S. Postal Service * * *” provides only that CSRS or FERS retirement benefits are subject to division and does not limit the period of service included in the computation (i.e., service performed with other Government agencies will be included).</P>
                <P>(2) To limit the computation of benefits other than a phased retirement annuity or a composite retirement annuity to a particular period of employment, the court order must—</P>
                <P>(i) Use language expressly limiting the period of service to be included in the computation (e.g., “only U.S. Postal Service” or “exclusive of any service other than U.S. Postal Service employment”); or</P>
                <P>(ii) Specify the number of months to be included in the computation; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Describe specifically the period of service to be included in the computation (e.g., “only service performed during the period Petitioner and Defendant were married” or “benefits based on service performed through the date of divorce”).</P>
                <P>(e) A court order directed at a phased retirement annuity or a composite retirement annuity cannot limit the computation and division of a phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity to a particular period of employment or service. A phased retirement annuity is based on an employee's service as of phased retirement and a “fully retired phased component,” described in §§ 831.1742 and 848.502, of a composite retirement annuity is based on a phased retiree's service as of his or her full retirement. A court order that attempts to limit the computation of a phased retirement annuity or a composite retirement annuity to a particular period of employment or service is not a court order acceptable for processing. If the former spouse's award of a portion of phased retirement annuity or a composite retirement annuity is to be limited, the limitation of the division must be accomplished in a manner other than by limiting the service to be used in the computation.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Subpart F of Part 838—Recommended Language for Court Orders Dividing Employee Annuities</HD>
              <P>This appendix provides recommended language for use in court orders attempting to divide employee annuity. A court order directed at employee annuity should include five elements:</P>
              <P>• Identification of the benefits;</P>
              <P>• Instructions that OPM pay the former spouse;</P>
              <P>• A method for computing the amount of the former spouse's benefit;</P>
              <P>• Identification of the type of annuity to which to apply a fraction, percentage or formula; and</P>
              <P>• Instructions on what OPM should do if the employee leaves Federal service before retirement and applies for a refund of employee contributions.</P>

              <P>The court order may also include instructions for disposition of the former spouse's share if the former spouse dies before the employee. By using the model language, <PRTPAGE P="231"/>courts will know that the court order will have the effect described in this appendix.</P>
              <P>The model language in this appendix does not award a benefit that is payable after the death of the employee. A separate, distinct award of a former spouse survivor annuity is necessary to award a former spouse a benefit that is payable after the death of the employee. Appendix A to subpart I of this part contains model language for awarding survivor annuities and contains some examples that award both a portion of an employee annuity and a survivor annuity.</P>
              <P>The model language uses the terms “[former spouse]” to identify the spouse who is receiving a former spouse's portion of an employee annuity and “[employee]” to identify the Federal employee whose employment was covered by the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System. Obviously, in drafting an actual court order the appropriate terms, such as “Petitioner” and “Respondent,” or the names of the parties should replace “[former spouse]” and “[employee].”</P>
              <P>Similarly, the models are drafted for employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement System. The name of the retirement system should be changed for employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System.</P>

              </FP>
              <P>A court order may include an award directed at (1) phased retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree, to address the possibility that an employee will enter phased retirement status; (2) composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree at entry into full retirement status, to address the possibility that an employee will enter phased retirement status and then enter full retirement status; or (3) annuity payable to an employee who retires without having elected phased retirement status.</P>

              <P>A general non-specific award will apply to any employee annuity payable, including phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity (<E T="03">see</E> ¶¶ 201-211). For example, an award dividing employee annuity that uses terms such as “annuities,” “pensions,” “retirement benefits,” or similar general terms, would apply to all types of employee annuity.</P>
              <P>To separately provide for division of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity, a provision of a court order must expressly state that it is directed at “phased retirement annuity” or “composite retirement annuity,” and must indicate the share of employee annuity as a formula, percentage, or fraction. That is, it must state the type of annuity to be divided (e.g., “net phased retirement annuity”). If such a provision is unclear as to whether it is directed at gross, net, or self-only phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity, the provision will be applied to gross phased retirement annuity or gross composite retirement annuity.</P>
              <P>It should be noted that a former spouse survivor annuity cannot be awarded from a phased retirement annuity; therefore, a phased retirement annuity is not subject to reduction to provide a former spouse survivor annuity. As a consequence, an award dividing either “self-only phased retirement annuity” or a “gross phased retirement annuity” would be directed at identical annuities. However, a former spouse survivor annuity can be awarded from a composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree at entry into full retirement status (i.e., when the “phased retiree” enters full retirement status and becomes a “retiree”); therefore, there would be a difference between an award of a share of “self-only composite retirement annuity” and an award of a share of “gross composite retirement annuity.”</P>

              <P>Due to the complexity of the benefits, care should be taken in drafting separate awards of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity. It should also be noted, for example, that an award directed only at the division of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree will not be effective to divide annuity payable to an employee who retires in the usual manner, without having entered phased retirement status first. If separate awards of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity are to be provided, consideration should be given to including provisions in the paragraph addressing the possibility that the employee may retire in the usual manner without entering phased <PRTPAGE P="234"/>retirement status before fully retiring. Similarly, if employee annuity is only to be awarded in the event the employee retires in the usual manner, without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring, consideration should be given to including specific language to that effect.

              <P>(2) When a court order is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section to state that the provisions of a court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are <PRTPAGE P="242"/>governed by this part the court order must—</P>

                <P>(a) To satisfy the requirements of § 838.804(b)(1), a court order must contain language identifying the retirement system affected.

                <SUBJECT>Specifying an award of a former spouse survivor annuity.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) To satisfy the requirements of § 838.804(b)(2), a court order must specify that it is awarding a former spouse survivor annuity. The court order must contain language such as “survivor annuity,” “death benefits,” “former spouse survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8341(h)(1),” etc.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) A court order that provides that the former spouse is to “continue as” or “be named as” the beneficiary of CSRS survivor benefits or similar language satisfies the requirements of § 838.804(b)(2).</P>
                <P>(2) A court order that requires an employee or retiree to maintain survivor benefits covering the former spouse satisfies the requirements of § 838.804(b)(2), if the former spouse was covered by a CSRS or FERS survivor annuity or the FERS basic employee death benefit as defined in § 843.102 of this chapter at the time of the divorce.</P>
                <P>(c) Two types of potential survivor annuities may be provided by retiring employees to cover former spouses. Under CSRS, section 8341(h) of title 5, United States Code, provides for “former spouse survivor annuities” and section 8339(k) of title 5, United States Code, provides for “insurable interest annuities.” These are distinct benefits, each with its own advantages. The corresponding FERS provisions are sections 8445 and 8444, respectively.</P>
                <P>(1) OPM will enforce court orders to provide section 8341(h) or section 8445 annuities. These annuities are less expensive and have fewer restrictions than insurable interest annuities but the former spouse's interest will automatically terminate upon remarriage before age 55. To provide a section 8341(h) or section 8445 annuity, the court order must use terms such as “former spouse survivor annuity,” “section 8341(h) annuity,” or “survivor annuity.”</P>
                <P>(2) OPM cannot enforce court orders to provide “insurable interest annuities” under section 8339(k) or section 8444. These annuities may only be elected at the time of retirement by a retiring employee who is not retiring under the disability provision of the law and who is in good health. The retirees may also elect to cancel the insurable interest annuity to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse acquired after retirement. The parties might seek to provide this type of annuity interest if the nonemployee spouse expects to remarry before age 55, if the employee expects to remarry a younger second spouse before retirement or if another former spouse has already been awarded a section 8341(h) annuity. However, the court will have to provide its own remedy if the employee is not eligible for or does not make the election. OPM cannot enforce the court order. Language including the words “insurable interest” or referring to section 8339(k) or section 8444 does not satisfy the requirements of § 838.804(b)(2).</P>
                <P>(3) In court orders which contain internal contradictions about the type of annuity, such as “insurable interest annuity under section 8341(h),” the section reference will control.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Determining the amount of a former spouse survivor annuity.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A court order that contains no provision stating the amount of the former spouse survivor annuity provides the maximum former spouse survivor annuity permitted under § 831.641 or § 842.613 of this chapter and satisfies the requirements of § 838.805.</P>

                <P>(b)(1) A court order that provides that “a former spouse will keep” or “an employee or retiree will maintain” the survivor annuity to which he or she was entitled at the time of the divorce satisfies the requirements of § 838.805 and provides a former spouse survivor annuity in the same proportion to the maximum survivor annuity under <PRTPAGE P="246"/>§ 831.641 or § 842.613 of this chapter as the former spouse had at the time of divorce. For example, a former spouse of an employee would be entitled to a maximum survivor benefit; a former spouse of a retiree (who was married to the retiree at retirement and continuously until the divorce resulting in the court order) would be entitled to the survivor benefit elected at retirement.</P>
                <P>(2) If, at the time of divorce, the employee covered by FERS had at least 18 months of civilian service creditable under FERS but less than 10 years of service creditable under FERS, a former spouse with a court order described in paragraph (b)(1) or paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be entitled to the basic employee death benefit as defined in § 843.102 of this chapter, but is not entitled to any other former spouse survivor annuity based on the court order.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) A court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity of less than $12 per year satisfies the requirements of § 838.805 and provides an initial rate of $1 per month plus all cost-of-living increases occurring after the later of—</P>
                <P>(i) The date of the court order; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The date when the employee retires.</P>
                <P>(2) The reduction in the employee annuity will be computed as though the court order provided a former spouse survivor annuity of $1 per month.</P>
                <P>(d)(1) A court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity while authorizing the employee or retiree to elect a lesser former spouse survivor annuity upon the employee's or retiree's remarriage satisfies the requirements of § 838.805, and provides the former spouse survivor annuity at the rate initially provided in the court order but does not allow the employee or retiree to elect a lesser benefit for the former spouse.</P>
                <P>(2) To provide full survivor annuity benefits to a former spouse while authorizing the employee or retiree to elect a lesser former spouse survivor annuity benefit in order to provide survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse, the court order must provide for a reduction in the former spouse survivor annuity upon the employee's or retiree's election of survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse.</P>
                <P>(3) A reduction in the amount of survivor benefits provided to the former spouse does not satisfy the requirements of § 838.805 if it is contingent upon the employee's or annuitant's remarriage rather than his or her election of survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Subpart I of Part 838—Recommended Language for Court Orders Awarding Former Spouse Survivor Annuities</HD>

              <P>This appendix provides recommended language for use in court orders awarding former spouse survivor annuities. A former spouse survivor annuity is not a continuation of a former spouse's share of an employee annuity after the death of the employee. A former spouse's entitlement to a portion of an employee annuity cannot continue after the death of the employee. A <PRTPAGE P="248"/>court order that attempts to extend the former spouse's entitlement to a portion of an employee annuity past the death of the employee is not effective. The model language in this appendix does not award benefits payable to the former spouse during the lifetime of the employee. A separate, distinct award of a portion of the employee annuity is necessary to award a former spouse a benefit during the lifetime of the employee. Appendix A to subpart F of this part contains model language for a portion of an employee annuity.</P>
              <P>Attorneys should exercise great care in preparing provisions concerning former spouse survivor annuities because sections 8341(h)(4) and 8445(d) of title 5, United States Code, prohibit OPM from accepting modifications after the retirement or death of the employee. (See § 838.806 concerning unacceptable modifications.) A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity should include four elements:</P>
              <P>• Identification of the retirement system;</P>
              <P>• Explicit award of the former spouse survivor annuity.</P>
              <P>• Method for computing the amount of the former spouse's benefit; and</P>
              <P>• Instructions on what OPM should do if the employee leaves Federal service before retirement and applies for a refund of employee contributions.</P>
              <P>By using the model language, courts will know that the court order will have the effect described in this appendix.</P>
              <P>The model language uses the terms “[former spouse]” to identify the spouse who is receiving a former spouse survivor annuity and “[employee]” to identify the Federal employee whose employment was covered by the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System. Obviously, in drafting an actual court order the appropriate terms, such as “Petitioner” and “Respondent,” or the names of the parties should replace “[former spouse]” and “[employee].”</P>

              <P>Similarly, except when the provision applies only to the basic employee death benefit (defined in § 843.103 of this chapter) that is available only under the Federal Employees Retirement System, the models are drafted for employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (5 U.S.C. 8331 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). The name of the retirement system should be changed for employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (5 U.S.C. chapter 84.).</P>
              <P>Statutory references used in the models are to CSRS provisions (such as section 8341(h) of title 5, United States Code). When appropriate, the corresponding FERS provision (such as section 8445 of title 5, United States Code) should be used.</P>

              <P>Paragraphs 701 through 704 contain model language for awards of former spouse survivor annuities in amounts that do not require specification of the base on which the former spouse's share will be computed. Situations in which the computational base need not be specified include amounts defined by law or regulation. For example, the maximum former spouse survivor annuity is fixed by statute generally at 55 percent of the employee annuity under CSRS and 50 percent of the employee annuity under FERS.</P>

              <P>Paragraphs 711 and 712 contain model language for awards of former spouse survivor annuities that use the employee annuity as the base on which the portion awarded will be computed (that is, on which percentage, fraction or formula will be applied). Paragraphs 721 and 722 contain model language for awards of former spouse survivor annuities that use the maximum possible survivor annuity as the base on which the portion <PRTPAGE P="249"/>awarded will be computed (that is, on which percentage, fraction or formula will be applied). Using the maximum possible survivor annuity as the base will generally award 55 percent under CSRS and 50 percent under FERS of the amount that using the employee annuity as the base would produce.</P>
              <P>Paragraphs 750 and higher contain model language to implement the most common other types of awards.</P>

              <P>Each model paragraph includes a reference to the statutory provision under CSRS that authorizes OPM to honor court orders awarding former spouse survivor annuities. The FERS statutory provision that corresponds to section 8341(h) (mentioned in the first sentence of each example) is section 8445.

              <P>(a) A former spouse is entitled to a portion of an employee's retirement benefits only to the extent that the division of retirement benefits is expressly provided for by the court order. The court order must divide employee retirement benefits, award a payment from employee retirement benefits, or award a former spouse annuity.</P>
              <P>(b) The court order must state the former spouse's share as a fixed amount, a percentage or a fraction of the annuity, or by a formula that does not contain any variables whose value is not readily ascertainable from the face of the order or normal OPM files.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) For purposes of payments from employee retirement benefits, OPM will review court orders as a whole to <PRTPAGE P="253"/>determine whether the language of the order shows an intent by the court that the former spouse should receive a portion of the employee's retirement benefits directly from the United States.</P>
              <P>(i) Orders that direct or imply that OPM is to make payment of a portion of employee retirement benefits, or are neutral about the source of payment, will be honored unless the retiree can demonstrate that the order is invalid in accordance with § 838.1009.</P>
              <P>(ii) Orders that specifically direct the retiree to pay a portion of employee retirement benefits to a former spouse (and do not contain language to show the court intends payment from the Civil Service Retirement System) will be honored unless the retiree objects to direct payment by OPM within the 30-day notice period prescribed in § 838.1008, but will not be honored even if the retiree raises only a general objection to payment by OPM within that 30-day notice period.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of awarding a former spouse annuity, the court order must either state the former spouse's entitlement to a survivor annuity or direct an employee, Member, or retiree to provide a former spouse annuity.</P>
              <P>(d) For purposes of affecting or awarding a former spouse annuity, a court order is not a qualifying court order whenever—</P>
              <P>(1) The marriage was terminated before May 7, 1985; or</P>
              <P>(2)(i) The marriage was terminated on or after May 7, 1985; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The employee or Member retired under CSRS before May 7, 1985; and</P>
              <P>(iii)(A) The employee or Member had elected not to provide a current spouse annuity for that spouse at the time of retirement; or,</P>
              <P>(B) In the case of a post-retirement marriage, the annuitant had not elected to provide a survivor annuity for that spouse before May 7, 1985.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) For purposes of awarding, increasing, reducing, or eliminating a former spouse survivor annuity, or explaining, interpreting, or clarifying a court order that awards, increases, reduces or eliminates a former spouse annuity, the court order must be—</P>
              <P>(i) Issued on a day prior to the date of retirement or date of death of the employee; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse.</P>
              <P>(2) In paragraph (e)(1) of this section, “date of retirement” means the later of—</P>
              <P>(i) The date that the employee files an application for retirement; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The effective commencing date for the employee's annuity.</P>
              <P>(3) In paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) of this section “issued” means actually filed with the clerk of the court, and does not mean the effective date of a retroactive court order that is effective prior to the date when actually filed with the clerk of the court (e.g., a court order issued nunc pro tunc).</P>
              <P>(4)(i) In paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the “first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse” means—</P>
              <P>(A) The original written order that first ends (or first documents an oral order ending) the marriage if the court divides any marital property (or approves a property settlement agreement that divides any marital property) in that order, or in any order issued before that order; or</P>
              <P>(B) The original written order issued after the marriage has been terminated in which the court first divides any marital property (or first approves a property settlement agreement that divides any marital property) if no marital property has been divided prior to the issuance of that order.</P>
              <P>(ii) The first order dividing marital property does not include—</P>
              <P>(A) Any court order that amends, explains, clarifies, or interprets the original written order regardless of the effective date of the court order making the amendment, explanation, clarification, or interpretation; or</P>
              <P>(B) Any court order issued under reserved jurisdiction or any other court orders issued subsequent to the original written order that divide any marital property regardless of the effective date of the court order.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Guidelines for Interpreting State Court Orders Dividing Civil Service Retirement Benefits</HD>
              <P>These guidelines explain the interpretation that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will place on terms and phrases frequently used in dividing benefits. These guidelines are intended not only for the use of OPM, but also for the legal community as a whole, with the hope that by informing attorneys, in advance, about the manner in which OPM will interpret terms written into court orders, the resulting orders will be more carefully drafted, using the proper language to accomplish the aims of the court.</P>

              <P>A substantial number of State court orders are drafted under the mistaken belief that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) (29 U.S.C. 1001 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) applies to CSRS benefits. Sections 1003(b)(1) and 1051 of title 29, United States Code, exempt CSRS from ERISA, because CSRS is a “governmental plan” as defined in section 1001(23) of <PRTPAGE P="259"/>title 29, United States Code. Accordingly, OPM does not honor ERISA Qualifying Domestic Relations Orders (QDRO's) except to the extent that the law governing CSRS expressly authorizes compliance with State court orders. OPM will honor the orders to the extent permitted by CSRS. However, many provisions of ERISA QDRO's are not authorized under CSRS. Most significantly, a court cannot require that payments to the former spouse begin before the employee actually retires (i.e., begins to receive benefits) and, unless the order expressly provides that the former spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity, the payments to the former spouse cannot continue after the employee dies.</P>

Orders that award adjustments to a former spouse stated in terms such as “salary adjustments” or “pay adjustments” occurring after the date of the decree will be interpreted to award increases equal to the adjustments described in or effected under section 5303 of title 5, United States Code until the date of retirement.</P>
              <P>3. Unless otherwise specified in the order, adjustments described in section 8340 of title 5, United States Code will be applied after the date of retirement.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">B. Application of COLAs.</E> 1. Unless the court directly and unequivocally orders otherwise, decrees that divide annuities either on a percentage basis or by use of a formula will be interpreted to entitle the former spouse to salary adjustments occurring after the date of the decree and cost-of-living adjustments occurring after the date of the decree or occurring after the date of the employee's retirement, whichever comes later.</P>
              <P>2. On the other hand, decrees that award a former spouse a specific dollar amount from the annuity will be interpreted as excluding salary and cost-of-living adjustments after the date of the decree, unless the court expressly orders their inclusion.</P>
              <P>3. Orders that contain a general instruction to calculate the former spouse's share effective at the time of divorce or separation will not be interpreted to prevent the inclusion of salary adjustments occurring after the specified date. To prevent the application of salary adjustments after the date of the divorce or separation, the decree must either state the exact dollar amount of the award to the former spouse or specifically state that salary adjustments after the specified date are to be disregarded in computing the former spouse's share.</P>

              <P>4. Orders that require OPM to compute a benefit as of a specified date, and specifically state that salary adjustments after the specified date are to be disregarded in computing the former spouse's share will not be interpreted to prevent the application of COLAs <E T="03">after</E> the date of the Federal employee's retirement. To award COLAs between the specified date and the Federal employee's retirement, the order must specifically state that the former spouse will receive the benefit of any COLAs occurring between the specified date and the date of the Federal employee's retirement. To prevent the application of COLAs after the retirement date, the decree must either state the exact dollar amount of the award to the former spouse or specifically state that the former spouse will not receive the benefit of COLAs occurring after the date of the Federal employee's retirement.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">C. Present value.</E> 1. Orders that award a portion of the “present value” of an annuity will not be honored unless the amount of the “present value” is stated in the order. (See 5 CFR 838.1004(b).)</P>
              <P>2. Orders that award a portion of the “present value” of an annuity stated in the order will be interpreted as awarding “a specific dollar amount.” Unless the court specifically states otherwise, such an award payable from a monthly annuity benefit will be paid in equal installments at 50 percent of the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement or the date of the order, whichever comes later, until the specific dollar amount is reached.</P>
              <P>3. Orders that award a portion of the “value” of an annuity as of a specific date before retirement, without specifying what “value” is, will be interpreted as awarding a portion of the annuity equal to the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of “creditable service” or service worked as of the date specified and the denominator of which is the total number of months as of the time of retirement of “creditable service” or service worked, whichever term is used in the court order. (See III. C. of these Guidelines.)</P>

              <P>4. Orders that contain general language awarding a specified portion of a Federal employee's “retirement benefits” as of a specified date before retirement, but do not specify whether OPM should use “creditable service” or “service worked” as of the date specified to complete the computation, will be interpreted to award a portion of the annuity equal to the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of service worked as of the date specified and the denominator of which is the number of <PRTPAGE P="260"/>months of “creditable service” as of the time of retirement.</P>

                <E T="03">D. Annuity as of a date before retirement.</E> Orders that award a portion of an employee's annuity as of a specified date <E T="03">before</E> the employee's retirement will be interpreted as awarding a portion of the annuity equal to the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of “creditable service” or service worked as of the date specified and the denominator of which is the number of months of “creditable service” or service worked used in the retirement computation.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">E. Formulas or percentage instructions.</E> Orders that contain both a formula or percentage instruction and a dollar amount will be interpreted as including the dollar amount only as the court's estimate of the initial amount of payment. The formula or percentage instruction will control.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">F. Computation limited to a particular period of employment.</E> In order to limit the computation of benefits to a particular period of employment, the court order must use language expressly limiting the period of service to be included in the computation. General language such as “benefits accrued as a result of employment with the U.S. Postal Service * * *” will be interpreted to mean only that CSRS retirement benefits are subject to division (see V.A. of appendix A to subpart J of part 838). Such language will not be interpreted to limit the period of service included in the computation (i.e., service performed with other Government agencies will be included). To limit the period of service, the court order should specify the number of months to be included in the computation or should describe specifically the period of service to be included in the computation (e.g., “only U.S. Postal Service” or “exclusive of any service other than U.S. Postal Service employment” or “only service performed during the period Petitioner and Defendant were married” or “benefits based on service performed through the date of divorce,” etc.).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">G. Amounts less than $12 per year.</E> Orders awarding a former spouse less than $12 per year are qualifying court orders. Such orders will be interpreted as an award of $1 per month.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Types of annuity</HD>
              <P>A. Gross annuity will be interpreted as the amount of the annuity payable after any applicable survivor reduction but before any other deduction.</P>
              <P>B. 1. To divide an annuity before any applicable survivor reduction, the decree must contain language to the effect that the division is to be made on the self-only annuity, the life-rate annuity, or the annuity unreduced for survivor benefit, or equivalent language. A division of “gross annuity” will not accomplish this purpose.</P>
              <P>2. To divide an annuity before the social security offset under section 8349 of title 5, United States Code, the order must expressly state that the division is to occur before the social security offset. The term “unreduced annuity” will mean annuity after the social security offset.</P>
              <P>C. Net annuity or disposable annuity will be interpreted to mean net annuity as defined in § 838.1003.</P>
              <P>D. Orders that fail to state the type of annuity that they are dividing will be interpreted as dividing gross annuity (defined above).</P>
              <P>E. Orders dividing a “retirement check” will be interpreted as dividing net annuity (as defined in § 838.1003).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Calculating time</HD>
              <P>A. The smallest unit of time that will be used in computing a formula in a decree is a month.</P>
              <P>1. This policy is based on section 8332 of title 5, United States Code, that allows credit for service for years or twelfth parts thereof. Requests to calculate smaller units of time will not be honored.</P>

              <P>2. Time calculations by the Office of Personnel Management will be no more precise than years and twelfth parts, even where the court order directs OPM to make a more precise calculation. However, if the court order states a formula using a specified simple or decimal fraction other than twelfth parts, OPM will use the specified number to perform simple mathematical computations. For example, the share of a former spouse awarded a portion of the annuity equal to <FR>1/2</FR> of the fraction whose numerator is 12.863 years and whose denominator is the total service on which the annuity is based would be computed by taking <FR>1/2</FR> of the quotient obtained by dividing 12.863 by the total service measured <E T="03">in years and twelfth parts.</E>
              </P>
              <P>B. The term “military service” will generally be interpreted to include only periods of service within the definition of military service contained in section 8331(13) of title 5, United States Code, i.e., active duty military service. Civilian service with military organizations will not be included as “military service,” except where the exclusion of such civilian service would be manifestly contrary to the intent of the court order.</P>
              <P>C. 1. Unused sick leave is counted as “creditable service” on the date of separation for immediate retirement; it is not apportioned over the time when earned.</P>

              <P>2. When an order contains a formula for dividing annuity that requires a computation of service worked as of a date prior to separation and using terms such as “years of service,” “total service,” or similar terms, the time attributable to unused sick leave will not be included.<PRTPAGE P="261"/>
              </P>
              <P>3. When an order contains a formula for dividing annuity that requires a computation of “creditable service” (or some other phrase using “credit” or its equivalent) as of a date prior to retirement, unused sick leave will be included in the computation as follows—</P>
              <P>(i) If the amount of unused sick leave is specified, the order will be interpreted to award a portion of the annuity equal to the monthly annuity at retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of “creditable service” as of the date specified plus the number of months of unused sick leave specified and whose denominator is the months of “creditable service” used in the retirement computation.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the amount of unused sick leave is not specified, the order will be interpreted to award a portion of the annuity equal to the monthly rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of “creditable service” as of the date specified (no sick leave included) and whose denominator is the number of months of “creditable service” used in the retirement computation.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Distinguishing Between Divisions of Annuity and Refunds of Contributions</HD>
              <P>A. Orders that are unclear about whether they are dividing an annuity or a refund of contributions will be interpreted as dividing an annuity.</P>
              <P>B. Orders using “annuities,” “pensions,” “retirement benefits,” or similar terms will be interpreted as dividing an annuity and whatever other employee benefits become payable, such as refunds. Orders using “contributions,” “deductions,” “deposits,” “retirement accounts,” “retirement fund,” or similar terms will be interpreted as dividing the amount of contributions the employee has paid into the Civil Service Retirement Fund. Unless the court order specifically states otherwise, when an annuity is payable, such orders will be paid in equal monthly installments at 50 percent of the monthly annuity at the time of retirement or the date of the order, whichever comes later, until the specific dollar amount is reached.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Identifying Benefits Affected</HD>
              <P>A. Orders that do not specify what pension or retirement benefits are to be divided will not be interpreted as dividing CSRS benefits. Terms such as “CSRS,” “United States,” “OPM,” “Federal Government” benefits, “Postal Service retirement benefits,” “retirement benefits payable based on service with the U.S. Department of Agriculture,” or similar terms will be considered sufficient to identify civil service retirement benefits for division.</P>
              <P>B. Except as provided below, orders directed at other retirement systems will not be interpreted as affecting CSRS benefits.</P>

              <P>1. Orders that mistakenly label CSRS benefits as Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) benefits, will be interpreted as dividing CSRS benefits and <E T="03">vice versa.</E>
              </P>
              <P>2. Unless the order expressly provides otherwise, for employees transferring to FERS, orders directed at CSRS benefits will be interpreted as applying to the entire FERS basic benefit, including the CSRS component, if any.</P>
              <P>C. Orders directed at other Federal retirement systems such as military retired pay, Foreign Service retirement benefits and Central Intelligence Agency retirement benefits will not be interpreted as dividing CSRS benefits.</P>
              <P>D. Orders dividing military retired pay, even when military retired pay has been waived for inclusion in CSRS annuities, will not be interpreted as dividing CSRS benefits. (Such orders cannot be qualifying orders under section 838.1004(b), because the amount cannot be computed from the face of the order or from normal OPM files.)</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. State Law not Specified in Court Orders</HD>
              <P>A. 1. Except as provided in Guideline VI.A.2., OPM will not research, interpret, or apply State law regarding community or marital property rights or divisions.</P>
              <P>2. OPM will not divide disability retirement benefits when such a division would be contrary to State law unless the order expressly directs division of “disability” benefits.</P>
              <P>B. Orders that do not specify the “community property” fraction or percentage of the former spouse's share will not be considered qualifying because the amount of the benefit cannot be computed from the face of the order or from normal OPM files (5 CFR 838.1004(b)).</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Subpart J of Part 838—Guidelines for Interpreting State Court Orders Awarding Survivor Annuity Benefits to Former Spouses</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">United States of America</HD>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Guidelines for Interpreting State Court Orders Awarding Survivor Annuity Benefits to Former Spouses</HD>

              <P>These guidelines explain the interpretation that the Office of Personnel Management <PRTPAGE P="262"/>(OPM) will place on terms and phrases frequently used in awarding survivor benefits. These guidelines are intended not only for the use of OPM, but also for the legal community as a whole, with the hope that by informing attorneys, in advance, about the manner in which OPM will interpret terms written into court orders, the resulting orders will be more carefully drafted, using the proper language to accomplish the aims of the court.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Insurable Interest Annuities</HD>
              <P>Two types of potential survivor annuities may be provided by retiring employees to cover former spouses. Section 8341(h) of title 5, United States Code, provides for “former spouse annuities.” Section 8339(k) of title 5, United States Code, provides for “insurable interest annuities.” These are distinct benefits, each with its own advantages.</P>
              <P>A. OPM will enforce State court orders to provide section 8341(h) annuities. These annuities are less expensive and have fewer restrictions than insurable interest annuities but the former spouse's interest will automatically terminate upon remarriage before age 55. To provide a section 8341(h) annuity, the order must use terms such as “former spouse annuity,” “section 8341(h) annuity,” or “survivor annuity.”</P>
              <P>B. OPM will not enforce State court orders to provide “insurable interest annuities” under section 8339(k). These annuities may only be elected at the time of retirement by a retiring employee who is not retiring under the disability provision of the law and who is in good health. The retiree may also elect to cancel the insurable interest annuity to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse acquired after retirement. The parties might seek to provide this type of annuity interest if the non-employee spouse expects to remarry before age 55, if the employee expects to remarry a younger second spouse before retirement, or if another former spouse has already been awarded a section 8341(h) annuity. However, the State court will have to provide its own remedy if the employee is not eligible for or does not make the election. OPM will not enforce the order. Language including the words “insurable interest” or referring to section 8339(k) will be interpreted as providing for this type of survivor benefit.</P>
              <P>C. In orders which contain internal contradictions about the type of annuity, such as “insurable interest annuity under section 8341(h),” the section reference will control.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Orders Directed at Other Retirement Systems</HD>
              <P>A. Except as provided in paragraphs A1 and A2, orders directed at other retirement systems will not be interpreted as affecting Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) benefits.</P>

              <P>1. Orders that mistakenly label CSRS benefits as Federal Employee's Retirement System (FERS) benefits, will be interpreted as affecting CSRS benefits and <E T="03">vice versa.</E>
              </P>
              <P>2. Unless the order expressly provides otherwise, for employees transferring to FERS, orders directed at CSRS benefits will be interpreted as applying to the entire FERS basic benefit, including the CSRS component, if any.</P>
              <P>B. Orders directed at other Federal retirement systems such as military retired pay, Foreign Service retirement benefits and Central Intelligence Agency retirement benefits will not be interpreted as awarding a former spouse annuity under CSRS. Thus, orders should contain language identifying the retirement system from which survivor benefits are being awarded. For example, orders should contain terms such as “CSRS,” “OPM,” “Federal Government employee survivor benefits,” or “survivor benefits payable based on service with the U. S. Department of Agriculture,” etc.</P>
              <P>C. Orders affecting military retired pay, even when military retired pay has been waived for inclusion in CSRS annuities, will not be interpreted as awarding a former spouse annuity under CSRS.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Specificity Required To Award a Former Spouse Annuity.</HD>
              <P>A. Orders must contain language identifying the benefits affected. For example, “CSRS,” “OPM,” or “Federal Government” survivor benefits, or “survivor benefits payable based on service with the U.S. Department of Agriculture,” etc., will be considered sufficient identification.</P>
              <P>B. 1. Except as provided paragraphs B2 through B4, orders must specify the benefit being awarded. Orders must contain language such as “survivor annuity,” “death benefits,” “former spouse annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8341(h)(1),” etc.</P>
              <P>2. Orders that provide that the former spouse is to “continue as” or “be named as” the “designated beneficiary” of CSRS benefits will be interpreted to award a former spouse annuity.</P>
              <P>3. Orders that provide that the former spouse will “continue to receive benefits after the death of” the employee or “that benefits will continue after the death of” the employee, but do not use terms such as “survivor annuity,” “death benefits,” “former spouse annuity,” or similar terms will not be interpreted to award a former spouse annuity.</P>

              <P>4. Orders that give the former spouse the right to elect a former spouse annuity will be interpreted to award a former spouse annuity. The former spouse does not have an election opportunity. OPM will not accept an <PRTPAGE P="263"/>election by the former spouse to eliminate the court-awarded former spouse annuity.</P>
              <P>C. 1. Orders that unequivocally award survivor annuity and direct the former spouse to pay for that benefit are qualifying court orders. If the former spouse has also been awarded a portion of the retiree's benefits then the cost of the survivor benefit will be deducted from the former spouse's portion of the annuity (if sufficient to cover the total cost—there will be no partial withholding). Otherwise, the reduction will be taken from the retiree's annuity and collection from the former spouse will be a private matter between the parties.</P>
              <P>2. Orders that condition the award of survivor annuity on the former spouse's payment of the cost of the benefit are qualifying only if there is also an award of retirement benefits sufficient to cover the cost. Absent a sufficient award of employee retirement benefits to pay the cost of survivor benefits, the order is not qualifying.</P>
              <P>D. Orders providing that former spouses will keep the survivor annuity to which they were entitled at the time of the divorce will be interpreted to award a former spouse annuity in the same amount as they had at the time of divorce.</P>
              <P>E. Orders that fail to state the amount of the former spouse annuity will be interpreted as providing the maximum former spouse annuity.</P>
              <P>F. Orders awarding a former spouse annuity of less than $12 per year are qualifying court orders. Such orders will be interpreted to provide an initial rate of $1 per month plus all cost-of-living increases occurring after the date of the order. The reduction in the retiree's annuity will be computed as though the order provided a former spouse annuity of $1 per month.</P>
              <P>G. Orders that provide <E T="03">full</E> survivor annuity benefits to a former spouse with the contingency that the employee or annuitant may elect a <E T="03">lesser</E> benefit for the former spouse upon his or her remarriage will be interpreted to provide only a full survivor annuity benefit to the former spouse. In order to provide full survivor annuity benefits to a former spouse with the contingency that the employee or annuitant may provide a lesser survivor annuity benefit to the former spouse in order to provide survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse, the order should allow a reduction in the former spouse benefit contingent upon the employee's or annuitant's <E T="03">election</E> of survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse. A reduction in the amount of survivor benefits provided to the former spouse will not be permitted if it is contingent upon the employee's or annuitant's <E T="03">remarriage</E> rather than his or her <E T="03">election</E> of survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse.

              <SUBJECT>What is the Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act (FERCCA) is Title II of Public Law 106-265, enacted September 19, 2000. The FERCCA addresses the problems created when employees are in the wrong retirement plan for an extended period.</P>
              <P>(b) Generally, you must be in the wrong retirement plan for at least 3 years of service after December 31, 1986, before the FERCCA applies to you. Depending on the type of error, the FERCCA provides:</P>
              <P>(1) A choice between retirement plans,</P>
              <P>(2) New rules for crediting civilian and military service that was not subject to retirement deductions,</P>
              <P>(3) Payment of lost earnings on employee make-up contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan, and</P>
              <P>(4) Payment of certain out-of-pocket expenses that are a direct result of a retirement coverage error.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Do these rules apply to me?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) These rules apply to employees who had a qualifying retirement coverage error. For all purposes, a qualifying retirement coverage error must have lasted for at least 3 years of Federal service after December 31, 1986, as stated in the definitions section (§ 839.102). It does not matter whether you have left Federal service, retired, or have been reemployed as an annuitant, as long as you had a qualifying retirement coverage error. In addition, the survivor of an employee, separated employee, or retiree who had a qualifying retirement coverage error is also covered by these rules.</P>
                <P>(b) An error that lasted less than 3 years of Federal service after December 31, 1986, is not qualifying under the rules in this part.</P>
                <P>(c) For errors lasting less than 3 years that involve erroneous placement in FERS during a period that the employee was eligible to elect FERS, see § 846.204(b) of this chapter for guidance.</P>

                <P>The FERCCA does not provide an election opportunity in all situations where there was a qualifying retirement coverage error. Even if your error is one that provides an election opportunity under the FERCCA, certain events may disqualify you from making an election under the FERCCA.

                <P>(a) You may not make a retirement coverage election if your qualifying retirement coverage error was previously <PRTPAGE P="270"/>corrected to FERS, and you later received one of the following TSP withdrawals:</P>
                <P>(1) A TSP annuity after separation from service, but before receiving a FERS annuity; or</P>
                <P>(2) A single payment or monthly payments after separation from service; or</P>
                <P>(3) An age-based in-service withdrawal.</P>
                <P>(b) If you received an automatic cashout of your TSP account after you separated (because your account balance was $3,500 or less), or if you received a financial hardship in-service withdrawal, you may make a retirement coverage election.</P>

                <P>You can make a retirement coverage election under the FERCCA if OPM waives repayment of the entire amount under § 839.1202. If OPM does not waive the entire repayment, you must pay back the amount that OPM did not waive.</P>

(See § 846.204(b)(2) of this chapter). If you already had this opportunity to choose your retirement coverage; then you may not make an election of retirement coverage based on the same error under these rules.</P>

                <P>You must be in the wrong retirement plan for at least 3 years of Federal service after December 31, 1986. You need not be in the same wrong retirement plan during the entire 3-year period. If you had more than one type of erroneous retirement coverage, then you will have a retirement plan election under these rules if one of the errors is of a type that qualifies you for an election.</P>

              <P>(a) If you are an employee, your employer has your personnel records and will review them to determine whether an error has been made. Therefore, you should notify your employer's human resources office if you believe an error has been made in your case. Notify your current employer even if you believe the error occurred while you were employed at another agency.</P>

              <P>(b) If you are not currently employed by the Federal Government, you should notify OPM at: U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Retirement Operations Center, Post Office Box 45, Boyers, Pennsylvania 16017. You can also contact us by electronic mail at <E T="03">FERCCA@OPM.GOV.</E> Notify OPM regardless of whether you are a retiree, survivor, or separated employee.</P>

              <P>(a) Your employer must provide you with written notice of the error. The notice must include an explanation of the error, your options regarding the error, and any time limits that apply.</P>
              <P>(b) Your employer must inform you if they find that you do not have a retirement coverage error.</P>

              <P>(b) If your error was previously corrected, the 18-month time limit on making an election of retirement coverage ends on September 19, 2002.

                <P>(a) No, your employer is responsible for paying any additional amount to the Fund. Your employer will not bill you for any additional retirement deductions.</P>
                <P>(b) For qualifying retirement coverage errors corrected under this part, the rules at § 831.111(b) of this chapter (pertaining to employee options when the employer fails to withhold CSRS or CSRS Offset retirement deductions) do not apply.</P>

                <P>CSRS Offset and FERS require employees to pay Social Security taxes in addition to retirement deductions. When you are retroactively changed under the FERCCA to CSRS Offset, FERS, or Social Security-Only, the deductions you paid in under CSRS will be used to pay both the amounts required for retirement deductions under CSRS Offset or FERS, as applicable to you, and also the Social Security taxes that you would have paid had you been in CSRS-Offset, FERS, or Social Security-Only.</P>

                <SUBJECT>If my qualifying retirement coverage error occurred while I was a reemployed annuitant, and I am later corrected retroactively to a different retirement plan, will I have to pay any additional amount for retirement deductions?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If you (as a reemployed annuitant) were erroneously in CSRS and had retirement deductions withheld from pay, and later are corrected to CSRS Offset or FERS coverage, the amount erroneously withheld under CSRS will be used to pay the retroactive CSRS Offset or FERS retirement deductions and Social Security taxes.</P>

If you are corrected to CSRS Offset, you may elect to have retirement deductions withheld from future salary as a reemployed annuitant and may also make a deposit to cover the retirement deductions for past service as a reemployed annuitant in accordance with § 837.503(c) of this chapter. If you are corrected to FERS, your retirement deductions under FERS will be treated as an overpayment of salary.</P>
                <P>(c) If you (as a reemployed annuitant) were erroneously in CSRS Offset and had retirement deductions withheld from pay, and later are corrected to CSRS or FERS coverage, the amount erroneously withheld under CSRS Offset will be used to pay the retroactive CSRS or FERS retirement deductions. The employer is responsible for paying to the Fund any additional retirement deductions.</P>
                <P>(d) If you (as a reemployed annuitant) were erroneously placed in CSRS Offset and elected not to have retirement deductions withheld from pay, and later are corrected to CSRS, you may elect to have retirement deductions withheld from future salary as a reemployed annuitant and may also make a deposit to cover the retirement deductions for past service as a reemployed annuitant in accordance with § 837.503(c) of this chapter. Your retirement deductions under CSRS will be treated as an overpayment of salary.</P>
                <P>(e) If you (as a reemployed annuitant) were erroneously placed in CSRS Offset and elected not to have retirement deductions withheld from pay, and later are corrected to FERS, your retirement deductions under FERS will be treated as an overpayment of salary.</P>
                <P>(f) A reemployed annuitant erroneously placed in FERS and later corrected to CSRS or CSRS Offset is considered to have elected retirement deductions as a reemployed annuitant under the corrected coverage. The employer is responsible for paying to the Fund any additional retirement deductions under the corrected retirement coverage.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will OPM compute the amount of lost earnings?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Lost earnings will generally be computed in accordance with the Board's lost earnings regulations (5 CFR 1606 of chapter VI). However, the FERCCA states that OPM may compute the lost earnings in an alternative manner if such a computation is not administratively feasible. The alternative manner will yield an amount that is as close as practicable to the amount computed under 5 CFR 1606 of chapter VI.</P>
              <P>(b) Your employer is required to submit to OPM all information required to compute the amount of lost earnings.</P>

              <P>(a) Yes. If the TSP account is not withdrawn, the lost earnings are paid to the account.</P>
              <P>(b) If there is no TSP account at the time the lost earnings are payable, you or your survivors will receive the payment directly.</P>

                <P>No, employees who should have been automatically placed in FERS (generally because they did not have 5 years of past service under CSRS rules) do not have a CSRS component in their future FERS benefit. All service must be treated as FERS service in this circumstance.</P>

                <P>Your annuity may be subject to three possible actuarial reductions under the FERCCA. These reductions may be required for an unpaid deposit (see § 831.303(d) and § 839.1116 of this chapter), for Government contributions in a TSP account (see § 839.1118), or for a previous payment of the Basic Employee Death Benefit (see § 839.1121).</P>

                <SUBJECT>What is an actuarial reduction?</SUBJECT>
                <P>An actuarial reduction allows you to receive benefits without having to pay an amount due in a lump sum. OPM reduces your annuity in a way that, on average, allows the Fund to recover the amount of the missing lump sum over your lifetime. The actuarial reduction becomes a permanent reduction in your benefit. The amount of the reduction depends on your age and the amount of the lump sum you would otherwise have to pay at that time. To compute an actuarial reduction, OPM divides the lump sum amount by the present value factor for your age at retirement.</P>

                <SUBJECT>If, because of the change in my retirement coverage, I will owe larger deposits for military and civilian service credit, will I have to pay the additional deposit due or will OPM actuarially reduce my annuity?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You can choose to pay the additional deposit amount. If you choose not to pay the deposit, OPM will actuarially reduce your annuity, as explained in 831.303(d) of this chapter.</P>

                <SUBJECT>If I elect to change my retirement coverage under the FERCCA, can I get a refund of the service credit deposit I made and receive the actuarial reduction instead?</SUBJECT>
                <P>No, the FERCCA allows OPM to reduce an annuity by an actuarial reduction only for the deposit amount that remains unpaid.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Will my annuity be actuarially reduced because I had Government contributions in my TSP account?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Retirees and survivors of deceased employees who received a Government contribution to their TSP account after being corrected to FERS and who later elect CSRS Offset under the FERCCA are allowed to keep the Government contributions, and earnings on the Government contributions in the TSP account. Instead of adjusting the TSP account, the FERCCA requires that the CSRS-Offset annuity be reduced actuarially.</P>

                <P>(a) The part of your TSP account on the date you retired that is Government contributions and earnings on those Government contributions forms the basis for the actuarial reduction. OPM will divide the Government contributions and earnings by the present value factor for your age (in full years) at the time you retired. OPM will then round the result to the next highest dollar amount, which will be the monthly actuarial reduction amount.</P>
                <P>(b) If a survivor annuity is the only benefit that is payable, the present value factor for the survivor's age at the time of death is used. The survivor benefit is not reduced for TSP if the retiree's rate was reduced.</P>

                <P>If you received a BEDB under FERS and you elect CSRS Offset under these rules, you do not have to pay back the BEDB. Instead, the FERCCA requires that OPM actuarially reduce your survivor annuity. The reduction will be the amount of the BEDB divided by the present value factor for your age at the time of the employee's death. The result is rounded to the next highest dollar amount and is the monthly actuarial reduction amount. If you elected to receive the BEDB in installments rather than a lump sum, the lump-sum amount is used for the purpose of computing the actuarial reduction.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Correction of unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When an “appropriate authority” determines that there has been an “unjustified or unwarranted personnel action” as these terms are defined in subpart H of part 550 of this title, the employing agency will pay the Fund the amount of the normal cost percentage of the basic pay included in back pay. The normal cost percentage owed the Fund is computed on the amount of gross basic pay without regard to deductions described in § 550.805(e) of this chapter for other amounts earned or erroneous payments received.</P>
              <P>(b) The agency will withhold the appropriate employee deductions from the amount of basic pay included in gross back pay giving due regard to deductions described in § 550.805(e) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) The payment to the Fund described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made within the time period established by OPM standards.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Any FERS benefits—lump-sum payments or annuity benefits—paid based on a separation that is later cancelled are considered erroneous payments that must be repaid to OPM. Agencies must deduct such payments from any back pay adjustment to which the employee may be entitled as required by 5 CFR 550.805(e).</P>
              <P>(2) Amounts recovered from back pay will not be subject to waiver consideration under 5 U.S.C. 8470(b). If there is no back pay, or the back pay is insufficient to recover the entire erroneous payment, the employee may request that OPM waive recovery of the uncollected portion of the overpayment. If waiver is not granted, the employee must repay the erroneous payment.</P>

              <P>(e) A retiree who was covered under FERS for at least one month has a FERS component. If the amount of the FERS component as computed under paragraph (d) of this section is zero (because the CSRS component is equal to the monthly rate, leaving no balance for the FERS component), the FERS component is $1 per month. The retiree is due a full dollar increase on the FERS component with the next COLA. An employee with less than a month of FERS service has no FERS component and is not due any FERS COLA's.</P>

              <P>(f) COLA's are determined by applying the appropriate increase to each component and rounding to the next lower dollar (each component must increase by at least one dollar if a COLA <PRTPAGE P="300"/>applies to each component) before adding them together for the new monthly amount payable.</P>

If the magnetic tape submitted by the State cannot be read, OPM will notify the State of this fact, and if a satisfactory replacement can be supplied in time for monthly processing, it will be processed.</P>
              <P>(b) Deduct from the regular, recurring annuity payments of an annuitant the amount he or she has so requested to be withheld, provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount of the request is an even dollar amount, not less than Five Dollars nor more than the net recurring amount. The State may set any even dollar amount above Five Dollars as a minimum withholding amount.</P>
              <P>(2) The annuitant has not designated more than one other State for withholding purposes within the calendar year. The State can set any limit on the number of changes an annuitant may make in the amount to be withheld.</P>
              <P>(c) Retain the amounts withheld in the Fund until payment is due.</P>
              <P>(d) Pay the net withholding to the State on the last day of the first month following each calendar quarter.</P>
              <P>(e) Make the following reports:</P>
              <P>(1) A monthly report which will include all the State tax withholdings, cancellations and adjustments for the month, and also each request OPM was not able to process, with an explanation, in coded format, of the reason for rejection.</P>
              <P>(2) A quarterly report which will include State, State address, quarterly withholdings, quarterly cancellations and adjustments, quarterly net withholdings and year-to-date amounts. Where cancelled or adjusted payments were made in a previous year, OPM shall append a listing of the cancelled or adjusted payments which shows the date and amount of each cancelled or adjusted tax withholding, and the name and Social Security identification number of the annuitant from whom it was withheld. If either party terminates the agreement and the amount of cancelled or adjusted deductions exceeds the amount withheld for the final quarter, then the quarterly report shall show the amount to be refunded to OPM and the address to which payment should be made.</P>

              <P>(3) An annual summary report which contains the name, Social Security identification number, and total amount withheld from non-cancelled payments during the previous calendar year, for each annuitant who requested tax withholding payable to the State. In the event the annuitant had State income tax withholding in effect for more than one State in that calendar <PRTPAGE P="303"/>year, the report will show only the amount withheld for the State receiving the report.</P>
              <P>(4) An annual report to each annuitant for whom State income taxes were withheld giving the amount of withholding paid to the State during the calendar year.</P>

              <P>The State will, in performance of this agreement:</P>
              <P>(a) Accept requests and revocations from annuitants who have designated that State income tax deductions will go to the State.</P>
              <P>(b) Convert these requests on a monthly basis to a machine-readable magnetic tape using specifications received from OPM, and forward that tape to OPM for processing.</P>
              <P>(c) Inform annuitants whose tax requests are rejected by OPM that the request was so rejected and of the reason why it was so rejected.</P>
              <P>(d) Recognize that, to the extent not prohibited by State laws, records maintained by the State relating to this program are considered jointly maintained by OPM and are subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). Accordingly, the States will maintain such records in accordance with that statute and OPM's implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 297.</P>
              <P>(e) Respond to requests of annuitants for information and advice in regard to State income tax withholding.</P>
              <P>(f) Credit the amounts withheld from FERS annuities to the State tax liability of the respective annuitants, and, subject to applicable provisions of State law to the contrary, refund any balance over and above that liability to the annuitant, unless he or she should request otherwise.</P>

              <P>These additional provisions are also binding on the State and OPM:</P>
              <P>(a) A request or revocation is effective when processed by OPM. OPM will process each request by the first day of the second month following the month in which it is received, but incurs no liability or indebtedness by its failure to do so.</P>
              <P>(b) Any amount deducted from an annuity payment and paid to the State as a result of a request is deemed properly paid, unless the annuity payment itself is cancelled.</P>
              <P>(c) OPM will provide the State with the information necessary to properly process a request for State income tax withholding.</P>
              <P>(d) If the State is paid withholding which is contrary to the terms of the annuitant's request, the State is liable to the annuitant for the amount improperly withheld, and subject to account verification from OPM, agrees to pay that amount to the annuitant on demand.</P>
              <P>(e) In the case of a dispute amount in any of the reports described and authorized by this agreement, the Associate Director will issue an accounting. If the State finds this accounting unacceptable, it may then and only then pursue such remedies as are otherwise available.</P>
              <P>(f) If a State received an overpayment of monies properly belonging to the Fund, OPM will offset the overpayment from a future payment due the State. If there are no further payments due the State, OPM will inform the State in writing of the amount due. Within 60 days of the date of receipt of that communication that State will make payment of the amount due.</P>

              <P>(6) The total number of non-temporary employees in the agency (or specified component(s)) who may be involuntarily separated, downgraded, transferred, or reassigned as a result of the substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring or reshaping;</P>
              <P>(7) The total number of employees in the agency (or specified component(s)) who are eligible for voluntary early retirement;</P>
              <P>(8) An estimate of the total number of employees in the agency (or specified component(s)) who are expected to retire early during the period covered by the request for voluntary early retirement authority; and</P>
              <P>(9) A description of the types of personnel actions anticipated as a result of the agency's need for voluntary early retirement authority. Examples include separations, transfers, reassignments, and downgradings.</P>
              <P>(d) OPM will evaluate a request for voluntary early retirement based on:</P>
              <P>(1) A specific request to OPM from the agency for voluntary early retirement authority;</P>
              <P>(2) A voluntary separation incentive payment implementation plan, as discussed in part 576, subpart A, of this chapter, which must outline the intended use of the incentive payments and voluntary early retirement; or</P>
              <P>(3) The agency's human capital plan, which must outline its intended use of voluntary separation incentive payments and voluntary early retirement authority, and the changes in organizational structure it expects to make as the result of projected separations and early retirements.</P>
              <P>(e) Regardless of the method used, the request must include all of the information required by paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) OPM may approve an agency's request for voluntary early retirement authority to cover the entire period of the substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring or reshaping described by the agency, or the initial portion of that period with a requirement for subsequent information and justification if the period covers multiple years.</P>
              <P>(g) After OPM approves an agency's request, the agency must immediately notify OPM of any subsequent changes in the conditions that served as the basis for the approval of the voluntary early retirement authority. Depending upon the circumstances involved, OPM will modify the authority as necessary to better suit the agency's needs.</P>
              <P>(h) The agency may further limit voluntary early retirement offers based on:</P>
              <P>(1) An established opening and closing date for the acceptance of applications that is announced to employees at the time of the offer; or</P>
              <P>(2) The acceptance of a specified number of applications for voluntary early retirement, provided that, at the time of the offer, the agency notified employees that it retained the right to limit the number of voluntary early retirements.</P>
              <P>(i) Within the timeframe specified for its approved voluntary early retirement authority, the agency may subsequently establish a new or revised closing date, or reduce or increase the number of early retirement applications it will accept, if management's downsizing and/or reshaping needs change. If the agency issues a revised closing date, or a revised number of applications to be accepted, the new date or number of applications must be announced to the same group of employees included in the original announcement. If the agency issues a new window period with a new closing date, or a new instance of a specific number of applications to be accepted, the new window period or number of applications to be accepted may be announced to a different group of employees as long as they are covered by the approved voluntary early retirement authority.</P>

              <P>(j) Chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, requires that agencies treat employees on military duty, for all practical purposes, as though they were still on the job. Further, employees are not to be disadvantaged because of their military service. In accordance with these provisions, employees on military duty who would otherwise be eligible for an offer of voluntary early retirement will have 30 days following their return to duty to either accept or <PRTPAGE P="315"/>reject an offer of voluntary early retirement. This will be true even if the voluntary early retirement authority provided by OPM has expired.</P>
              <P>(k) An employee who separates from the service voluntarily after completing 25 years of service, or becoming age 50 and completing 20 years of service, is entitled to an annuity if, on the date of separation, the employee:</P>
              <P>(1) Is serving in a position covered by a voluntary early retirement offer; and</P>
              <P>(2) Meets the following conditions which are covered in 5 U.S.C. 8414(b)(1)(B):</P>
              <P>(i) Has been employed continuously, by the agency in which the employee is serving, for at least the 31-day period ending on the date on which such agency requests the determination referred to in section 842.213(b);</P>
              <P>(ii) Is serving under an appointment that is not time limited;</P>
              <P>(iii) Has not been duly notified that such employee is to be involuntarily separated for misconduct or unacceptable performance;</P>
              <P>(iv) Is separated from the service voluntarily during a period in which, as determined by the Office of Personnel Management (upon request of the agency) under regulations prescribed by the Office:</P>
              <P>(A) Such agency (or, if applicable, the component in which the employee is serving) is undergoing substantial delayering, substantial reorganization, substantial reductions in force, substantial transfer of function, or other substantial workforce restructuring (or shaping);</P>
              <P>(B) A significant percentage of employees serving in such agency (or component) are likely to be separated or subject to an immediate reduction in the rate of basic pay (without regard to subchapter VI of chapter 53, or comparable provisions); or</P>
              <P>(C) Identified as being in positions which are becoming surplus or excess to the agency's future ability to carry out its mission effectively; and</P>
              <P>(v) As determined by the agency under regulations prescribed by the Office, is within the scope of the offer of voluntary early retirement, which may be made based on the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(A) 1 or more organizational units;</P>
              <P>(B) 1 or more occupational series or levels;</P>
              <P>(C) 1 or more geographical locations;</P>
              <P>(D) Specific periods;</P>
              <P>(E) Skills, knowledge, or other factors related to a position; or</P>
              <P>(F) Any appropriate combination of such factors.</P>
              <P>(l) Agencies are responsible for ensuring that employees are not coerced into voluntary early retirement. If an agency finds any instances of coercion, it must take appropriate corrective action.</P>
              <P>(m) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, an agency may not offer or process voluntary early retirements beyond the stated expiration date of a voluntary early retirement authority or offer early retirements to employees who are not within the scope of the voluntary early retirement authority approved by OPM.</P>
              <P>(n) OPM may terminate a voluntary early retirement authority if it determines that the condition(s) that formed the basis for the approval of the authority no longer exist.</P>
              <P>(o) OPM may amend, limit, or terminate a voluntary early retirement authority to ensure that the requirements of this subpart are properly being followed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Deposits for civilian service.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility—current and former employees or Members.</E> An employee or Member subject to FERS and a former employee or Member who is entitled to an annuity may make a deposit for civilian service described under paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of § 842.304 upon application to OPM in a form prescribed by OPM. A deposit for civilian service cannot be made later than 30 <PRTPAGE P="319"/>days after the first regular monthly payment as defined in § 842.602.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligibility—survivors.</E> If an employee or Member was, at the time of death, eligible to make a deposit, the employee's survivor may make the deposit for civilian service. A deposit under this paragraph cannot be made after adjudication of the survivor's application for benefits becomes final, which is 30 days after the date of OPM's notice to the survivor of the annuity rates with and without making the deposit.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Distinct period of service.</E> A deposit is not considered to have been made for any distinct period of service unless the total amount due for the period is paid in full.

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Amount of deposits.</E> The amount of a deposit for a period of service under § 842.304(a)(2) equals 1.3 percent of the basic pay for the service, plus interest. The amount of a deposit for a period of service under § 842.304(a)(3) equals the amount that would have been deducted from pay under 5 U.S.C. 8422(a) had the employee been subject to FERS during the service, plus interest.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Interest.</E> (1) Interest is charged at the rate of 4 percent a year through December 31, 1947; 3 percent a year beginning January 1, 1948, through December 31, 1984; and thereafter at a rate as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for each calendar year that equals the overall average yield to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (the Fund) during the preceding fiscal year from all obligations purchased by the Secretary during such fiscal year under 5 U.S.C. 8348 (c), (d), and (e).</P>
              <P>(2) The computation of interest is on the basis of 30 days to the month. Interest is computed for the actual calendar time involved in each case; but, whenever applicable, the rule of average applies.</P>
              <P>(3) Interest is computed from the midpoint of each service period included in the computation. The interest accrues annually on the outstanding portion, and is compounded annually, until the portion is deposited. Interest is not charged after the commencing date of annuity or for a period of separation from the service that began before October 1, 1956.</P>

The rate of basic pay for this purpose is deemed to be $15 per month for the first 9 months of study; $20 per month for the 10th through the 21st months of study; and $30 per month for any month in excess of 21 months. Interest is computed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The employing agency must establish a deposit account showing the total amount due and a payment schedule (unless deposit is made in one lump sum) to record the date and amount of each payment.</P>
              <P>(3) If the individual cannot make payment in one lump sum, the employing agency must accept installment payments (by allotments or otherwise). The employing agency, however, is not required to accept individual checks in amounts less than $50.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Military service.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), and unless otherwise provided under title III of the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986, an employee's or Member's military service is creditable if it was performed—</P>
              <P>(1) Before January 1, 1957; or</P>
              <P>(2) After December 31, 1956, subject to payment, before separation from service, of the deposit required by § 842.307.</P>
              <P>(b) Credit for a period of military service is not allowed if the employee or Member is receiving military retired pay for such period awarded for reasons other than—</P>
              <P>(1) Service-connected disability incurred in combat with an enemy of the United States;</P>
              <P>(2) Service-connected disability caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in the line of duty during a period of war (within the meaning of chapter 11 of title 38, United States Code); or</P>
              <P>(3) Retirement under chapter 67 of title 10, United States Code.</P>
              <P>(c) When adjudicating annuity claims, OPM will accept determinations made by the agency that authorized military retired pay concerning—</P>
              <P>(1) The effective date of a waiver of military retired pay;</P>
              <P>(2) Whether an individual's military retired pay was awarded for any of the reasons mentioned under paragraph (b) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(3) Whether a period of military service forms the basis for military retired pay.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, the computation of a survivor's annuity includes credit for any military service allowable under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the separated employee (as defined in § 843.102 of this chapter) was awarded military retired pay, died after the date of separation from civilian service, and did not waive military retired pay effective before the date of death, military service upon which the military retired pay was based is not creditable.</P>
              <P>(3) If the survivor of a deceased employee who had been awarded military retired pay files, in a form prescribed by OPM, an election not to have a period of military service included in the computation of survivor benefits, that period of military service is not included in the computation of survivor benefits.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Deposits for military service.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility to make a deposit.</E> (1) An employee or Member subject to FERS may make a deposit for any distinct period of military service by filing an application in a form prescribed by OPM.</P>
              <P>(2) An application to make a deposit is filed with the appropriate office in the employing agency, or, for Members and Congressional employees, with the Secretary of the Senate, or the Clerk of the House of Representatives, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) An employee's or Member's deposit for military service must be completed before separation from service. If a deceased employee or Member was, at the time of death, eligible to make a deposit, the employee's or Member's survivor may make the deposit in one lump sum to the former employing agency, the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House of Representatives, before OPM completes adjudication of the survivor annuity application. A person who was eligible to make a deposit for military service but failed to complete the deposit within the time limits provided in this paragraph, may complete the deposit in a lump sum within the time limit set by OPM when it rules that an administrative error has been made.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of deposit.</E> (1) The amount of a deposit for military service equals 3 percent of the basic pay for the service under 37 U.S.C. 207, or an estimate of the basic pay (see paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section), plus interest, unless interest is not required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) Interest is charged at a rate as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for each calendar year that <PRTPAGE P="323"/>equals the overall average yield to the Fund during the preceding fiscal year from all obligations purchased by the Secretary during such fiscal year under 5 U.S.C. 8348(c), (d), and (e).</P>
              <P>(3) The computation of interest is on the basis of 30 days to the month. Interest is computed for the actual calendar time involved in each case; but whenever applicable, the rule of average applies.</P>
              <P>(4) Interest is computed from the mid-point of each full period of service included in the computation. The interest accrues annual on the outstanding portion beginning on the second anniversary of the employee's or Member's beginning date of coverage under FERS, and is compounded annually, until the portion is deposited. Interest is charged to the date of deposit. No interest will be charged if the deposit is completed before the end of the year after interest begins. For example, if an employee becomes subject to FERS on March 1, 1988, interest begins to accrue on March 1, 1990; however, no interest would be included in the deposit due if the deposit is completed by February 28, 1991.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Processing deposit applications and payments.</E> (1) The agency, Clerk of the House of Representatives, or Secretary of the Senate will have the employee or Member—</P>
              <P>(i) Complete an application to make deposit;</P>
              <P>(ii) Provided a copy of his or her DD Form 214 or its equivalent to verify the period(s) of service; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Provide copies of all official military pay documents, as identified in instructions issued by OPM, which show the exact basic pay he or she received for full period of service; or, if such evidence is not available, obtain a statement of estimated earnings from the appropriate branch of the military service and submit the statement.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon receipt of the application, the DD Form 214, and either the evidence of exact basic pay or the statement of estimated earnings, the agency, Clerk of the House of Representatives, or Secretary of the Senate will establish a deposit account showing—</P>
              <P>(i) The total amount due, including interest, if any;</P>
              <P>(ii) A payment schedule (unless deposit is made in a lump sum); and</P>
              <P>(iii) The date and amount of each payment.</P>
              <P>(3) Deposits may be made in a single lump sum or in installments. The agency, Clerk of the House of Representatives, and Secretary of the Senate are not required to accept installment payments in amounts less than $50.</P>
              <P>(4) Payments received by the employing agency, the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or the Secretary of the Senate will be remitted to OPM for deposit to the Fund in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Distinct periods of service.</E> A deposit is not considered to have been made for any distinct period of service unless the total amount due for the period is paid in full. A “distinct period” for this purpose is the total years, months, and days from the date of entry on active duty (or from January 1, 1957, if later) to the date of final discharge for enlisted military personnel, or to the date of final release from active duty for officers and reservists. A “distinct period” also includes consecutive periods of service where there is no break in service, but does not include any lost time.</P>

              <P>(c) An employee or Member, who, before becoming subject to FERS, made a deposit for military service is eligible upon proper application in a form prescribed by OPM, while currently employed, for a refund of the amount deposited, excluding interest, to the extent that this amount exceeds the amount of the deposit required for such service under § 842.307.</P>
              <P>(d) A former employee or Member who, before becoming subject to FERS, made a deposit for military service is eligible for a refund, upon proper application in a form prescribed by OPM. The former employee or Member may irrevocably elect to receive either—</P>

              <P>(5)(i) A retiring employee or Member may not elect a fully reduced annuity or a one-half reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity and an insurable interest rate to benefit the same former spouse.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a retiring employee or Member who is required by court order to provide a former spouse annuity elects an insurable interest rate to benefit the former spouse with the court-ordered entitlement—</P>
              <P>(A) If the benefit based on the election is greater than or equal to the benefit based on the court order, the election of the insurable interest rate will satisfy the requirements of the court order as long as the insurable interest rate continues.</P>
              <P>(B) If the benefit based on the election is less than the benefit based on the court order, the election of the insurable interest rate is void.</P>

              <P>(2) For purposes of this section, the term “same-sex domestic partner” means a person in a domestic partnership with an employee or annuitant of the same sex, and the term “domestic partnership” is defined as a committed relationship between two adults, of the same sex, in which the partners—</P>
              <P>(i) Are each other's sole domestic partner and intend to remain so indefinitely;</P>
              <P>(ii) Maintain a common residence, and intend to continue to do so (or would maintain a common residence but for an assignment abroad or other employment-related, financial, or similar obstacle);</P>

              <P>(vii) Are not related in a way that, if they were of opposite sex, would prohibit legal marriage in the U.S. jurisdiction in which the domestic partnership was formed; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Are willing to certify, if required by the agency, that they understand that willful falsification of any documentation required to establish that an individual is in a domestic partnership may lead to disciplinary action and the recovery of the cost of benefits received related to such falsification, as well as constitute a criminal violation under 18 U.S.C. 1001, and that the method for securing such certification, if required, shall be determined by the agency.</P>
              <P>(3) When an insurable interest is not presumed, the employee or Member must submit affidavits from one or more persons with personal knowledge of the named beneficiary's having an insurable interest in the employee or Member. The affidavits must set forth the relationship, if any, between the named beneficiary and the employee or Member, the extent to which the named beneficiary is dependent on the employee or Member, and the reasons why the named beneficiary might reasonably expect to derive financial benefit from the continued life of the employee or Member.</P>
              <P>(4) The employee or Member may be required to submit documentary evidence to establish the named beneficiary's date of birth.</P>
              <P>(f) OPM will notify the employee or Member of initial monthly annuity rates with and without the election of an insurable interest rate and the initial rate payable to the named beneficiary. No election of an insurable interest rate is effective unless the employee or Member confirms the election in writing or dies no later than 60 days after the date of the notice described in this paragraph.</P>

              <P>(g)(1) When an employee or Member elects both an insurable interest rate, and a fully reduced annuity or a one-half reduced annuity, the combined reduction may exceed the maximum 40 percent reduction in the retired employee's or Member's annuity permitted under section 8420 of title 5, <PRTPAGE P="332"/>United States Code, applicable to insurable interest annuities.</P>
              <P>(2) The additional reduction to provide a current spouse annuity or a former spouse annuity is not considered in determining the rate of annuity payable to a beneficiary of an insurable interest election.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) Except as provided in § 842.604(d), if a retiree who is receiving a fully reduced annuity or a one-half reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity has also elected an insurable interest rate to benefit a current spouse and if the eligible former spouse remarries before age 55, dies, or loses eligibility under the terms of the court order, and no other former spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity based on an election made in accordance with § 842.611 or a qualifying court order, the retiree may elect, within 2 years after the former spouse's remarriage, death, or loss of eligibility under the terms of the court order, to convert the insurable interest rate to a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, effective on the first day of the month following the event causing the former spouse to lose eligibility.</P>
              <P>(2) An election under paragraph (h)(1) of this section cancels any consent not to receive a current spouse annuity required by paragraph (c) of this section for the current spouse to be eligible for an annuity under this section.</P>
              <P>(3) When a former spouse receiving an annuity under section 8445 of title 5, United States Code, loses eligibility to that annuity, a beneficiary of an insurable interest rate who was the current spouse at both the time of the retiree's retirement and death may, within 2 years after the former spouse's death, remarriage, or loss of eligibility under the terms of the court order, elect to receive a current spouse annuity instead of the annuity he or she had been receiving.</P>
              <P>The election is effective on the first day of the month following the event causing the former spouse to lose eligibility.</P>
              <P>(i) Upon the death of the current spouse, a retiree whose annuity is reduced to provide both a current spouse annuity and an insurable interest benefit for a former spouse is not permitted to convert the insurable interest rate to a reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity.</P>
              <P>(j) An employee or Member may name only one natural person as the named beneficiary of an insurable interest rate. OPM will not accept the designation of contingent beneficiaries and such a designation is void.</P>
              <P>(k)(1) An election under this section is prospectively voided by an election of a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity under § 842.612 that would benefit the same person.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) If the current spouse is not the beneficiary of the election under this section, a retiree may prospectively void an election under this section at the time the retiree elects a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity under § 842.612.</P>
              <P>(ii) A retiree's election to void an election under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section must be filed at the same time as the election under § 842.612.</P>
              <P>(3) An annuity reduction under this section terminates on the first day of the month after the beneficiary of the insurable interest rate dies.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in § 842.611, § 842.612, or paragraph (b) of this section, an employee or Member may not revoke or change the election or name another survivor later than 30 days after the date of the first regular monthly payment.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Except as provided in § 842.605 and paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, a retiree who was married at the time of retirement and has elected a self-only annuity, a one-half reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, a fully reduced annuity or a one-half reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity, or an insurable interest rate may elect, no later than 18 months after the time of retirement, an annuity reduction or an increased annuity reduction to provide a current spouse annuity.</P>
              <P>(2) A current spouse annuity based on an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section cannot be paid if it will, when combined with any former spouse annuity or annuities that are required by court order, exceed the maximum survivor annuity permitted under § 842.613.</P>

              <P>(3) To make an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the retiree <PRTPAGE P="334"/>must pay, in full no later than 18 months after the time of retirement, a deposit equal to the sum of the monthly differences between the annuity paid to the retiree and the annuity that would have been paid if the additional annuity reduction elected under paragraph (b)(1) of this section had been in effect since the time of retirement, plus—</P>
              <P>(i) If the election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section changes the annuity from a self only annuity to a fully reduced annuity, 24.5 percent of the retiree's annual annuity, plus 6 percent interest on both; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If the election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section changes the annuity from a self only annuity to a one-half reduced annuity or from a one-half reduced annuity to a fully reduced annuity, 12.25 percent of the retiree's annual annuity, plus 6 percent interest on both.</P>
              <P>(4) If a retiree makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and is prevented from paying the deposit within the 18-month time limit because OPM did not send him or her a notice of the amount of the deposit at least 30 days before the time limit expires, the time limit for making the deposit will be extended 30 days after OPM sends the notice of the amount of the deposit.</P>
              <P>(5) An election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section cancels any spousal consent under § 842.603.</P>
              <P>(6) An election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is void unless filed with OPM before the retiree dies.</P>
              <P>(7) If a retiree who had elected a fully reduced annuity or a one-half reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity (or annuities) makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section which would cause the combined current spouse annuity and former spouse annuity (or annuities) to exceed the maximum allowed under § 842.613, the former spouse annuity (or annuities) must be reduced to not exceed the maximum allowable under § 842.613.</P>

              <P>(i) Is smaller than the amount required by a qualifying court order; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Would cause the sum of all current and former spouse annuities based on a retiree's elections under §§ 842.603, 842.604, 842.612 and this section to exceed the maximum allowed under § 842.613.</P>
              <P>(3) An election under this section is void—</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of a married retiree, if the current spouse does not consent to the election on a form as described in § 842.606(c) and spousal consent is not waived by OPM in accordance with § 842.607; or</P>
              <P>(ii) To the extent that it provides a former spouse annuity for the spouse who was married to the retiree at the time of retirement in an amount that is inconsistent with any joint designation or waiver made at the time of retirement under § 842.603(a)(1) or (a)(2).</P>

              <P>(c) An election under this section is not permitted unless the retiree agrees to deposit the amount equal to the difference between the amount of annuity actually paid to the retiree and the amount of annuity that would have been paid if the reduction elected under paragraph (a) of this section had been in effect continuously since the time of retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest (computed under § 841.107 <PRTPAGE P="335"/>of this chapter) from the date when each difference occurred.</P>
              <P>(d) Any reduction in an annuity to provide a former spouse annuity will terminate on the first day of the month after the former spouse remarries before age 55 or dies, or the former spouse's eligibility for a former spouse annuity terminates under the terms of a qualifying court order, unless—</P>
              <P>(1) The retiree elects, within 2 years after the event causing the former spouse to lose eligibility, to continue the reduction to provide or increase a former spouse annuity for another former spouse, or to provide or increase a current spouse annuity; or</P>
              <P>(2) A qualifying court order requires the retiree to provide another former spouse annuity.</P>
              <P>(e) The amount of the reduction to provide one or more former spouse annuities or a combination of a current spouse annuity and one or more former spouse annuities under this section equals—</P>
              <P>(1) Ten percent of the employee's or Member's annuity if the employee or Member elects a fully reduced annuity; or</P>
              <P>(2) Five percent of the employee's or Member's annuity if the employee or Member elects a one-half reduced annuity.</P>

              <P>(2) An election under this section is effective when the marriage duration requirements of § 843.303 of this chapter are satisfied.<PRTPAGE P="336"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) If an election under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section does not become effective, no deposit under paragraph (d) of this section is required.</P>
              <P>(4) If payment of the deposit under paragraph (d) of this section is not required because the election never became effective and if some or all of the deposit has been paid, the amount paid will be returned to the retiree, or, if the retiree has died, to the person who would be entitled to any lump-sum benefits under the order of precedence in section 8424 of title 5, United States Code.</P>

              <P>(a) An agency head's determination under § 842.803(a) (finding that a position is a rigorous position) must be based solely on the official position description of the position in question and any other official description of duties and qualifications. The official documentation for the position should, as soon as is reasonably possible, establish that the primary duties of the position are so rigorous that the agency does not allow individuals to enter the position if they are over a certain age or if they fail to meet certain physical qualifications (that is, physical requirements and/or medical standards), as determined by the employing agency head based on the personnel management needs of the agency for the positions in question.</P>
              <P>(b) A determination under §§ 842.803 (b) or (c) must be based on the official position description and any other evidence deemed appropriate by the agency head for making the determination.</P>
              <P>(c) If an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. 8422(a)(2)(B), and the employee does not, within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position, formally and in writing seek a determination from the employing agency that his position is properly covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is presumed to be correct. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed.</P>

              <P>(a) During service covered under the conditions established by § 842.803 (a), (b), or (c), the employing agency will deduct and withhold from the employee's base pay the amounts required under 5 U.S.C. 8422(a)(2)(B) and submit that amount to OPM in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.</P>
              <P>(b) During service described in paragraph (a) of this section, the employing agency must submit to OPM the Government contributions required under 5 U.S.C. 8423(a)(1)(B) in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.</P>
              <P>(c) If the correct withholdings and/or Government contributions are not timely submitted to OPM for any reason whatsover, including cases in which it is finally determined that past service of a current or former employee was subject to the higher deduction and Government contribution rates, the employing agency must correct the error by submitting the correct amounts (including both employee and agency shares) to OPM as soon as possible. Even if the agency waives collection of the overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be available for this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to collect the debt, the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM as soon as possible.</P>

              <P>(d) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or eligible survivor of a former employee, an employing agency or former employing agency will pay a refund or erroneous additional withholdings for service that is found not to have been covered service. If an individual has paid to OPM a deposit or redeposit, including <PRTPAGE P="345"/>the additional amount required for covered service, and the deposit is later determined to be erroneous because the service was not covered service, OPM will pay the refund, upon proper application, to the individual, without interest.</P>
              <P>(e) The additional employee withholding and agency contributions for covered service properly made are not separately refundable, even in the event that the employee or his or her survivor does not qualify for a special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 8415(d).</P>
              <P>(f) While an employee who does not hold a rigorous, secondary, or air traffic controller position is detailed or temporarily promoted to such a position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will not be made.</P>
              <P>(g) While an employee who holds a rigorous, secondary, or air traffic controller position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a position that is not a rigorous, secondary, or air traffic controller position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will continue to be made.</P>

              <P>(a) The mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8425 apply to all law enforcement officers and firefighters, including those in secondary positions, and air traffic controllers, with the exception of a civilian employee of the Department of Transportation or the Department of Defense who is the immediate supervisor of a person described under 5 U.S.C. 2109(1)(B) (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a second-level supervisor). A mandatory separation under 5 U.S.C. 8425 is not an adverse action under part 752 of this chapter or a removal action under part 359 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) Exemptions from mandatory separation are subject to the conditions set forth under 5 U.S.C. 8425. An exemption may be granted at the sole discretion of the head of the employing agency or by the President in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8425(c).</P>
              <P>(c) In the event that an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 U.S.C. 8425, or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8412 (d) or (e), and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service required for entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position that did not meet the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the conditions set forth in this subpart or, if applicable, in part 831 of this chapter, such separation will be considered erroneous.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Oversight of coverage determinations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Upon deciding that a position is a law enforcement officer or firefighter position, each agency head must notify OPM (Attention: Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance) stating the title of each position, the number of incumbents, whether the position is rigorous or secondary, and, if the position is rigorous, the established maximum entry age (or if no maximum entry age has yet been established, the date by which it will be established). The Director of OPM retains the authority to overrule an agency head's determination that a position is a rigorous or secondary position, except such a determination under 5 U.S.C. 8401(17)(B) (concerning certain employees in the Departments of the Interior and the Treasury) or under 5 U.S.C. 8401(17)(D) (concerning certain positions primarily involved in detention activities).</P>

              <P>(b) Each agency must establish a file containing all coverage determinations <PRTPAGE P="346"/>made by an agency head under § 842.803, and all background material used in making the determination.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon request by OPM, the agency will make available the entire coverage determination file for OPM to audit to ensure compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon request by OPM, an agency must submit to OPM a list of all covered positions and any other pertinent information requested. For rigorous positions, the list must show the specific entry age requirement and physical qualification requirements for each position.</P>

              <P>(b) Any service as a law enforcement officer or firefighter, within the meaning of these terms under 5 U.S.C. 8331 (20) and (21), that was performed before the date on which an employee becomes subject to chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, is included in determining the employee's length of law enforcement officer and firefighter service under 5 U.S.C. 8412(d) for the purposes of retirement eligibility and mandatory separation under 5 U.S.C. 8425(b). Service performed as a law enforcement officer or firefighter within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8331, other than service in a supervisory or administrative position, is considered to be service in a rigorous position for the purpose of the 3-year requirement of § 842.803(b)(1)(ii). The FERS definitions of firefighter under 5 U.S.C. 8401(14) and law enforcement officer under 5 U.S.C. 8401(17) are not applicable to service performed—</P>
              <P>(1) Before 1987; or</P>
              <P>(2) After 1986 and before an employee first becomes subject to chapter 84 (that is, subject to FERS deductions), unless that service was neither subject to CSRS deductions nor creditable in a CSRS component as described in § 846.304(b).</P>

              <P>(2) An individual who—</P>
              <P>(i) Is covered as a law enforcement officer or firefighter under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) in a supervisory or administrative position, having already met the transfer requirement of subpart I of part 831 of this chapter; and</P>

L. 99-335) serving in a secondary position is considered to have met the 3-year requirement of § 842.803(b)(1)(ii) for coverage in a secondary position. The employee is not covered as a law enforcement officer or firefighter in a secondary position if he or she had a break in coverage as a law enforcement officer or firefighter (within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8331) exceeding 3 days immediately before becoming subject to chapter 84 of title 5 of United States Code. However, a break in coverage in supervisory or administrative positions occurring before the individual becomes subject to such chapter 84 that began with an involuntary separation (not for cause), within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8414(b)(1)(A), is not considered to be a break in service for this purpose.</P>

              <P>(d) (1) The CSRS definitions of law enforcement officer under 5 U.S.C. 8331(20) and firefighter under 5 U.S.C. <PRTPAGE P="347"/>8331(21) are applicable to service performed before an employee became subject to chapter 84 if the service was—</P>

              <SUBJECT>Conditions for coverage in secondary positions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by the Secretary of the Department of Energy to be a secondary nuclear materials courier position following 3 years of service in a primary nuclear materials courier position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8412(d) if all of the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The employee is transferred directly (i.e., without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary position; and</P>
              <P>(2) If applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in secondary positions since transferring from a primary position without a break in service exceeding 3 days, except that a break in employment in secondary positions which begins with an involuntary separation (not for cause), within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8414(b)(1)(A), is not considered in determining whether the service in secondary positions is continuous for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(b) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to a secondary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8412(d).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Evidence.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Secretary of Energy's determination under § 842.903 that a position is a primary position must be based solely on the official position description of the position in question, and any other official description of duties and qualifications. The official documentation for the position must establish that it satisfies the requirements defined in § 842.902.</P>
              <P>(b) A determination under § 842.904 must be based on the official position description and any other evidence deemed appropriate by the agency head for making the determination.</P>
              <P>(c) If an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. 8422(a)(3), and the employee does not, within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position, formally and in writing seek a determination from the employing agency that his or her service is properly covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is presumed to be correct. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requests from individuals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An employee who requests credit for service under 5 U.S.C. 8412(d) bears the burden of proof with respect to that service, and must provide the employing agency with all pertinent information regarding duties performed.</P>
              <P>(b) An employee who is currently serving in a position that has not been approved as a primary or secondary position, but who believes that his or her service is creditable as service in a primary or secondary position may request the agency head to determine whether or not the employee's current service should be credited and, if it qualifies, whether it should be credited as service in a primary or secondary position. A written request for current service must be made within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position.</P>
              <P>(c) A current or former employee (or the survivor of a former employee) who believes that a period of past service in an unapproved position qualifies as service in a primary or secondary position and meets the conditions for credit may request the agency head to determine whether or not the employee's past service should be credited and, if it qualifies, whether it should be credited as service in a primary or secondary position. A written request for past service must be made no later than December 31, 2000.</P>
              <P>(d) The agency head may extend the time limit for filing under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section when, in the judgment of such agency head, the individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withholding and contributions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) During service covered under the conditions established by § 842.903 (a) or (b), the Department of Energy will deduct and withhold from the employee's base pay the amounts required under 5 U.S.C. 8422(a)(3) and submit that amount to OPM in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.</P>
              <P>(b) During service described in paragraph (a) of this section, the employing agency must submit to OPM the Government contributions required under 5 U.S.C. 8423(a) in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.</P>
              <P>(c) If the correct withholding and/or Government contributions are not timely submitted to OPM for any reason whatsoever, including cases in which it is finally determined that past service of a current or former employee was subject to the higher deduction and Government contribution rates, the employing agency must correct the error by submitting the correct amounts (including both employee and agency shares) to OPM as soon as possible. Even if the agency waives collection of the overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be available for this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to collect the debt, the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or eligible survivor of a former employee, an employing agency or former employing agency will pay a refund of erroneous additional withholdings for service that is found not to have been covered service. If an individual has paid to OPM a deposit or redeposit, including the additional amount required for covered service, and the deposit is later determined to be erroneous because the service was not covered service, OPM will pay the refund, upon proper application, to the individual, without interest.</P>
              <P>(e) The additional employee withholding and agency contributions for covered service properly made are not separately refundable, even in the event that the employee or his or her survivor does not qualify for a special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 8415(d).</P>
              <P>(f) While an employee who does not hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to such a position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will not be made.</P>

              <P>(g) While an employee who holds a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a position that is not a primary or secondary position, the additional <PRTPAGE P="352"/>withholdings and agency contributions will continue to be made.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Mandatory separation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Effective on and after October 17, 1999, the mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8425 apply to all nuclear materials couriers including those in secondary positions. A mandatory separation under 5 U.S.C. 8425 is not an adverse action under part 752 of this chapter or a removal action under part 359 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) Exemptions from mandatory separation are subject to the conditions set forth under 5 U.S.C. 8425. An exemption may be granted at the sole discretion of the head of the employing agency or by the President in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8425(c).</P>
              <P>(c) In the event that an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 U.S.C. 8425, or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8412 (d) or (e), and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service required for entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position that did not meet the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the conditions set forth in this subpart or, if applicable, in part 831 of this chapter, such separation will be considered erroneous.</P>

              <P>(a) The final decision of the Department of Energy issued to an employee, former employee, or survivor as the result of a request for determination filed under § 842.906; and</P>
              <P>(b) The final decision of the Department of Energy that a break in service referred to in § 842.904(a)(2) did not begin with an involuntary separation within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8414(b)(1)(A).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Oversight of coverage determinations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Upon deciding that a position is a nuclear materials courier position, the agency head must notify OPM (Attention: Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance) stating the title of each position, the number of incumbents, and whether the position is primary or secondary. The Director of OPM retains the authority to revoke the agency head's determination that a position is a primary or secondary position, or that an individual's service in any other position is creditable under 5 U.S.C. 8412(d).</P>
              <P>(b) The Department of Energy must establish a file containing each coverage determination made by the agency head under § 842.903 and § 842.904, and all background material used in making the determination.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon request by OPM, the Department of Energy will make available the entire coverage determination file for OPM to audit to ensure compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon request by OPM, the Department of Energy must submit to OPM a list of all covered positions and any other pertinent information requested.</P>

              <P>(a) The agency head's determination under § 842.1003(a) that a position is a primary position must be based solely on the official position description of the position in question, and any other official description of duties and qualifications. The official documentation for the position must establish that it satisfies the requirements defined in § 842.1002.</P>
              <P>(b) A determination under § 842.1003(b) must be based on the official position description and any other evidence deemed appropriate by the agency head for making the determination.</P>
              <P>(c) If an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. 8422(a)(3), and the employee does not, within 6 months of entering the position formally and in writing seek a determination from the employing agency that his or her service is properly covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is presumed to be correct. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withholding and contributions.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) During service covered under the conditions established by § 842.1003(a) or (c), the Department of Homeland Security will deduct and withhold from the employee's base pay the amounts required under 5 U.S.C. 8422(a) and submit that amount to OPM in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.<PRTPAGE P="355"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) During service described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Department of Homeland Security must submit to OPM the Government contributions required under 5 U.S.C. 8423(a) in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.</P>
              <P>(c) If the correct withholdings and/or Government contributions are not timely submitted to OPM for any reason whatsoever, including cases in which it is finally determined that past service of a current or former employee was subject to the higher deduction and Government contribution rates, the Department of Homeland Security must correct the error by submitting the correct amounts (including both employee and agency shares) to OPM as soon as possible. Even if the Department of Homeland Security waives collection of the overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be available for this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to collect the debt, the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or eligible survivor of a former employee, the Department of Homeland Security will pay a refund of erroneous additional withholdings for service that is found not to have been covered service. If an individual has paid to OPM a deposit or redeposit, including the additional amount required for covered service, and the deposit is later determined to be erroneous because the service was not covered service, OPM will pay the refund, upon proper application, to the individual, without interest.</P>
              <P>(e) The additional employee withholding and agency contributions for covered service properly made are not separately refundable, even in the event that the employee or his or her survivor does not qualify for a special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 8415(d).</P>
              <P>(f) While an employee who does not hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to such a position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will not be made.</P>
              <P>(g) While an employee who holds a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a position that is not a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will continue to be made.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 842.1006</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Mandatory separation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8425 apply to customs and border protection officers, including those in secondary positions. A mandatory separation under 5 U.S.C. 8425 is not an adverse action under part 752 of this chapter or a removal action under part 359 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) Exemptions from mandatory separation are subject to the conditions set forth under 5 U.S.C. 8425. An exemption may be granted at the sole discretion of the head of the employing agency or by the President in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8425(c).</P>
              <P>(c) In the event that an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 U.S.C. 8425, or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8412(d) or (e), and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service required for entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position that did not meet the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the conditions set forth in this subpart or, if applicable, in part 831 of this chapter, such separation will be considered erroneous.</P>
              <P>(d) The customs and border protection officer mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8425 do not apply to an individual first appointed as a customs and border protection officer before July 6, 2008.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Review of decisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The final decision of the agency head denying an individual's request for approval of a position as a primary or secondary customs and border protection officer position made under § 842.1003(a) may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.</P>

              <P>(b) The final decision of the agency head denying an individual coverage while serving in an approved secondary position because of failure to meet the conditions in § 842.1003(b) may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection <PRTPAGE P="356"/>Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Oversight of coverage determinations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Upon deciding that a position is a customs and border protection officer, the Department of Homeland Security must notify OPM (Attention: Associate Director, Retirement Services, or such other official as may be designated) stating the title of each position, the occupational series of the position, the number of incumbents, whether the position is primary or secondary, and, if the position is a primary position, the established maximum entry age, if one has been established. The Director of OPM retains the authority to revoke the agency head's determination that a position is a primary or secondary position.</P>
              <P>(b) The Department of Homeland Security must establish and maintain a file containing all coverage determinations made by the agency head under § 842.1003(a) and (b), and all background material used in making the determination.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon request by OPM, the Department of Homeland Security will make available the entire coverage determination file for OPM to audit to ensure compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon request by OPM, the Department of Homeland Security must submit to OPM a list of all covered positions and any other pertinent information requested.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Election of coverage.</E> (1) The Department of Homeland Security must provide an individual who is a customs and border protection officer on December 26, 2007, with the opportunity to elect not to be treated as a customs and border protection officer under section 535(a) and (b) of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2008, Public Law 110-161, 121 Stat. 2042.</P>
              <P>(2) An election under this paragraph is valid only if made on or before June 22, 2008.</P>
              <P>(3) An individual eligible to make an election under this paragraph who fails to make such an election on or before June 22, 2008, is deemed to have elected to be treated as a customs and border protection officer for retirement purposes.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exclusion from coverage.</E> The provisions of this subpart and any other specific reference to customs and border protection officers in this part do not apply to employees who on December 25, 2007, were law enforcement officers, under subpart H of this part or subpart I of part 831, within U.S. Customs and Border Protection. These employees cannot elect to be treated as a customs and border protection officer under paragraph (a) of this section, nor can they be deemed to have made such an election.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Proportional annuity computation.</E> The annuity of an employee serving in a primary or secondary customs and border protection officer position on July 6, 2008, must, to the extent that its computation is based on service rendered as a customs and border protection officer on or after that date, be at least equal to the amount that would be payable—</P>
              <P>(1) To the extent that such service is subject to the Civil Service Retirement System, by applying section 8339(d) of title 5, United States Code, with respect to such service; and</P>
              <P>(2) To the extent such service is subject to the Federal Employees' Retirement System, by applying section 8415(d) of title 5, United States Code, with respect to such service.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) In the case of a current spouse entitled to an annuity based on the service of a disability annuitant who died after attaining age 62, the amount of the current spouse annuity is one-half of the amount of the annuity to which such disability annuitant was entitled as computed under part 844 of this chapter (including any appropriate reduction under § 844.302(b)(2) or (c)(2) of this chapter, and any adjustments under section 8462 of title 5, United States Code) as of the day before the date of the disability annuitant's death.</P>

However, in determining the amount under § 844.303(a) of this chapter, creditable service includes the period of time between the date of death and the date of the 62nd anniversary of the birth of the annuitant, but average pay is adjusted (under section 8462 of title 5, United States Code) only through date of death.</P>

              <P>(b) The amount of the supplementary annuity under this section equals the lesser of—</P>

              <P>(2) The amount equal to the widow's or widower's insurance benefits that would be payable to him or her under title II of the Social Security Act (without regard to section 202(f)(2) of the Act) based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant, except that for purposes of this calculation—</P>
              <P>(i) The social security earnings test (section 203 of the Act) does not apply; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The benefit is computed—</P>
              <P>(A) As of the date on which the retiree dies; and</P>
              <P>(B) As if the survivor had attained age 60 and made application for those benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of section 202 of the Act; and</P>

              </P>
              <P>(A) For years of service under FERS, only the retiree's basic pay is considered to be wages; and</P>

              <P>(c)(1) The supplementary annuity terminates at the beginning of the month in which the survivor first satisfies the minimum age requirement under section 202(e)(1)(B)(i) or 202(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Social Security Act.</P>
              <P>(2) The supplementary annuity is not payable to a survivor—</P>
              <P>(i) Who would not be entitled to benefits under section 202 (e) or (f) of the Social Security Act based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant (determined, as of the date of the annuitant's death, as if the survivor had attained age 60 and made appropriate application for benefits, but without regard to any restriction relating to remarriage); or</P>
              <P>(ii) For any calendar month in which the survivor is entitled (or would, on proper application, be entitled) to benefits under section 202(g) of the Social Security Act (relating to mother's and father's insurance benefits), or under section 202 (e) or (f) of the Act by reason of having become disabled, based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant.</P>
              <P>(d) For purposes of this section—</P>
              <P>(1) “Assumed CSRS annuity,” as used in the case of a survivor, means the amount of the annuity to which such survivor would be entitled under CSRS based on the service of the deceased annuitant, which is determined—</P>

              <P>(ii) As if the survivor had made appropriate application therefor; and</P>
              <P>(iii) As if the service of the deceased annuitant were creditable under CSRS.</P>
              <P>(2) “Basic pay” means “basic pay” as defined in section 8401 of title 5, United States Code.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(4) A recognized natural child for whom a judicial determination of support was obtained; or</P>

              <P>(b) An annuity under this subpart terminates on the last day of the month before the child—</P>
              <P>(1) Becomes 18 years of age unless he or she is a student as described in § 843.410 or is incapable of self-support;</P>
              <P>(2) Becomes capable of self-support after becoming 18 years of age unless he or she is a student as described in § 843.410;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Annuity for a child age 18 to 22 during full-time school attendance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements for an annuity.</E> (1) For a child age 18 to 22 to be eligible to receive an annuity as a full-time student, the child must also meet all other requirements applicable to qualify for an annuity by a child who has not attained age 18.</P>
              <P>(2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, OPM must receive certification, in a form prescribed by OPM, that the child is regularly pursuing a full-time course of study in an accredited institution.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Full-time course of study.</E> (1) Generally, a full-time course of study is a noncorrespondence course which, if successfully completed, will lead to completion of the education within the period generally accepted as minimum for completion, by a full-time day student, of the academic or training program concerned.</P>
              <P>(2) A certification by an accredited institution that the student's workload is sufficient to constitute a full-time course of study for the program in which the student is enrolled is prima facie evidence that the student is pursuing a full-time course of study.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Certification of school attendance.</E> (1) OPM may periodically request the recipient of a child's annuity payments to furnish certification of school attendance. The certification must be completed in the form prescribed by OPM.</P>
              <P>(2) If OPM requests the recipient of a child's annuity payments to provide a self-certification of school attendance, the recipient must complete and sign the certification form.</P>
              <P>(3) If OPM requests the recipient of a child's annuity payments to provide a certification by the school, the certification must be signed by an official who is either in charge of the school or in charge of the school's records. OPM will not accept certification forms signed by instructors, counselors, aides, roommates, or others not in charge of the school or the records.</P>
              <P>(i) If the educational institution is above the high school level, the certification must be signed by the president or chancellor, vice president or vice chancellor, dean or assistant dean, registrar or administrator, assistant registrar or assistant administrator, or the equivalent.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the educational institution is at the high school level, the certification must be signed by the superintendent of schools, assistant superintendent of schools, principal, vice principal, assistant principal, or the equivalent.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the educational institution is a technical or trade school, the certification must be signed by the president, vice president, director, assistant director, or the equivalent.</P>
              <P>(4) OPM will accept a facsimile signature of a school official only if it is accompanied by a raised seal of the institution or other evidence clearly demonstrating the authenticity of the certification and making unauthorized use of the signature stamp unlikely.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Continuation of annuity during interim breaks.</E> A child's annuity continues during interim breaks between school years if the following conditions are satisfied:</P>
              <P>(1) The student must have been a full-time student at the end of the school term immediately before the break.</P>
              <P>(2) The break between the end of the last term of full-time attendance and the return to full-time attendance must not exceed 5 months. (See § 841.109 of this chapter, concerning calculation of this time period.)</P>

              <P>(3) The recipient of a child's annuity payments must show that the student <PRTPAGE P="371"/>has a bona fide intent to return to school as a full-time student immediately after the break. The full-time certification for the period term and the certification (in a form prescribed by OPM) by the recipient of a child's annuity payments that the student intends to return to school (immediately after the break) as a full-time student constitute prima facie evidence of a bona fide intent to return to school.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Benefits after age 22.</E> (1) A student's eligibility for a child's annuity terminates based on reaching age 22 on—</P>
              <P>(i) June 30 of the calendar year of the child's 22nd birthday if the child's birthday is before July 1; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The last day of the month before the child's 22nd birthday if the child's birthday occurs after June 30 but before September 1 of the calendar year; or</P>
              <P>(iii) June 30 of the year after the one in which the child attains age 22 if the child's birthday is after August 31 of the calendar year.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) An otherwise eligible child who becomes a full-time student after his or her 22nd birthday but before the date the annuity terminates under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is eligible for annuity while he or she is a full-time student until the termination date under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) An otherwise eligible child who is a full-time student, and whose parent dies after the child's 22nd birthday but before the date the annuity terminates under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is eligible for annuity while he or she is a full-time student after the death of the parent until the termination date under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Disabled</E> and <E T="03">disability</E> means unable or inability, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's current position.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Military reserve technician</E> has the same meaning given this term in 5 U.S.C. 8401(30).</P>

In the case of an employee of the United States Postal Service, a vacant position does not include a position in a different craft or a position to which reassignment would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement covering the employee.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) Paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section do not apply to a military reserve technician who retires under 5 U.S.C. 8456.</P>
              <P>(2) An individual who separates from employment as a military reserve technician under circumstances set forth in 5 U.S.C. 8456(a)(1) after reaching age 50 and completing 25 years of service is not entitled to a disability annuity under this part, but is entitled to an annuity under § 842.210 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, an application for disability retirement is timely only if it is filed with the employing agency before the employee or Member separates from service, or with the former employing agency or OPM within 1 year thereafter.</P>
              <P>(2) An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM, an employing agency or former employing agency by personal delivery is considered filed on the date on which OPM, the employing agency or former employing agency receives it. The date of filing by facsimile is the date of the facsimile. The date of filing by mail is determined by the postmark date; if no legible postmark date appears on the mailing, the application is presumed to have been mailed 5 days before its receipt, excluding days on which OPM, the employing agency or former employing agency, as appropriate, is closed for business. The date of filing by commercial overnight delivery is the date the application is given to the overnight delivery service.</P>
              <P>(3) An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM or the applicant's former employing agency within 1 year after the employee's separation, and that is incompletely executed or submitted in a letter or other form not prescribed by OPM, is deemed timely filed. OPM will not adjudicate the application or make payment until the application is filed on a form prescribed by OPM.</P>
              <P>(4) OPM may waive the 1-year time limit if the employee or Member is mentally incompetent on the date of separation or within 1 year thereafter, in which case the individual or his or her representative must file the application with the former employing agency or OPM within 1 year after the date the individual regains competency or a court appoints a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Before payment of a disability annuity under this part can be authorized, the applicant must provide OPM with:</P>
              <P>(i) Satisfactory evidence that the applicant has filed an application for disability insurance benefits under section 223 of the Social Security Act; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An official statement from the Social Security Administration that the individual is not insured for disability insurance benefits as defined in section 223(c)(1) of the Social Security Act.</P>
              <P>(2) A disability retirement application under this part will be dismissed when OPM is notified by the Social Security Administration that the application referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section has been withdrawn. All rights to an annuity under this part terminate upon withdrawal of an application for social security disability benefits.</P>

              <P>(c) An agency may consider the existence of a pending disability retirement application when deciding whether and when to take other personnel actions. An employee's filing for disability retirement does not require the agency <PRTPAGE P="375"/>to delay any appropriate personnel action.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Agency-filed disability retirement applications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for filing an application for an employee.</E> An agency must file an application for disability retirement of an employee who has 18 months of Federal civilian service when all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The agency has issued a decision to remove the employee;</P>
              <P>(2) The agency concludes, after its review of medical documentation, that the cause for unacceptable performance, attendance, or conduct is disease or injury;</P>
              <P>(3) The employee is institutionalized, or the agency concludes, based on a review of medical and other information, that the employee is incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability retirement;</P>
              <P>(4) The employee has no personal representative or guardian; and</P>
              <P>(5) The employee has no immediate family member who is willing to file an application on his or her behalf.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency procedures.</E> (1) When an agency issues a decision to remove an employee and not all of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section have been satisfied, but the removal is based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the agency must advise the employee in writing of his or her possible eligibility for disability retirement and of the time limit for filing an application.</P>
              <P>(2) If all of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section have been met, the agency must inform the employee in writing at the same time it informs the employee of its removal decision, or at any time before the separation is effected, that:</P>
              <P>(i) The agency is submitting a disability retirement application on the employee's behalf to OPM;</P>
              <P>(ii) The employee may review any medical information in accordance with § 294.106(d) of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The action does not affect the employee's right to submit a voluntary application for disability retirement or any other retirement benefit to which the employee is entitled under FERS.</P>
              <P>(3) When an agency submits an application for disability retirement to OPM on behalf of an employee, it must provide OPM with copies of the decision to remove the employee, the medical documentation, and any other documents needed to show that the cause for removal results from a medical condition. Following separation, the agency must provide OPM with a copy of the documentation of the separation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">OPM procedures.</E> (1) OPM will not act on any application for disability retirement filed by an agency on behalf of an employee until it receives the appropriate documentation of the separation. When OPM receives a complete application for disability retirement under this section, it will notify the former employee that it has received the application and that he or she may submit medical documentation. OPM will determine entitlement to disability benefits under § 844.203.</P>
              <P>(2) OPM will cancel any disability retirement when a final decision of an administrative authority or court reverses the removal action and orders the reinstatement of an employee to the agency rolls.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 844.203</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Supporting documentation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An individual or agency filing an application for disability retirement is responsible for providing OPM with the evidence described in § 844.201(b)(1), as well as whatever documentation OPM requires in order to determine whether the individual meets the eligibility requirements set forth in § 844.103. The documentation must be provided in a form prescribed by OPM. Failure to submit the documentation required is grounds for dismissing the application. It is also the responsibility of the disability annuitant to obtain and submit evidence OPM requires to show continuing entitlement to disability benefits. Unless OPM orders an examination by a physician of its choice under paragraph (b) of this section, the cost of providing medical documentation rests with the applicant or disability annuitant.</P>

              <P>(b) OPM may offer the applicant a medical examination when it determines that an independent evaluation <PRTPAGE P="376"/>of medical evidence is needed in order to make a decision regarding an application for a disability annuity or a disability annuitant's entitlement to continuing benefits. The medical examination will be conducted by a medical officer of the United States or a qualified physician or board of physicians designated by OPM. The applicant's refusal to submit to an examination is grounds for dismissal of the application or termination of payments to an annuitant.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) OPM will review the documentation submitted under paragraph (a) of this section to determine whether the individual has met the eligibility requirements set forth in § 844.103. OPM will issue its decision in writing to the individual and to the employing agency. The decision will include a statement of OPM's findings and conclusions and an explanation of the applicant's right to request reconsideration or MSPB review under § 844.104.</P>
              <P>(2) OPM may rescind a decision to allow an application for disability retirement at any time if OPM determines that the original decision was erroneous due to fraud, misstatement of fact, or upon the acquisition of additional medical or other documentation. OPM will provide the individual and the employing agency with written notification of the rescission, including a statement of OPM's findings and conclusions and an explanation of the individual's right to request reconsideration or MSPB review under § 844.104.</P>
              <P>(d) Subject to 5 U.S.C. 552a, any supporting documentation provided to OPM under this section may be shared with the Social Security Administration and the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs of the U.S. Department of Labor.</P>

              <P>(b) A disability annuitant may request medical reevaluation under the provisions of this section at any time. OPM may reevaluate the medical condition of disability annuitants age 60 or over only on their own request.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Recovery based on medical or other documentation.</E> When OPM determines on the basis of medical documentation or other evidence that a disability annuitant has recovered from the disability, OPM will terminate the annuity effective on the first day of the month beginning 1 year after the date of the medical documentation or other evidence showing recovery. If an agency reemploys a disability annuitant who has been found recovered at any grade or rate of pay within the 1-year period pending termination of the disability annuity under this paragraph, OPM will terminate the annuity effective on the date of reemployment.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Recovery based on reemployment by the Federal Government.</E> Reemployment by an agency at any time before age 60 is evidence of recovery if the reemployment is under an appointment not limited to a year or less, at the same or higher grade or pay level as the position from which the disability annuitant retired. The new position must be full-time unless the position the disability annuitant occupied immediately before retirement was less than full-time, in which case the new position must have a work schedule of no less time than that of the position from which the disability annuitant retired. In this instance, OPM needs no <PRTPAGE P="378"/>medical documentation to find the annuitant recovered. Disability annuity payments will terminate effective on the first day of the month following the month in which the recovery finding is made under this paragraph.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Restoration of earning capacity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Earning capacity determinations.</E> If a disability annuitant is under age 60 on December 31 of any calendar year and his or her income from wages or self-employment or both during that calendar year equals at least 80 percent of the current rate of basic pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement, the annuitant's earning capacity is considered to be restored. The disability annuity will terminate on the June 30 after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is restored.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Current rate of basic pay for the position occupied immediately before retirement.</E> (1) A disability annuitant's income for a calendar year is compared to the gross annual rate of basic pay in effect on December 31 of that year for the position occupied immediately before retirement. The income limitation for most disability annuitants is based on the rate for the grade and step that reflects the total amount of basic pay (both the grade and step and any additional basic pay) in effect on the date of separation from the agency for disability retirement. Additional basic pay is included subject to the premium pay restrictions of 5 U.S.C. 5545 (c)(1) and (c)(2).</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of an annuitant whose basic pay rate on the date determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section did not match a specific grade and step in the pay schedule:</P>
              <P>(i) For those retiring from a Senior Executive Service position, a merit pay position, a position for which a special pay rate is authorized (except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section), or any other position in which the rate of basic pay is not equal to a grade and step in a pay schedule, the grade and step will be established for this purpose at the lowest step in the pay schedule grade that is equal to or greater than the actual rate of basic pay payable.</P>
              <P>(ii) For those retiring with a retained rate of basic pay or from a position for which a special pay rate is in effect but whose rate of basic pay exceeds the highest rate payable in the pay schedule grade applicable to the position held, the grade is established for this purpose at the highest grade in the schedule that is closest to the grade of the position held and within which the amount of the retained pay falls. The step is established for this purpose at the lowest step in that grade that equals or exceeds the actual rate of pay payable.</P>
              <P>(3) For annuitants retiring from the United States Postal Service, only cost-of-living allowances subject to FERS deductions are included in determining the current rate of basic pay of the position held at retirement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Income.</E> (1) Earning capacity for the purposes of this section is demonstrated by an annuitant's ability to earn post-retirement income in exchange for personal services or a work product, or as a profit from one or more businesses wholly or partly owned by the disability annuitant and in the management of which the annuitant has an active role. Income for the purposes of this section is not necessarily the same as income for the purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.</P>
              <P>(2) Income earned from one source is not offset by losses from another source. Income earned as wages is not reduced by a net loss from self-employment. The net income from each self-employment endeavor is calculated separately, and the income earned as net earnings from one self-employment endeavor is not reduced by a net loss from another self-employment endeavor. Thus, a net loss from one endeavor is considered to be a net income of zero, and the net incomes from each separate self-employment endeavor are added together to determine the total amount of income from self-employment for a calendar year.</P>
              <P>(3) Income is counted in the calendar year in which it is earned, even though receipt may be deferred.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Requirement to report income.</E> All disability annuitants who, on December 31 of any calendar year, are under age 60 must report to OPM their income from wages or self-employment <PRTPAGE P="379"/>or both for that calendar year. Each year as early as possible, OPM will send a form to annuitants to use in reporting their income from the previous calendar year. The form specifies the date by which OPM must receive the report. OPM will determine entitlement to continued annuity on the basis of the report. If an annuitant fails to submit the report, OPM may stop annuity payments until it receives the report.</P>

              <P>(a) When a disability annuity is terminated because of recovery or restoration of earning capacity and the individual is not employed in the Government, the individual is entitled to an annuity:</P>
              <P>(1) Under 5 U.S.C. 8414(b) if the individual:</P>
              <P>(i) Is at least age 50 when the disability annuity ceases and had 20 or more years of service at the time of retiring for disability; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Has 25 or more years of service at the time of retiring for disability, regardless of age; or</P>
              <P>(2) Under 5 U.S.C. 8412(g) if the individual is at least the minimum retirement age applicable under 5 U.S.C. 8412(h) when the disability annuity ceases and had 10 or more years of service at the time of retiring for disability.</P>
              <P>(b) When a disability annuitant whose annuity was terminated because of Federal reemployment is separated and meets the age and service requirements for immediate retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8412 or 8414, the individual is entitled to an annuity computed under 5 U.S.C. 8415.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reinstatement of disability annuity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When a disability annuity stops, the individual must again prove that he or she meets the eligibility requirements in order to have the annuity reinstated.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reinstatement of annuity terminated based on recovery.</E> (1) When a recovered disability annuitant under age 62 whose annuity was terminated because he or she was found recovered on the basis of medical evidence (§ 844.401) is not reemployed in a position subject to FERS, and, based on the results of a current medical examination, OPM finds that the disability has recurred, OPM will reinstate the disability annuity as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. The right to the reinstated annuity begins on the date of the medical documentation showing that the disability has recurred, or if the medical documentation clearly shows that the disability recurred on an earlier date, the annuity will be reinstated on that earlier date.</P>
              <P>(2) Except in the case of an individual receiving an annuity under § 844.404(b), OPM will, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, reinstate the disability annuity of a former annuitant whose annuity was terminated because he or she was found recovered on the basis of Federal reemployment when:</P>
              <P>(i) The results of a current medical examination show that the individual's medical condition has worsened since the finding of recovery and that the original disability on which retirement was based has recurred; and</P>
              <P>(ii) As a result, he or she has been:</P>
              <P>(A) Separated and not reemployed in a position subject to FERS; or</P>
              <P>(B) Placed in a position that results in a reduction in grade or pay below that from which the individual retired, or in a change to a temporary or intermittent appointment. The right to the reinstated annuity begins on the date the reemployment ends or the effective date of the placement in the position that results in a reduction in grade or pay or change in appointment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reinstatement of annuity terminated because earning capacity was restored.</E> (1) OPM will reinstate the disability annuity as provided in paragraph (d) of this section when a disability annuitant whose annuity was terminated under § 844.402(a):</P>
              <P>(i) Is not reemployed in a position subject to FERS;</P>
              <P>(ii) Has not recovered from the disability for which the individual retired (except in the case of a military reserve technician whose annuity was awarded under 5 U.S.C. 8456); and</P>

              <P>(iii) Again loses earning capacity, as determined by OPM.<PRTPAGE P="380"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The reinstated annuity is payable from January 1 of the year following the calendar year in which earning capacity was lost. Earning capacity is lost if, during any calendar year, the individual's income from wages or self-employment or both is less than 80 percent of the current rate of basic pay of the position held at retirement.</P>
              <P>(d) Except as provided in §§ 844.303 and 844.304, a disability annuity reinstated under the preceding paragraphs of this section is paid at the rate provided under § 844.302(b) until the end of the 12th month beginning after the annuity is reinstated. Thereafter, the rate determined under § 844.302(c) is payable until age 62.</P>
              <P>(e) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, an annuity may not be reinstated under this section if the individual is receiving an annuity under part 842 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(1) Collection would be against equity and good conscience under the standards prescribed in §§ 845.303 through 845.305; or</P>

              <P>(i) The debtor establishes that he or she is financially unable to pay in one lump sum; or</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) The benefit payable is insufficient to make collection in one lump sum;</P>

When offset begins without completion of the administrative review process, these procedures will be completed promptly, and amounts recovered by offset but later found not owed will be refunded promptly.</P>
              <P>(2) The procedures identified in § 845.204 will not be applied when the debt is caused by a retroactive adjustment in the periodic rate of annuity or any deduction taken from annuity when the adjustment is a result of the annuitant's election of different entitlements under law, if the adjustment is made within 120 days of the effective date of the election; or interim estimated payments made before the formal determination of entitlement to annuity, if the amount is recouped from the total annuity payable on the first day of the month following the last advance payment or the date the formal determination is made, whichever is later.</P>

              <P>(ii) In determining whether to collect claims by means of administrative offset after the expiration of the 6-year limitation provided in 5 U.S.C. 2415, the Director or his or her designee will determine the cost effectiveness of leaving a claim unresolved for more than 6 years. This decision will be based on such factors as the amount of the debt, the cost of collection, and the likelihood of recovering the debt.</P>

The questions of fact and liability, and entitlements to waiver or compromise determined through that process are deemed correct and will not be amended under salary offset procedures.

              <P>A recipient of an overpayment is without fault if he or she performed no act of commission or omission that resulted in the overpayment.

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Creditor agencies that are the debtor's paying agency.</E> Ordinarily, debts owed the paying agency should be offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 from any final payments (salary, accrued annual leave, etc.) due the debtor.

              <P>(ii) If the debtor does not respond to the creditor agency's notice within the allotted time and there is no reason to believe that he or she did not receive the notice, the creditor agency may submit the debt claim to OPM after certifying that notice was issued and the debtor failed to reply.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the debtor responds to the notice by requesting a review (or hearing if one is available), the review (or hearing) must be completed before the creditor agency submits the debt claim.</P>

              <P>(6) <E T="03">Notice of debt.</E> When a creditor agency cannot send a complete debt claim, it should notify OPM of the existence of the debt so that the lump-sum will not be paid before the debt claim arrives.</P>
              <P>(i) The notice to OPM must include a statement that the debt is owed to the United States, the date the debt first accrued, and the basis for and amount of the debt, if known.

              <P>(ii) The creditor agency may either notify OPM by making a notation in column 8 [Remarks] under “Fiscal Record” on the Individual Retirement Record, if the Individual Retirement Record is in its possession, or if not, by submitting a separate document identifying the debtor by name, giving his or her date of birth, social security number, and date of separation, if known.</P>

Generally, however, agencies must file a debt claim before the statute of limitations expires (4 CFR 102.4(c)) or before a refund is paid. Time limits are imposed (see § 845.406(a)) when the debtor is eligible for a refund and OPM receives his or her application requesting payment. In this situation, creditor agencies must file a complete debt claim within 120 days (or 180 days if the agency requests an extension of time before the refund is paid) of the date OPM requests a complete debt claim.</P>

              <SUBJECT>OPM processing for non-fraud claims.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Refunds—incomplete debt claims.</E> (1) If a creditor agency sends OPM a notice of debt claim against a refund OPM is processing for payment, OPM will withhold the amount of the debt but will not make any payment to the creditor agency. OPM will notify the creditor agency that the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be completed; and a debt claim must be completed and returned to OPM within 120 days of the date of OPM's notice to the creditor agency. Upon request, OPM will grant the creditor agency one extension of up to 60 days if the request for extension is received before the lump-sum payment has been made. The extension will commence on the day after the 120-day period expires so that the total time OPM holds payment of the refund will not exceed 180 days.</P>
              <P>(2) During the period allotted the creditor agency for sending OPM a complete debt claim, OPM will handle the debtor's application for refund under section 8424 of title 5, United States Code, in one of two ways:</P>
              <P>(i) If the amount of the debt is known, OPM will notify the debtor of the debt claim against his or her lump-sum credit, withhold the amount of the debt, and pay the balance to the debtor, if any.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the amount of the debt is not known, OPM will not pay any amount to the debtor until the creditor agency certifies the amount of the debt, submits a complete debt claim, or the <PRTPAGE P="389"/>time limit for submission of the debt claim expires, whichever comes first.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Refunds—complete debt claims</E>—(1) <E T="03">OPM receives an application from the debtor prior to or at the same time as the agency's debt claim.</E> (i) If a refund has been paid, OPM will notify the creditor agency there are no funds available for offset. Except in the case of debts due because of the employee's failure to pay health benefits premiums while he or she is in nonpay status or while his or her salary was not sufficient to cover the cost of premiums, creditor agencies should refer to the instructions in the FCCS for other measures to recover the outstanding debt; however, OPM will retain the debt claim on file in the event the debtor is once again employed in a position subject to retirement deductions.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a refund is payable and the creditor agency submits a complete debt claim in accordance with § 845.405(b) (1), (2), (3), or (4), the debt will be collected from the refund and any balance paid to the debtor. OPM will send the debtor a copy of the debt claim, judgment, consent, or other document, and notify him or her that the creditor agency was paid.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">If OPM has not received an application from the debtor when the agency's debt claim is received.</E> If a debtor has not filed application for a refund, OPM will retain the debt claim for future recovery. OPM will make the collection whenever an application is received, provided the creditor agency initiated the administrative offset before the statute of limitations expired. (See 4 CFR 102.3(b)(3) and 102.4(c).) OPM will notify the creditor agency that it does not have an application from the debtor so that the agency may take other action to recover the debt.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>If the recovery action is successful, the creditor agency must notify OPM so it can void the debt claim.</P>
              </NOTE>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Future recovery.</E> (i) If OPM receives an application for refund within 1 year of the date the agency's debt claim was received and the creditor agency does not indicate that interest is accruing on the debt, the debt will be processed as stated in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If OPM receives an application for refund within 1 year of the date the agency's debt claim was received and the creditor agency indicates that interest accrues on the debt, when necessary, OPM will contact the creditor agency to confirm that the debt is outstanding and request submission in writing, of the total additional accrued interest. OPM will not make interest computations for creditor agencies.</P>
              <P>(iii) When OPM receives an application for refund more than 1 year after the creditor agency's debt claim was received, whether interest accrues or not, OPM will contact the creditor agency to see if the debt is still outstanding and, when necessary, request an update of the interest charges. If the debt is still due, the creditor agency must give the debtor an opportunity to establish that his or her changed financial circumstances, if any, would make the offset unjust. (See 4 CFR 102.4(c).) If the creditor agency determines that offset as requested in the debt claim would be unjust because of the debtor's changed financial circumstances, the agency should permit the debtor to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset. If the agency decides to pursue the offset, it must submit to OPM the requested information and any new instructions within 60 days of the date of OPM's request or the claim may be voided and the balance paid to the individual.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Annuities—incomplete debt claims.</E> (1) If a creditor agency sends OPM notice of a debt or an incomplete debt claim against a debtor who is receiving an annuity, OPM will not offset the annuity. OPM will notify the creditor agency that—</P>
              <P>(i) The procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be completed; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A debt claim must be completed and sent to OPM.</P>
              <P>(2) No time limit will be given for the submission of a debt claim against an annuity; however, a debt claim must be received within 10 years of the date the Government's right to collect first accrued (4 CFR 102.3(b)(3)).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Annuities—complete debt claims</E>—(1) <E T="03">General</E>—(i) <E T="03">Notice.</E> When OPM receives a complete debt claim and an application for annuity, OPM will offset the annuity, pay the creditor agency, and mail the debtor a copy of the debt <PRTPAGE P="390"/>claim along with notice of the payment to the creditor agency.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Beginning deductions.</E> If OPM already established the debtor's annuity payment, deductions will begin with the next available annuity payment. If OPM is in the process of establishing the annuity payments, deductions will not be taken from advance annuity payments, but will begin with the annuity payable on the first day of the month following the last advance payment.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Updating accrued interest.</E> Once OPM has completed a collection, if there are additional accrued interest charges, the creditor agency must contact OPM regarding any additional amount due within 90 days of the date of the final payment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Claims held for future recovery.</E> (i) If OPM receives an application for annuity within 1 year of the date the agency's debt claim was received, the debt will be processed as stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If OPM receives an application for annuity more than 1 year after the agency's debt claim was submitted, OPM will contact the creditor agency to see if the debt is still outstanding. If the debt is still due, the creditor agency should permit the debtor to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset if the debtor establishes that his or her changed financial circumstances would make the offset unjust. (See 4 CFR 102.4(c).) If the agency decides to pursue the offset, it must submit the requested information and any new instructions about the collection to OPM.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Limitations on OPM review.</E> In no case will OPM review—</P>
              <P>(1) The merits of a creditor agency's decision regarding reconsideration, compromise, or waiver; or</P>
              <P>(2) The creditor agency's decision that a hearing was not required in any particular proceeding.</P>

              <P>(a) When possible, OPM will collect a creditor agency's full claim in one payment from the debtor's refund or annuity.</P>
              <P>(b) If collection must be made from an annuity and the debt is large, the creditor must generally accept payment in installments. The responsibility for establishing and notifying the debtor of the amount of the installments belongs to the creditor agency (see § 845.405(b)(5)). However, OPM will not make an installment deduction for more than 50 percent of net annuity, unless a higher percentage is needed to satisfy a judgment against a debtor within 3 years or the annuitant has consented to the higher amount in writing. All correspondence concerning installment deductions received by OPM will be referred to the creditor agency for consideration.</P>

              <P>When an agency sends a claim indicating fraud, presentation of a false claim, misrepresentation by the debtor or any other party interested in the claim, or any claim based in whole or part on conduct violating the antitrust laws, to the Department of Justice (Justice) for possible treatment as a fraud claim (4 CFR 101.3), the following special procedures apply.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Agency processing.</E> If the debtor is separated or separates while Justice is reviewing the claim, the paying agency must send the Individual Retirement Record to OPM, as required by § 845.405(c)(2). The agency where the claim arose must send OPM notice that a claim is pending with Justice. (See § 845.405(b)(6) for instructions on giving OPM a notice of debt.)</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Department of Justice processing.</E> (1) The Attorney General or a designee will decide whether a debt claim sent in by an agency will be reserved for collection by Justice as a fraud claim. Upon receiving a possible fraud claim to be collected by offset from the Fund, the Attorney General or a designee must notify OPM. The notice to OPM must contain the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The name, date of birth, and social security number of the debtor;</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount of the possible fraud claim, if known;</P>
              <P>(iii) The basis of the possible fraud claim; and</P>

              <P>(iv) A statement that the claim is being considered as a possible fraud claim, the collection of which is reserved to Justice.<PRTPAGE P="391"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) When there is a pending refund application, the Attorney General or designee must file a complaint seeking a judgment on the claim and send a copy of the complaint to OPM; or as provided in 4 CFR 101.3, refer the claim to the agency where the claim arose and submit a copy of the referral to OPM within 180 days of the date of either notice from the agency that a claim is pending with Justice (paragraph (a) of this section) or notice from Justice that it has received a possible fraud claim (paragraph (b)(1) of this section) whichever is earlier. When the claim is referred to the agency where it arose, the agency must begin administrative collection action under 4 CFR 102.4 and send a complete debt claim to OPM as required in § 845.405.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">OPM processing against refunds.</E> (1) Upon receipt of a notice under paragraph (a) or (b)(1) of this section, whichever is earlier, OPM will withhold the amount of the debt claim, if known; notify the debtor that the amount of the debt will be withheld from the refund for at least 180 days from the date of the notice that initiated OPM processing; and pay the balance to the debtor. If the amount of the debt claim is not known, OPM will notify the debtor that a debt claim may be offset against his or her refund and that OPM will not pay any amount until either the amount of the debt claim is established, or the time limit for filing a complaint in court or submitting the debt claim expires, whichever comes first.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Attorney General files a complaint and notifies OPM within the applicable 180-day period, OPM will continue to withhold payment of the lump-sum credit until there is a final judgment.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Attorney General refers the claim to the agency where the claim arose (creditor agency) and notifies OPM within the applicable 180-day period, OPM will notify the creditor agency that (i) the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be completed; and (ii) a debt claim must be sent to OPM within 120 days of the date of OPM's notice to the creditor agency. At the request of the creditor agency, one extension of time of not more than 60 days will be granted, as provided by § 845.406(a).</P>
              <P>(4) If OPM is not notified that a complaint has been filed or that the claim has been referred to the creditor agency within the applicable 180-day period, OPM will pay the balance of the refund to the debtor.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">OPM processing against annuities.</E> If the debtor has filed an annuity claim, OPM will not take action against the annuity. OPM will continue to pay the annuity unless and until there is a final judgment for the United States or submission of a complete debt claim.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">OPM collection and payment of the debt.</E> (1) If the United States obtains a judgment against the debtor for the amount of the debt or the creditor agency submits a complete debt claim, OPM will collect and pay the debt to the creditor agency as provided in §§ 845.406 and 845.407.</P>
              <P>(2) If the suit or the administrative proceeding results in a judgment for the debtor without establishing a debt to the United States, OPM will pay the balance of the refund to the debtor upon receipt of a certified copy of the judgment or administrative decision.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Condition for making an election.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) An election under § 846.102 of this part may not become effective unless the election is made with the written consent of any former spouse(s) entitled to benefits under subpart F of part 831 of this chapter or part 838 of this chapter. As provided in section 301(d)(2)(A) of the FERS Act of 1986, this section applies only if OPM has been duly notified concerning any qualifying court order and has received the documentation required in § 838.211, § 838.721, or § 838.1005 of this chapter. <PRTPAGE P="394"/>This section does not apply with respect to a former spouse who has ceased to be so entitled because of remarrying before age 55.</P>
              <P>(b) OPM may waive the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section upon a showing that the former spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined. A request for waiver on this basis must be accompanied by—</P>
              <P>(1) A judicial or administrative determination that the former spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined; or</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Affidavits by the employee or Member and two other persons, at least one of whom is not related to the employee or Member, attesting to the inability to locate the former spouse and stating the efforts made to locate the spouse; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Documentary corroboration such as newspaper reports about the former spouse's disappearance.</P>
              <P>(c) OPM may waive the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section based on exceptional circumstances if the employee or Member presents a judicial determination regarding the former spouse that would warrant waiver of the consent requirement based on exceptional circumstances.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) OPM shall, upon application of an individual, grant an extension for such individual to make an election under § 846.201 of this part, if the individual—</P>
              <P>(i) Files an application for the extension with OPM before the end of the period during which the individual would otherwise be eligible to make the election; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Demonstrates to OPM's satisfaction that the extension is needed to secure the modification of a decree of divorce or annulment (or court ordered or court-approved property settlement incident to any such decree) on file at OPM in order to satisfy the consent requirement under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The application for extension is deemed to be filed with OPM on the date it is received in the employing office.</P>
              <P>(3) An extension granted under this paragraph expires 6 months after the date it was granted. OPM may grant one further extension upon application by the individual seeking to make an election of FERS coverage.</P>
              <P>(e) An electing individual who has a former spouse who may be entitled to benefits as described in paragraph (a) of this section must submit with the election either—</P>
              <P>(1) The consent of the former spouse in a form prescribed by OPM,</P>
              <P>(2) A request for an extension as described in paragraph (f) of this section,</P>
              <P>(3) A request for a waiver of the consent requirement and the documentation to support the request as described in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, or</P>
              <P>(4) A request for a determination as to whether a qualifying court order as described in paragraph (a) of this section is on file with OPM.</P>
              <P>(f) The request for waiver or extension described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section must be in a form prescribed by OPM. The employing office must forward the request to OPM promptly.</P>
              <P>(g) If OPM does not have a copy of a qualifying court order in its possession, OPM's notice to the agency that it has no qualifying court order is deemed to complete the individual's election of FERS, which becomes effective with the first pay period after the employing office receives OPM's notification.</P>
              <P>(h) If OPM has a copy of a qualifying court order, OPM will notify both the individual and the employing agency of its determination regarding a request for extension.</P>
              <P>(i) If OPM has a copy of a qualifying court order in its possession and grants a waiver of the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, OPM will notify both the individual and the employing office of its decision. OPM's notice to the employing office is deemed to complete the individual's election, which becomes effective with the first pay period after the employing office receives OPM's notice that the waiver is granted.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Belated elections and correction of administrative errors.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Belated elections.</E> On determination by an employing office that the FERS transfer handbook issued by OPM was not available to an individual in a timely manner or an individual was unable, for cause beyond his or her control, to elect FERS coverage within the prescribed time limit, the employing office may, within 6 months after the expiration of the individual's opportunity to elect FERS coverage under § 846.201, accept the individual's election of FERS coverage.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">Correction of administrative errors related to election.</E> During the 6-month period after the expiration of an individual's opportunity to elect FERS coverage under § 846.201, the employing office may make prospective corrections of administrative errors regarding an individual's opportunity to elect FERS coverage, including failure to provide the election form specified in § 846.203(a) to an individual.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) <E T="03">Erroneous FERS coverage for a period of less than 3 years of service.</E> For an employee, separated employee, or retiree whose employing agency erroneously determined that the individual was covered by FERS during the period under § 846.201 when the individual was eligible to elect FERS, and the employing agency should have placed the individual in CSRS, CSRS Offset, or Social Security-Only, under conditions that would have included an opportunity to elect FERS coverage, and the employee, separated employee, or retiree remained in FERS for less than 3 years of service, the employee, separated employee, or retiree is deemed to have elected FERS coverage and the individual will remain covered by FERS, unless the individual declines under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to be covered by FERS.</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) The employing agency must provide written notice to each individual who is deemed to have elected FERS under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section that the individual may, within 60 days after receiving the notice, decline to be deemed to have transferred to FERS.</P>
              <P>(B) If the individual dies during the election period established by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) and (C) of this section, the right of election under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section may be exercised by any person who would be entitled to receive a current spouse survivor annuity or a former spouse survivor annuity under CSRS (or CSRS Offset), if any, if the error had not occurred (the election by any one such current or former spouse not to have the election of FERS coverage deemed is controlling); otherwise, by the individual or individuals entitled to receive the lump-sum credit under CSRS (or CSRS Offset) if the error had not occurred (the election by any individual entitled to a share of the lump-sum credit not to have the election of FERS coverage deemed is controlling). The time limit for making an election under this paragraph is 60 days after the date of the agency's notice to the individual (survivor) of the election right.</P>

              <P>(C) The agency may waive the 60-day time limit under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section if the individual (if living, otherwise the appropriate survivor) exercised due diligence in making the election but was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the election within the time limit.

                <P>(i) SF 3110, Former Spouse's Consent to FERS Election, to document the former spouse's consent to the FERS coverage; or<PRTPAGE P="402"/>

                <P>(2) If the employee states on the SF 3109, the FERS Election of Coverage form, that he or she does not know whether he or she is subject to a qualifying court order, the employee must submit to the employing office a completed SF 3111, Request for Waiver, Extension, or Search, to request OPM to determine whether it has a qualifying court order relating to the employee.</P>

                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Whereabouts cannot be determined.</E> OPM will waive the former spouse consent requirement upon a showing that the former spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined. A request for waiver on this basis must be accompanied by—</P>

                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Exceptional circumstances.</E> OPM will waive the former spouse consent requirement based on exceptional circumstances if the employee presents a judicial determination finding that—</P>
                <P>(A) The case before the court involves a Federal employee who is in the process of electing FERS coverage and the former spouse of that employee;</P>
                <P>(B) The former spouse has been given notice and an opportunity to be heard concerning this proceeding;</P>
                <P>(C) The court has considered sections 301 and 302 of the FERS Act, Pub. L. 99-335, 100 Stat. 517, and this section as they relate to waiver of the former spouse consent requirement for an employee with a former spouse to elect FERS coverage; and</P>

OPM's notice to the employing office is deemed to complete the individual's election, which becomes effective with the first pay period after the employing office receives OPM's notice that the waiver is granted.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Extension of the time limit to obtain a former spouse's consent</E>—(i) <E T="03">First request.</E> If an employee who is ineligible to elect FERS coverage solely because of a qualifying court order files, prior to January 1, 1999, a completed SF 3111, Request for Waiver, Extension or Search, requesting an extension of the time limit to seek an amendment of a qualifying court order, OPM is deemed to have approved the extension through June 30, 1999.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Second request.</E> OPM will grant one extension of the time limit to seek an amendment of a qualifying court order to an individual who has been granted an extension under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section if the individual—</P>
                <P>(A) Files an application for the extension (SF 3109) with the employing office before July 1, 1999;</P>
                <P>(B) Has initiated legal proceedings to secure the modification of the qualifying court order on file at OPM to satisfy the former spouse consent requirement;</P>
                <P>(C) Demonstrates to OPM's satisfaction that the individual has exercised due diligence in seeking to obtain the modification; and</P>
                <P>(D) If seeking an extension beyond December 31, 1999, demonstrates to OPM's satisfaction that a longer extension is necessary.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Expiration date of a second extension.</E> An approved extension under <PRTPAGE P="403"/>paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section expires on December 31, 1999, unless OPM's decision letter states a later expiration date.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Search for a qualifying court order.</E> (i) When an employing office notifies OPM that it has received an employee's request for a determination of whether OPM has a qualifying court order on file, OPM will determine whether it has such an order.</P>
                <P>(ii) If OPM does not have a copy of a qualifying court order in its possession, OPM's notice to the employing office that it has no qualifying court order completes the employee's election of FERS coverage and the election becomes effective at the beginning of the first pay period after the employing office receives OPM's notification.</P>
                <P>(iii) If OPM has a copy of a qualifying court order, OPM will notify both the individual and the employing office that it has a qualifying court order and that an extension until June 30, 1999, has been granted.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Effect of phased retirement.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) A phased retiree is deemed to be a full-time employee for the purpose of 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 and 5 CFR part 890 (related to health benefits), as required by 5 U.S.C. 8412a(i). The normal rules governing health benefits premiums for part-time employees in 5 U.S.C. 8906(b)(3) do not apply.</P>

              <P>(2) A phased retiree is deemed to be receiving basic pay at the rate applicable to a full-time employee holding the same position for the purpose of determining a phased retiree's annual rate of basic pay used in calculating premiums (employee withholdings and agency contributions) and benefits under 5 U.S.C. chapter 87 and 5 CFR part 870 (dealing with life insurance), as required by 5 U.S.C. 8412a(o). The deemed full-time schedule will consist of five 8-hour workdays each workweek, resulting in a 40-hour workweek. Only basic pay for hours within the deemed full-time schedule will be considered, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 8412a(o) and the definition of “full-time” in § 848.102. Any premium pay creditable as basic pay for life insurance purposes under 5 CFR 870.204 for overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule that an employee was receiving before phased retirement, such as standby duty pay under <PRTPAGE P="425"/>5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1) or customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), may not be considered in determining a phased retiree's deemed annual rate of basic pay under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(b) A phased retiree may not be appointed to more than one position at the same time.</P>
              <P>(c) A phased retiree may move to another position in the agency or another agency during phased retirement status only if the change would not result in a change in the working percentage. To move to another agency during phased retirement status and continue phased employment and phased retirement status, the phased retiree must submit a written and signed request and obtain the signed written approval, in accordance with § 848.203(a)(1) and (2), of the authorized agency official to which the phased retiree is moving. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 848.204, if the authorized agency official approves the request, the phased retiree's phased employment and phased retirement status will continue without interruption at the agency to which the phased retiree moves. If the authorized agency official at the agency to which the phased retiree moves does not approve the request, phased employment and phased retirement status terminates in accordance with § 848.302(b).</P>
              <P>(d) A phased retiree may be detailed to another position or agency if the working percentage of the position to which detailed is the same as the working percentage of the phased retiree's position of record.</P>
              <P>(e) A retirement-eligible employee who makes an election under this subpart may not elect an alternative annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8420a.</P>
              <P>(f) If the employee's election of phased retirement status becomes effective, the employee is barred from electing phased retirement status again. Ending phased retirement status or entering full retirement status does not create a new opportunity for the individual to elect phased retirement status.</P>
              <P>(g) With the exception of § 841.803(f), a phased retiree is deemed to be an annuitant for the purpose of subpart H of 5 CFR part 841.</P>

              <P>(j)(1) A phased retiree may not be assigned hours of work in excess of the officially established part-time schedule (reflecting the working percentage), except under the conditions specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) An authorized agency official may order or approve a phased retiree to perform hours of work in excess of the officially established part-time schedule only in rare and exceptional circumstances meeting all of the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) The work is necessary to respond to an emergency posing a significant, immediate, and direct threat to life or property;</P>
              <P>(ii) The authorized agency official determines that no other qualified employee is available to perform the required work;</P>
              <P>(iii) The phased retiree is relieved from performing excess work as soon as reasonably possible (e.g., by management assignment of work to other employees); and</P>
              <P>(iv) When an emergency situation can be anticipated in advance, agency management made advance plans to minimize any necessary excess work by the phased retiree.</P>
              <P>(3) Employing agencies must inform each phased retiree and his or her supervisor of—</P>
              <P>(i) The limitations on hours worked in excess of the officially established part-time schedule;</P>
              <P>(ii) The requirement to maintain records documenting that the exceptions met all required conditions;</P>
              <P>(iii) The fact that, by law and regulation, any basic pay received for hours outside the employee's officially established part-time work schedule (as described in § 848.202(a)(1) and (b)) is subject to retirement deductions and agency contributions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8412a(d), but is not used in computing retirement benefits; and</P>

              <P>(iv) The fact that, by law and regulation, any premium pay received for <PRTPAGE P="426"/>overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule that would otherwise be basic pay for retirement, such as customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), will not be subject to retirement deductions or agency contributions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8412a(d), and that any such premium pay received will not be included in computing retirement benefits.</P>
              <P>(4) Employing agencies must maintain records documenting that exceptions granted under paragraph (j)(2) of this section meet the required conditions. These records must be retained for at least 6 years and be readily available to auditors. OPM may require periodic agency reports on the granting of exceptions and of any audit findings.</P>
              <P>(5) If OPM finds that an agency (or subcomponent) is granting exceptions that are not in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (j), OPM may administratively withdraw the agency's (or subcomponent's) authority to grant exceptions and require OPM approval of any exception.</P>
              <P>(6) If OPM finds that a phased retiree has been working a significant amount of excess hours beyond the officially established part-time schedule to the degree that the intent of the phased retirement law is being undermined, OPM may require that the agency end the individual's phased retirement by unilateral action, notwithstanding the normally established methods of ending phased retirement. This finding does not need to be based on a determination that the granted exceptions failed to meet the required conditions in paragraph (j)(2) of this section. With the ending of an individual's phased retirement, that individual must be returned to regular employment status on the same basis as a person making an election under § 848.301—unless that individual elects to fully retire as provided under § 848.401.</P>
              <P>(7) A phased retiree must be compensated for excess hours of work in accordance with the normally applicable pay rules.</P>
              <P>(8) Any premium pay received for overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule that would otherwise be basic pay for retirement, such as customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), is not subject to retirement deductions or agency contributions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8412a(d).</P>

              <P>(1) The amount computed under § 848.501(a), increased by cost-of-living adjustments under § 848.503(c); and</P>
              <P>(2) The “fully retired phased component” computed under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Subject to the requirements described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, a “fully retired phased component” equals the product obtained by multiplying—</P>

              <P>(ii) The amount of an annuity computed under 5 U.S.C. 8415 that would have been payable at the time of full retirement if the individual had not elected phased retirement status and as if the individual was employed on a full-time basis in the position occupied during the phased retirement period and before any reduction for survivor annuity.</P>
              <P>(2) In applying paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the individual must be deemed to have a full-time schedule during the period of phased retirement. The deemed full-time schedule will consist of five 8-hour workdays each workweek, resulting in a 40-hour workweek. In determining the individual's deemed rate of basic pay during phased retirement, only basic pay for hours within the deemed full-time schedule will be considered, consistent with the definition of “full-time” in § 848.102. Any premium pay creditable as basic pay for retirement purposes for overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule that an employee was receiving before phased retirement, such as standby duty pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1) or customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), may not be considered in determining a phased retiree's deemed rate of basic pay during phased retirement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The purpose of this part is to enable changes to OPM's retirement and insurance processing systems to improve the quality and timeliness of services to employees and annuitants covered by CSRS and FERS by using contemporary, automated business processes and supporting accessible technologies. By utilizing these automated processes, OPM will employ more efficient and effective business systems to respond to increased customer demand for higher levels of customer service and online self-service tools.</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions of this part authorize exceptions from regulatory provisions that would otherwise apply to CSRS and FERS annuities and FEGLI, FEHB, and RFEHB benefits processed by or at the direction of OPM. Those regulatory provisions that would otherwise apply were established for a hardcopy based retirement and insurance benefits processing system that may eventually be phased out but which will continue to operate concurrently with OPM's modernization efforts. During the phased transition to electronic retirement and insurance processing, certain regulations that were not designed with information technology needs in mind, and which are incompatible with electronic business processes, must be set aside with respect to electronic retirement and insurance processing. The regulations set forth in this part make the transition to electronic processing possible.</P>
              <P>(c) The provisions of this part do not affect retirement and insurance eligibility and annuity computation provisions. The provisions for capturing retirement and insurance data in an electronic format, however, may support, in some instances, more precise calculations of annuity and insurance benefits than were possible using hardcopy records.</P>

              <P>(b) The provisions of this part do not supersede or alter any functions performed by a private insurance company or carrier with which OPM has entered into a contract, or with which OPM may enter into a contract in the future, under chapter 87 or 89 of title 5, United States Code, or under any other provision of law or regulation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withholdings and contributions for Basic insurance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The cost of Basic insurance is shared between the insured individual and the Government. The employee pays two-thirds of the cost, and the Government pays one-third.</P>

              <P>(2) When OPM makes any adjustment to the Basic life insurance premium, it will issue a public notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b)(1) During each pay period in which an insured employee is in pay status for any part of the period, the employee's share of the premium must be withheld from the employee's biweekly pay. The amount withheld from the pay of an employee who is paid on other than a biweekly basis must be computed and adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of one cent.</P>
              <P>(2) The amount withheld from the pay of an insured employee whose annual pay is paid during a period shorter than 52 work weeks is the amount obtained by converting the biweekly rate to an annual rate and prorating the annual rate over the number of installments of pay regularly paid during the year.</P>
              <P>(3) The amount withheld from the pay of an insured employee whose BIA changes during a pay period is based on the BIA last in force during the pay period.</P>
              <P>(c) For each pay period in which an employee is insured, the employing agency must contribute an amount equal to one-half the amount withheld from the employee's pay. This agency contribution must come from the appropriation or fund that is used for the payment of the employee's pay. For an elected official, the contribution must come from the appropriation or fund that is available for payment of other salaries in the same office.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) For an annuitant or compensationer who elects to continue Basic insurance and chooses the maximum reduction of 75 percent after age 65 under § 870.702(a)(2), the annuitant's share of the premium is withheld monthly and the compensationer's share is withheld every 4 weeks. These withholdings stop the month after the month in which the annuitant or compensationer reaches age 65. There are no withholdings from individuals who retired or began receiving compensation before January 1, 1990, and who elected the 75 percent reduction. For the purpose of this paragraph, an individual who separates from service after meeting the requirements for an immediate annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8412(g) is considered to retire on the day before the annuity begins.</P>

              <P>(2) An annuitant or compensationer who elects to continue Basic insurance and chooses either the reduction election of 50 percent or the election of no <PRTPAGE P="445"/>reduction after age 65 under § 870.702(a)(3) or (4) pays an additional premium for the 50 percent or no reduction election. This additional premium is withheld for each $1,000 of the BIA. At age 65, the Basic premium will stop, but the annuitant or compensationer must continue to pay the additional premium for either the 50 percent or the no reduction election.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) For each period in which an annuitant or compensationer is insured, OPM must contribute an amount equal to one-half the amount that would be withheld under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Exception: for USPS employees who become annuitants or compensationers after December 31, 1989, the Postal Service pays the Government contributions.</P>
              <P>(2) The Government contribution is the same amount whether the individual elects a maximum 75 percent reduction, a maximum 50 percent reduction, or no reduction.</P>
              <P>(3) The Government contribution stops the month after the month in which the individual reaches age 65.</P>
              <P>(f) When an agency withholds less than or none of the proper amount of Basic life insurance deductions from an individual's pay, annuity, or compensation, the agency must submit an amount equal to the sum of the uncollected deduction and any applicable agency contributions required under 5 U.S.C. 8708 to OPM for deposit in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund.</P>

              <P>(2) Optional insurance premiums are based on 5-year age bands beginning at age 35. The last age band for Option A is age 60+. The last age band for Options B and C is 80+. For the purpose of this subpart, effective April 24, 1999, an individual is considered to reach the next age band the 1st day of the pay period following the pay period in which his/her birthday occurs.</P>

              <P>(3) When OPM makes any adjustment to the Optional life insurance premiums, it will issue a public notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(c)(1) Subject to the provisions for reemployed annuitants in § 870.707, the full cost of Optional insurance must be withheld from the annuity of an annuitant the compensation of a compensationer.</P>
              <P>(2) The withholdings for Option A stop the month after the month in which an annuitant or compensationer reaches age 65.</P>
              <P>(3) For an annuitant or compensationer who elects Full Reduction for any Option B or Option C multiples under § 870.705, the withholdings for those multiples stop the month after the month in which he/she reaches age 65.</P>
              <P>(4) For an annuitant or compensationer who elects No Reduction for any Option B or Option C multiples, the withholdings for those multiples continue, as long as he/she remains insured.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) For Option A and Option C, the amount withheld from pay, annuity, or compensation paid on other than a biweekly basis must be computed and adjusted to the nearest cent.</P>
              <P>(2) For Option B, the amount withheld from pay, annuity, or compensation paid on other than a biweekly basis must be computed and adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of 1 cent.</P>
              <P>(e) If an employee's annual pay is paid during a period shorter than 52 work weeks, the employing office must determine the amount to withhold. To do this, it converts the biweekly cost to an annual cost and prorates it over the number of installments of pay regularly paid during the year.</P>

              <P>(f) When an agency withholds less than or none of the proper amount of Optional life insurance deductions from an individual's pay, annuity, or compensation, the agency must submit an amount equal to the uncollected deductions required under 5 U.S.C. 8714a, <PRTPAGE P="446"/>8714b, and 8714c to OPM for deposit in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund.</P>

The agency must determine whether to waive collection of the overpayment of pay, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5584, as implemented by 4 CFR chapter I, subchapter G.

              <SUBJECT>Direct premium payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Since January 1, 1988, annuitants who retired under 5 U.S.C. chapter 84 (Federal Employees' Retirement System) have been able to make direct premium payments if their annuity became too small to cover the premiums. Effective the first pay period beginning on or after October 30, 1998, all employees, annuitants, and compensationers whose pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient to cover the withholdings can make direct premium payments.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) For an individual to be eligible to make direct premium payments, the employing office or retirement system must determine that the pay, annuity, or compensation, after all other deductions, is expected to be insufficient on an ongoing basis, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> for the next 6 months or more.</P>
              <P>(2) This section does not apply to employees in nonpay status. Employees in nonpay status are governed by § 870.404(c).</P>

              <P>(c)(1) When the employing office or retirement system determines that the <PRTPAGE P="447"/>pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient, and will be insufficient on an ongoing basis, it must notify the insured individual (or the assignee, if the individual has assigned his/her insurance under subpart I of this part) in writing and inform him/her of the available choices.</P>
              <P>(2) Within 31 calendar days of receiving the notice (60 days for individuals living overseas), the insured individual (or assignee) must return the notice to the employing office or retirement system, choosing either to terminate some or all of the insurance or to make direct premium payments. An employee, annuitant, or compensationer is considered to receive a mailed notice 15 days after the date of the notice.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Basic insurance: Effective dates of automatic coverage.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) When an employee is appointed or transferred to a position in which he/she is eligible for insurance, the employee is automatically insured for Basic insurance on the day he/she enters on duty in pay status, unless, before the end of the first pay period, the employee files a waiver of Basic insurance with the employing office or had previously filed a waiver which remains in effect.</P>
              <P>(2) An insured employee who moves to another covered position is automatically insured on the effective date of the move, unless the employee files a waiver of Basic insurance with the new employing office before the end of the first pay period in the new position.</P>
              <P>(3) When an employee of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority elects to be considered a Federal employee under section 153 of Pub. L. 104-134 (110 Stat. 1321), he/she is automatically insured on (i) the date the employee enters on duty in pay status with the Authority, or (ii) the date the Authority receives the employee's election to be considered a Federal employee, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(b) An employee who returns to pay and duty status after a period of more than 12 months of nonpay status is automatically insured at the time he/she actually enters on duty in pay status, unless, before the end of the first pay period, the employee files a waiver of Basic insurance coverage with the employing office or had previously filed a waiver which remains in effect.</P>
              <P>(c) For an employee who serves in cooperation with a non-Federal agency and who is paid in whole or in part from non-Federal funds, OPM sets the effective date. This date must be part of an agreement between OPM and the non-Federal agency. The agreement must provide either:</P>
              <P>(1) That the required withholdings and contributions be made from Federally controlled funds and deposited into the Employees' Life Insurance Fund on a timely basis, or</P>
              <P>(2) That the cooperating non-Federal agency, by written agreement with the Federal agency, make the required withholdings and contributions from non-Federal funds and transmit that amount to the Federal agency for deposit into the Employees' Life Insurance Fund on a timely basis.</P>
              <P>(d) If an employee waived Basic insurance on or before February 28, 1981, the waiver was automatically cancelled effective on the 1st day the employee entered on duty in pay status on or after April 1, 1981. Basic insurance coverage was automatically effective on the date of the waiver's cancellation, unless the employee filed a new waiver of Basic insurance with the employing office before the end of the pay period during which the coverage became effective.</P>

              <P>(a) An insured individual may cancel his/her Basic insurance at any time by filing a waiver of Basic insurance coverage. An employee files with the employing office. An annuitant files with OPM or other office that administers his/her retirement system. If still employed, a compensationer files with the employing office, and if not still employed, with OPM. The waiver is effective, and the insurance stops, at the end of the pay period in which the waiver is properly filed. Exception: an individual who has assigned his/her insurance under subpart I of this part cannot cancel the insurance.</P>
              <P>(b) An individual who cancels his/her Basic insurance automatically cancels all forms of Optional insurance.</P>

              <P>(1) The employee makes an election during an open enrollment period as described in § 870.507;</P>
              <P>(2) At least 1 year has passed since the effective date of the waiver, and the employee provides satisfactory medical evidence of insurability; or</P>
              <P>(3) The employee has a change in family circumstances (marriage or divorce, a spouse's death, or acquisition of an eligible child) and files an election as provided in paragraph (b)(3(i), (b)(3)(ii), or (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii), the effective date of Basic insurance elected under this paragraph (b)(3) is the 1st day the employee actually enters on duty in a pay status on or after the day the employing office receives the election.</P>
              <P>(i) An employee must file an election under this paragraph with the employing office, in a manner designated by OPM, along with proof of the event, no later than 60 calendar days following the date of the change in family circumstances that permits the election; the employee may also file the election before the event and provide proof no later than 60 calendar days following the event.</P>
              <P>(ii) An employee making an election under this paragraph based on acquisition of an eligible foster child must file the election with the employing office no later than 60 calendar days after completing the required certification.</P>
              <P>(iii) Within 6 months after an employee becomes eligible to make an election of Basic insurance due to a change in family circumstances, an employing office may determine that the employee was unable, for reasons beyond his or her control, to elect Basic insurance within the time limit. In this case, the employee must elect Basic insurance within 60 calendar days after he or she is notified of the determination. The insurance is retroactive to the 1st day of the first pay period beginning after the date the individual became eligible, if the employee was in pay and duty status that day. If the employee was not in pay and duty status that day, the coverage becomes effective the 1st day after the date the employee returned to pay and duty status. The individual must pay the full cost of the Basic insurance from that date for the time that he or she is in pay status.</P>
              <P>(c) OFEGLI reviews the employee's request and determines whether the employee complied with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the employee complied, then OFEGLI approves the Request for Insurance. The Basic insurance is effective on the date of OFEGLI's approval if the employee is in pay and duty status on that date. If the employee is not in pay and duty status on the date of OFEGLI's approval, the Basic insurance is effective the first day the employee returns to pay and duty status, as long as it is within 60 calendar days after OFEGLI's approval. If the employee is not in pay and duty status within 60 calendar days after OFEGLI's approval, the approval is revoked automatically.</P>

              <P>(d) When an employee who has been separated from service for at least 180 days is reinstated on or after April 1, 1981, a previous waiver of Basic insurance is automatically cancelled. Unless the employee files a new waiver, Basic insurance becomes effective on the 1st day he or she actually enters on duty in pay status in a position in which he or she is eligible for coverage. <E T="03">Exception:</E> For employees who waived Basic insurance after February 28, 1981, separated, and returned to Federal service before December 9, 1983, the waiver remained in effect; these employees were permitted to elect Basic insurance by applying to their employing office before March 7, 1984.</P>

              <P>(2) An election of Basic insurance under paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be made within 60 days of being designated “emergency essential.” Basic insurance is effective on the date the employing office receives the election, if the employee is in pay and duty status on that date. If the employee is not in pay and duty status on the day the employing office receives the election, the coverage becomes effective on the date the employee returns to pay and duty status.<PRTPAGE P="450"/>

              <SUBJECT>Optional insurance: Election.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a)(1) Each employee must elect or waive Option A, Option B, and Option C coverage, in a manner designated by OPM, within 60 days after becoming eligible unless, during earlier employment, he or she filed an election or waiver that remains in effect. The 60-day time limit for Option B or Option C begins on the 1st day after February 28, 1981, on which an individual is an <E T="03">employee</E> as defined in § 870.101.</P>
              <P>(2) An employee of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority who elects to be considered a Federal employee under section 153 of Public Law 104-134 (110 Stat. 1321) must elect or waive Option A, Option B, and Option C coverage within 31 days after the later of:</P>
              <P>(i) The date his or her employment with the Authority begins, or</P>
              <P>(ii) The date the Authority receives his or her election to be considered a Federal employee.</P>
              <P>(3) Within 6 months after an employee becomes eligible, an employing office may determine that the employee was unable, for reasons beyond his or her control, to elect any type of Optional insurance within the time limit. In this case, the employee must elect or waive that type of Optional insurance within 60 days after being notified of the determination. The insurance is retroactive to the 1st day of the 1st pay period beginning after the date the individual became eligible (or after April 1, 1981, whichever is later), if the employee was in pay and duty status that day. If the employee was not in pay and duty status that day, the coverage becomes effective the 1st day after the date the employee returned to pay and duty status. The individual must pay the full cost of the Optional insurance from that date for the time that he or she is in pay status (or retired or receiving compensation with unreduced Optional insurance).</P>
              <P>(b) Any employee who does not file a Life Insurance Election with his or her employing office, in a manner designated by OPM, specifically electing any type of Optional insurance, is considered to have waived it and does not have that type of Optional insurance.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purpose of having Option A as an employee, an election of this insurance filed on or before February 28, 1981, is considered to have been cancelled effective at the end of the pay period which included March 31, 1981, unless the employee did not actually enter on duty in pay status during the 1st pay period that began on or after April 1, 1981. In that case, the election is considered to have been cancelled on the 1st day after the end of the next pay period in which the employee actually entered on duty in pay status. In order to have Option A as an employee after the date of this cancellation, an employee must specifically elect the coverage by filing the Life Insurance Election with his or her employing office, subject to § 870.504(a) or 870.506(b).</P>
              <P>(d) Optional insurance is effective the 1st day an employee actually enters on duty in pay status on or after the day the employing office receives the election. If the employee is not in pay and duty status on the date the employing office receives the election, the coverage becomes effective the next date that the employee is in pay and duty status.</P>

              <P>(e) For an employee whose Optional insurance stopped for a reason other than a waiver, the insurance is reinstated on the 1st day he or she actually <PRTPAGE P="451"/>enters on duty in pay status in a position in which he or she again becomes eligible.</P>

In this case, the employee must elect or increase Optional insurance within 60 calendar days after he or she is notified of the determination. The insurance is retroactive to the 1st day of the first pay period beginning after the date the individual became eligible if the employee was in pay and duty status that day. If the employee was not in pay and duty status that day, the coverage <PRTPAGE P="452"/>becomes effective the 1st day after that date the employee returned to pay and duty status. The individual must pay the full cost of the Optional insurance from that date for the time that he or she is in pay status.</P>
              <P>(6)(i) The effective date of Options A and B insurance elected under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is the 1st day the employee actually enters on duty in pay status on or after the day the employing office receives the election.</P>

              <P>(c) OFEGLI reviews the employee's request and determines whether the employee complied with paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) of this section. If the employee complied, then OFEGLI approves the Request for Insurance. The Option A and B insurance is effective on the date of OFEGLI's approval, if the employee is in pay and duty status on that date. If the employee is not in pay and duty status on the date of OFEGLI's approval, the insurance is effective the first day the employee returns to pay and duty status, as long as it is within 60 calendar days of OFEGLI's approval. If the employee is not in pay and duty status within 60 calendar days after OFEGLI's approval, the approval is revoked automatically.</P>
              <P>(d) If an employee waived Option A insurance on or before February 28, 1981, the waiver was automatically cancelled effective on the 1st day the employee entered on duty in pay status on or after April 1, 1981. Option A coverage was effective on the date of the waiver's cancellation, if the employee filed an election of Option A during the March 1, 1981, through March 31, 1981, open enrollment period. If the employee did not file the election with his or her employing office during the March 1981 open enrollment period, the employee is considered to have waived Option A on March 31, 1981.</P>
              <P>(e) When an employee who has been separated from service for at least 180 days is reinstated on or after April 1, 1981, a previous waiver of Optional insurance is automatically cancelled, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) An employee who returned to service between April 1, 1981, and December 8, 1983, after a 180-day break in service was permitted to elect any form of Optional insurance by applying to his or her employing office before March 7, 1984.</P>

Coverage is effective on the 1st day the employee actually enters on duty in pay status in a position in which he or <PRTPAGE P="453"/>she is eligible for insurance on or after the date the employing office receives the election. If the employee does not file a Life Insurance Election in a manner designated by OPM within the 60-day period, the employee has whatever Optional insurance coverage he or she had immediately before separating from Federal service and is considered to have waived any other Optional insurance. However, an employee who fails to file an election during the 60-day period due to reasons beyond his or her control may enroll belatedly under the conditions stated in § 870.504(a)(3).</P>
              <P>(f)(1) An employee of the Department of Defense who is designated as “emergency essential” under section 1580 of title 10, United States Code, may cancel a waiver of Option A and Option B insurance.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Open enrollment periods.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) There are no regularly scheduled open enrollment periods for life insurance. Open enrollment periods are held only when specifically scheduled by OPM.</P>
              <P>(b) During an open enrollment period, unless OPM announces otherwise, eligible employees may cancel their existing waivers of Basic and/or Optional insurance by electing the insurance in a manner designated by OPM.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) OPM sets the effective date for all insurance elected during an open enrollment period. The newly elected insurance is effective on the 1st day of the 1st pay period that begins on or after the OPM-established date and that follows a pay period during which the employee was in pay and duty status for at least 32 hours, unless OPM announces otherwise.</P>
              <P>(2) A part-time employee must be in pay and duty status for one-half the regularly-scheduled tour of duty shown on his or her current Standard Form 50 for newly-elected coverage to become effective, unless OPM announces otherwise.</P>
              <P>(3) An employee who has no regularly-scheduled tour of duty or who is employed on an intermittent basis must be in pay and duty status for one-half the hours customarily worked before newly-elected coverage can become effective, unless OPM announces otherwise. For the purpose of this paragraph, an employing office may determine the number of hours customarily worked by averaging the number of hours worked in the most recent calendar year quarter prior to the start of the open enrollment period.</P>

              <P>(d) Within 6 months after an open enrollment period ends, an employing office may determine that an employee was unable, for reasons beyond his or her control, to cancel an existing waiver by electing to be insured during the open enrollment period. An election under this paragraph must be submitted within 60 days after being notified of the determination. Coverage is retroactive to the first pay period that begins on or after the effective date set <PRTPAGE P="454"/>by OPM and that follows a pay period during which the employee was in pay and duty status for at least 32 hours, unless OPM announces otherwise. If the employee does not file an election within this 60-day time limit, he or she will be considered to have waived coverage.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Nonpay status.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An employee who is in nonpay status is entitled to continue life insurance for up to 12 months. No premium payments are required, unless the employee is receiving compensation.</P>
              <P>(b) If an insured employee who is entitled to free insurance while in nonpay status accepts a temporary appointment to a position in which he or she would normally be excluded from insurance coverage, the insurance continues. The amount of Basic insurance (and Option B coverage if the employee has it) is based on the combined salaries of the two positions. Withholdings are made from the employee's pay in the temporary position.</P>
              <P>(c) If an insured employee goes on leave without pay (LWOP) to serve as a full-time officer or employee of an employee organization, he or she may elect in writing to continue life insurance within 60 days after the beginning of the LWOP. The insurance continues for the length of the appointment, even if the LWOP lasts longer than 12 months. The employee must pay to the employing office the full cost of Basic and Optional insurance starting with the beginning of the nonpay status; the employee is not entitled to 12 months of free coverage. There is no Government contribution for these employees.</P>
              <P>(d) If an insured employee goes on LWOP while assigned to a State government, local government, or institution of higher education, the employee may elect in writing to continue the life insurance for the length of the assignment, even if the LWOP lasts longer than 12 months. The employee must pay his or her premiums to the Federal agency on a current basis starting with the beginning of the nonpay status; the employee is not entitled to 12 months of free coverage. The agency must continue to pay its contribution as long as the employee makes his or her payments.</P>

              <P>(b) Cessation of employment with the Corporation for any period terminates eligibility for coverage under FEGLI as an employee during any subsequent employment by the Corporation.</P>
              <P>(c) The Corporation must withhold from the pay of an individual described by paragraph (a) of this section an amount equal to the premiums withheld from the pay of a Federal employee for FEGLI coverage and, in accordance with procedures established by OPM, pay into the Employees' Life Insurance Fund the amounts deducted from the individual's pay.</P>

              <P>(d) The Corporation must, in accordance with procedures established by <PRTPAGE P="455"/>OPM, pay into the Employees' Life Insurance Fund amounts equal to any agency contributions required under FEGLI.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section or § 870.701, the Basic insurance of an insured employee stops on the date the employee separates from service, subject to a 31-day extension of coverage. <E T="03">Exception:</E> If the employee was employed by the Architect of the Capitol as a Senate Restaurants employee the day before the food services operations of the Senate Restaurants were transferred to a private business concern and the employee accepted employment by the business concern and elected to continue his or her Federal retirement benefits and FEGLI coverage, the employee continues to be eligible for FEGLI coverage as long as he or she remains employed by the business concern or its successor.</P>
              <P>(b) The Basic insurance of an employee who separates from service after meeting the requirement for an immediate annuity under § 842.204(a)(1) of this chapter and who postpones receiving the annuity, as provided by § 842.204(c) of this chapter (an MRA+10 annuity), stops on the date he or she separates from service, subject to a 31-day extension of coverage.</P>

              <P>(c) The Basic insurance of an insured employee who moves without a break in service to a position in which he or she is excluded from life insurance stops on the last day of employment in the former position, subject to a 31-day extension of coverage. <E T="03">Exception:</E> If the position is excluded by regulation (not by law), and the employee does not have a break in service of more than three days, the Basic insurance continues.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Except as provided in § 870.701, the Basic insurance of an insured employee who is in nonpay status stops on the date the employee completes 12 months in nonpay status, subject to a 31-day extension of coverage.

If an employee has at least 4 consecutive months in pay status after a period of nonpay status, he or she is entitled to begin the 12 months' continuation of Basic insurance again. If an employee has used up his or her 12 months' continuation in nonpay status and returns to duty for less than 4 consecutive months, his or her Basic insurance stops on the 32nd day after the last day of the last pay period in pay status.</P>
              <P>(2) For the purpose of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 4 consecutive months in pay status means any 4-month period during which the employee is in pay status for at least part of each pay period.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) For the purpose of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an individual who is entitled to benefits under part 353 of this chapter (USERRA—Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act of 1994), who separates to go on military duty instead of going into a nonpay status, is treated as an employee in nonpay status for life insurance purposes.</P>
              <P>(ii) Basic insurance continues free for 12 months or until 90 days after military service ends, whichever comes first.</P>
              <P>(iii) Effective January 28, 2008, an employee who enters on active duty, or active duty for training in one of the uniformed services for more than 30 days, may continue enrollment for an additional 12 months, for a total of up to 24 months.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Conversion of Basic and Optional insurance.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a)(1) When group coverage terminates for any reason other than voluntary cancellation, an employee may apply to convert all or any part of his or her Basic and Optional insurance to an individual policy; no medical examination is required. The premiums for the individual policy are based on the employee's age and class of risk. An employee is eligible to convert the policy only if he or she does not return, within 3 calendar days from the terminating event, to a position covered under the group plan. <E T="03">Exception:</E> If an employee is unable to convert, a person having power of attorney for that employee may convert on his or her behalf. If insurance has been assigned under subpart I of this part, it is the assignee(s), not the employee, who has (have) the right to convert.</P>

              <P>(2) The employing agency must notify the employee/assignee(s) of the loss of coverage and the right to convert to an individual policy either before or immediately after the event causing the loss of coverage.<PRTPAGE P="457"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The employee/assignee(s) must submit the request for conversion information to OFEGLI. OFEGLI must receive the request for conversion within 31 calendar days of the date on the conversion notification the employee receives from the employing agency (60 days if overseas) or within 60 calendar days after the date of the terminating event (90 days, if overseas), whichever is earlier.</P>
              <P>(4) If the employee does not request conversion information within the specified time period as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the employee is considered to have refused coverage unless OFEGLI determines the failure was for reasons beyond the employee's control, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) When an agency fails to provide the notification required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or the employee/assignee fails to request conversion information within the time limit set in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for reasons beyond his or her control, the employee may make a belated request by writing to OFEGLI. The employee/assignee must make the request within 6 months after becoming eligible to convert the insurance. The employee/assignee must show that he or she was not notified of the loss of coverage and the right to convert and was not otherwise aware of it or that he or she was unable to convert to an individual policy for reasons beyond his or her control. OFEGLI will determine if the employee/assignee is eligible to convert. If the request is approved, the employee must convert within 31 calendar days of that determination.</P>
              <P>(b) The individual conversion policy is effective the day after the group coverage ends. The employee/assignee must pay the premiums for any period retroactive to that date.</P>
              <P>(c) The 31-day extension of coverage provided under this subpart does not depend upon timely notification of the right to convert to an individual policy. The extension cannot be continued beyond 31 days.</P>
              <P>(d) Family members may convert Option C coverage (and name beneficiaries of their choice) if:</P>
              <P>(1) The employee dies; or</P>
              <P>(2) The insurance stops under circumstances that allow the employee to convert Option C coverage but the employee does not convert.</P>
              <P>(e) If an employee with Option C coverage dies, the employing office must send a conversion notice to the family members at the employee's last address on file.</P>
              <P>(f) Family members must submit the request for conversion information to OFEGLI. OFEGLI must receive the request for conversion within 31 calendar days of the date on the conversion notification the employee receives from his or her employing agency (60 days if overseas) or within 60 calendar days after the date of the terminating event (90 days, if overseas), whichever is earlier. There is no extension to these time limits. Family members are considered to have refused coverage if they do not request conversion within these time limits.</P>
              <P>(g) The family members' conversion policy is effective at the end of the employee's 31-day extension of coverage.</P>

              <P>(3) Has not converted to an individual policy as described in § 870.603. If it is determined that an individual is eligible to continue the group coverage as an annuitant after he/she has already converted to an individual policy, the group enrollment may be reinstated. If <PRTPAGE P="458"/>the individual wants the group coverage reinstated, the conversion policy must be voided, the group policy must be reinstated retroactively, and the premiums already paid on the conversion policy must be refunded to the individual.</P>
              <P>(b) Following separation or the completion of 12 months' nonpay status, a compensationer's Basic life insurance (but not accidental death and dismemberment) continues or is reinstated if he/she:</P>
              <P>(1) Has been insured for the 5 years of service immediately before the date of entitlement to compensation, or for the full period(s) of service during which he/she was eligible to be insured if less than 5 years; and</P>
              <P>(2) Has not converted to an individual policy as described in § 870.603. If it is not determined that an individual is eligible to continue the group coverage as a compensationer until after he/she has converted, the group enrollment may be reinstated. If the individual wants the group coverage reinstated, the conversion policy must be voided, the group policy must be reinstated retroactively, and the premiums already paid on the conversion policy must be refunded to the individual.</P>
              <P>(c) An individual who meets the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section or § 870.706 for continuation or reinstatement of life insurance must complete an election, in a manner designated by OPM, at the time entitlement is established. For the election to be valid, OPM must receive the election before OPM has made a final decision on the individual's application for annuity or supplemental annuity or an individual's request to continue life insurance as a compensationer. If there is no valid election, OPM considers the individual to have chosen the option described in § 870.703(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(d) If the annuity or compensation of an insured individual is terminated, or if the Department of Labor finds that an insured compensationer is able to return to duty, his/her Basic life insurance held as an annuitant or compensationer stops on the date of the termination or finding. There is no 31-day extension of coverage or conversion right.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) An annuitant or compensationer who is eligible to continue or have reinstated Basic insurance is also eligible to continue or have reinstated Optional insurance if he/she meets the same coverage requirements for Optional insurance as those stated in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section for Basic insurance.</P>
              <P>(2) For the purpose of continuing insurance as an annuitant or compensationer, an employee is not considered to have been eligible for Option C during any period when the employee had no eligible family members.</P>
              <P>(f) An individual's period of coverage in a life insurance plan is credited to the 5 years of service under paragraph (a)(2) of this section if:</P>
              <P>(1) He/she participated in the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) life insurance plan and transferred to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203; and</P>
              <P>(2) Elected FEGLI coverage during the special enrollment period between June 1, 2012 and July 29, 2012. Evidence of the non-FEGLI period of continuous coverage will be documented in a manner designated by OPM.</P>

There are two choices: Full Reduction and No Reduction. The election may be made only by the employee and must be made in the manner that OPM designates. The employee may make different elections for Option B and for Option C. He or she may choose Full Reduction for some multiples of an Option and No Reduction for other multiples of the same Option. Failure to make an election for Option B or for Option C will be considered to be an election of Full Reduction for all multiples of that Option.</P>

              <P>(4)(i) Shortly before an annuitant or compensationer's 65th birthday, an annuitant's retirement system will send a reminder about the post-age-65 reduction election he/she made and will offer the individual a chance to change the initial election made at the time of retirement.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the individual is already 65 or older at the time of retirement or becoming insured as a compensationer, the retirement system will process the retirement using the current Continuation of Life Insurance Coverage (SF 2818) on file, send the reminder, and give the opportunity to change the election as soon as the retirement processing or compensation transfer is complete.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the individual assigned his/her insurance as provided in subpart I of this part, and if the employee elected No Reduction for Option B coverage at the time of retirement or becoming insured as a compensationer, the retirement system will send the reminder notice for Option B coverage to the assignee.</P>

An annuitant or compensationer who does not return the election notice will keep his/her initial election or the default election, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) For each multiple of Option B and/or Option C for which an individual elects Full Reduction, the coverage reduces by 2 percent of the original amount each month. This reduction starts at the beginning of the 2nd month after the date the insurance would otherwise have stopped or the beginning of the 2nd month after the insured's 65th birthday, whichever is later. At 12:00 noon on the day before the 50th reduction, the insurance stops, with no extension of coverage or conversion right.</P>
              <P>(2) For each multiple of Option B and/or Option C for which an individual elects No Reduction, the coverage in force does not reduce. After age 65 the annuitant or compensationer continues to pay premiums appropriate to his or her age.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) An employee who was already retired or insured as a compensationer on April 24, 1999, and who had Option B, was given an opportunity to make an election for Option B.</P>
              <P>(i) Annuitants and compensationers who were under age 65 were notified of the option to elect No Reduction. The retirement system will send these individuals an actual election notice before their 65th birthday, as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>

The individual had until October 24, 1999, to make the No Reduction election. The amount of Option B coverage retained was the amount in effect on April 24, 1999. Each annuitant or compensationer who elected No Reduction was required to pay premiums retroactive to April 24, 1999.</P>

              <P>(a) (1) Section 208 of the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-353 (98 Stat. 355), effective July 10, 1984, permits Federal judges to irrevocably assign their FEGLI coverage to one or more individuals, corporations, or trustees. Section 4 of Pub. L. 103-336 (108 Stat. 2661), effective October 3, 1994, extended this right to all Federal employees, annuitants, and compensationers.</P>
              <P>(2) An individual may assign ownership of all life insurance under this part, except Option C. If an individual wishing to make an assignment owns more than one type of coverage, he/she must assign all the insurance; an individual cannot assign only a portion of the coverage. Option C cannot be assigned.</P>
              <P>(b) An individual cannot name conditional assignees in case the primary assignee dies before the insured individual.</P>
              <P>(c) If the insurance is assigned to two or more individuals, corporations, or trustees, the insured individual must specify percentage shares, rather than dollar amounts or types of insurance, to go to each assignee.</P>

              <P>(d) If an individual who has made an assignment later elects increased insurance coverage under § 870.506 or during an open enrollment period, the increased coverage is considered included in the already existing assignment. The right to increase coverage remains with the insured individual, rather than transferring to the assignee.<PRTPAGE P="466"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) An individual who assigns ownership of insurance continues to be the insured individual, but the assignee receives those rights of an insured individual that are specified in this part.</P>
              <P>(f) Once assigned, the value of the insurance increases or decreases automatically as provided by this part. Exception: if the insured individual elected a Living Benefit before assigning the remainder of his/her insurance, the amount of Basic insurance does not increase or decrease.</P>
              <P>(g) An insured individual who has assigned his/her insurance cannot elect a Living Benefit; nor can an assignee elect a Living Benefit on behalf of the insured individual.</P>
              <P>(h) An insured individual who has elected a Living Benefit under subpart K of this part may assign the remainder of his/her insurance. The assignment would affect Option A, Option B, and, for an employee who elected a partial Living Benefit, Basic insurance.</P>
              <P>(i) A court order can direct that an insured individual make an irrevocable assignment to the person(s) named in the court order. For an assignment to be effective, the insured individual must follow the procedures in § 870.902.</P>

              <P>(2) When there is more than one assignee, each assignee has the right to convert all or part of his/her share of the insurance. Any assignee who doesn't convert loses all ownership of the insurance.</P>

              <P>(3) When there is more than one assignee, the maximum amount of insurance each assignee will be able to convert is determined by the dollar amount corresponding to the assignee's share of the total insurance.

              <P>(1) At the time he/she retires or becomes eligible as a compensationer, the insured individual may elect unreduced or partially reduced insurance coverage as provided in § 870.702(a). This right remains with the insured individual and does not transfer to the assignee. Exception: if the insured individual elected a partial Living Benefit as an employee under subpart K of this part, he/she can only elect unreduced insurance coverage.</P>
              <P>(2) After the individual has made the election described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the assignee (or, if more than one, all of the assignees acting together) may, at any time, elect to cancel the annuitant's or compensationer's election of increased coverage, as provided in § 870.702(b). The right to cancel the election transfers to the assignee; the annuitant or compensationer cannot cancel the election after making an assignment. Exception: if the individual elected a partial Living Benefit as an employee under subpart K of this part, the assignee(s) cannot cancel the election of unreduced insurance coverage.</P>
              <P>(b) When more than one assignee has been named, at the time the insured individual becomes eligible to continue coverage as an annuitant or compensationer, some assignees may choose to convert their part of the insurance, while others may choose to continue the coverage during the insured individual's retirement or receipt of compensation. The amount of each type of continued insurance is determined by the total percentage of the shares of the assignees who choose to continue the coverage.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) When an annuitant who has assigned his/her insurance is reemployed in a position in which he/she is entitled to life insurance coverage, the coverage he/she acquires as a reemployed annuitant is subject to the existing assignment.</P>
              <P>(2) The right of a reemployed annuitant to elect Option B coverage as an employee rather than as an annuitant under § 870.705(d)(3) remains with the insured individual and does not transfer to the assignee. Any Option B coverage elected as an employee is subject to the existing assignment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Election procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The insured individual must request information on Living Benefits and an application form directly from OFEGLI.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The insured individual must complete the first part of the application and have his or her physician complete the second part. The completed application must be submitted directly to OFEGLI.</P>
              <P>(2) Another person may apply for a Living Benefit on the insured individual's behalf if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) The insured's physician must certify that the insured individual is physically or mentally incapable of making an election;</P>
              <P>(ii) The applicant must have power of attorney or a court order authorizing him or her to elect a Living Benefit on the insured individual's behalf;</P>
              <P>(iii) The applicant must place his or her own signature on the application and attach it to a true and correct copy of the power of attorney or court order authorizing the applicant to make the election on the insured individual's behalf; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The applicant must either be the insured individual's sole beneficiary or attach a true and correct copy of each beneficiary's written and signed consent.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) OFEGLI reviews the application, obtains certification from the insured's employing office regarding the amount of insurance and the absence of an assignment, and determines whether the individual meets the requirements to elect a Living Benefit.</P>
              <P>(2) If OFEGLI needs additional information, it will contact the insured or the insured's physician.</P>
              <P>(3) Under certain circumstances, OFEGLI may require a medical examination before making a decision. In these cases, OFEGLI is financially responsible for the cost of the medical examination.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) If the application is approved, OFEGLI sends the insured a check or makes an electronic funds transfer to the insured's account for the Living Benefit payment and an explanation of benefits.</P>
              <P>(i) Until the check has been cashed or deposited, or before the electronic funds transfer has been received, the individual may change his or her mind about electing a Living Benefit; if this happens, the individual must mark the check “void” and return it to OFEGLI.</P>
              <P>(ii) Once the insured individual has cashed or deposited the payment, the Living Benefit election becomes effective and cannot be revoked; OFEGLI then sends explanations of benefits to the insured's employing office, so it can make the necessary changes in withholdings and deductions.</P>
              <P>(2) If the application is not approved, OFEGLI will notify the insured individual and the employing office. The decision is not subject to administrative review; however, the individual may submit additional medical information or reapply at a later date if future circumstances warrant.</P>

              <P>(ix) Certify that they understand that willful falsification of the documentation described in paragraph (1)(viii) of this definition may lead to disciplinary action and the recovery of the cost of benefits received related to such falsification and may constitute a criminal violation under 18 U.S.C. 1001.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the steps required to resolve a dispute involving benefit eligibility or payment of a claim?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If you dispute the Carrier's denial of your eligibility for benefits or your claim for payment of benefits, you must first send a written request for reconsideration to the Carrier no later than 60 days from the date of its decision.</P>
              <P>(b) The Carrier must provide you with written notice of its review decision no later than 60 days after the date it receives your reconsideration request.</P>
              <P>(c) If the Carrier upholds its denial (or does not respond within 60 days), you have the right to appeal its reconsideration decision directly to the Carrier. You must make this appeal in writing within 60 days from the date of the Carrier's notice upholding its decision. You will be notified of the decision on your appeal in writing no later than 60 days from receipt of your appeal request.</P>
              <P>(d) If a denial of your eligibility for benefits or a denial of your claim is upheld upon appeal due to the evaluation of your medical condition/functional capacity, the Carrier will inform you that you may request that an independent third party, mutually agreed to by OPM and the Carrier, review the decision. You must make this request in writing within 60 days from the date of the notice informing you of the appeal decision. The independent third party must notify you in writing of its decision no later than 60 days from the Carrier's or its designee's receipt of your request for appeal to the third party. This is the final administrative remedy available to you. The decision of the independent third party is final and binding on the Carrier.</P>
              <P>(e) You may seek judicial review of the final administrative denial of a claim. Such action may not be brought prior to exhaustion of the administrative process provided in this section. To pursue such judicial review, you must bring legal action against the Carrier in an appropriate United States district court within 2 years from the date of the final decision. You may not sue OPM, the independent reviewer, or any other entity. If you prevail in court, your recovery is limited to the amount of benefits payable under your benefit booklet and schedule of benefits.</P>
              <P>(f) The procedures described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section apply only if you have valid coverage under the FLTCIP. If the Carrier determines that your coverage was based on an erroneous application and voids the coverage as described in § 875.408 of this part, these provisions do not apply. The Carrier will provide you with information on your review rights in its rescission letter (letter voiding your coverage).</P>

              <P>(e) If your employing office determines that you were unable, for a cause beyond your control, to submit an application during the initial 60-day period, you may submit an application within 60 days after your employing office advises you of that determination. Similarly, your employing office may make this determination if your spouse is unable to submit an application during the same time period for a cause beyond his/her control. This employing office authority only applies within 6 months after the beginning date of the initial eligibility period. The underwriting requirements will be as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Marriage.</E> (1) If you are an active workforce member and you have married, your spouse is eligible to submit an application for coverage under this section within 60 days from the date of your marriage and will be subject to the underwriting requirements in force for the spouses of active workforce members during the most recent open season. You, however, are not eligible for abbreviated underwriting because of your marriage. You, your spouse, or both you and your spouse may apply for coverage during this 60-day period, but full underwriting will be required <PRTPAGE P="479"/>for you. After 60 days from the date of your marriage, you and/or your spouse may still apply for coverage but will be subject to full underwriting.</P>
              <P>(2) If you are an active workforce member and you have entered into a domestic partnership, your domestic partner is eligible to submit an application for coverage under this section at any time from the commencing date of your domestic partnership and will be subject to full underwriting requirements. You are not eligible for abbreviated underwriting because of your domestic partnership. You, your domestic partner, or both you and your domestic partner may apply for coverage at any time, but full underwriting will be required for both of you.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Domestic partnership.</E> The new spouse or domestic partner of an annuitant or retired member of the uniformed services may apply for coverage with full underwriting at any time following the marriage or commencing date of the domestic partnership.</P>

              <SUBJECT>May I change my coverage?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) You may make the following changes to your coverage:</P>
              <P>(1) You may apply to increase your coverage at any time. Full underwriting is required, except when an open season allows abbreviated underwriting.</P>
              <P>(2) If you increase your coverage by adding to your daily benefit amount, the premiums for the additional coverage will be based on your age, prevailing premium rates, and coverage rules in effect at the time you purchase the additional coverage.</P>
              <P>(3) For other types of coverage increases, your entire premium will be based on your age, prevailing premium rates, and coverage rules in effect at the time you purchase the increased coverage. Any increase in coverage will take effect on the 1st day of the month following the date the Carrier approves your request for an increase.</P>
              <P>(b) You may decrease your coverage at any time, although any decrease will be subject to coverage rules at the time of the decrease. Decreased coverage takes effect on the 1st day of the month after the Carrier receives your request. You will not receive any refund of premiums paid for coverage you held before the decrease; however, your subsequent premiums will be reduced based on your new, lower level of coverage. The Carrier will refund or credit any portion of premium paid in advance for the period following the date on which you decrease your coverage.</P>
              <P>(c) You may cancel your coverage at any time.</P>
              <P>(1) If you cancel during the free look period, your premiums will be refunded to you.</P>
              <P>(2) If you cancel your coverage at any time other than during the free look period, cancellation will take effect on your requested cancellation date or at the end of the period covered by your last premium payment, whichever occurs first. You will not receive any refund of premiums paid, other than any premiums paid in advance for the period following the effective date of your cancellation of coverage, and you will not have to pay any more premiums unless you owed retroactive premiums.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the significance of incontestability?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Incontestability means coverage issued based on an erroneous application may remain in effect. Such coverage will not remain in effect under any of the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) If your coverage has been in force for less than 6 months, the Carrier may void your coverage upon a showing that information on your signed application that was material to your approval for coverage is different from what is shown in your medical records.</P>

              <P>(2) If your coverage has been in force for at least 6 months but less than 2 years, the Carrier may void your coverage upon a showing that information <PRTPAGE P="480"/>on your signed application that was material to your approval for coverage is different from what is shown in your medical records and pertains to the condition for which benefits are sought.</P>
              <P>(3) After your coverage has been in effect for 2 years, the Carrier may void your coverage only upon a showing that you knowingly and intentionally made a false or misleading statement or omitted information in your signed application for coverage regarding your health status that was material to your approval for coverage.</P>
              <P>(4) If your coverage is voided, as described in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section, no claims will be paid. In addition, the provisions of § 875.104 relating to the procedures for resolving a dispute involving benefits eligibility or claims denials do not apply to your situation. You may request a review by the Carrier if you believe that your coverage was voided in error. You must submit your request in writing to the Carrier within 30 days of the date of the rescission letter (letter voiding your coverage).</P>
              <P>(b) Your coverage can be contested at any time when the Carrier finds that you were not an eligible individual at the time you applied and were approved for coverage.</P>
              <P>(c) If the Carrier voids coverage after it has paid benefits, it cannot recover the benefits already paid.</P>
              <P>(d) Incontestability does not apply when you have not paid your premiums on a timely basis.</P>

              <P>(d) The date you have exhausted your maximum lifetime benefit. (However, in this event, care coordination services will continue.)</P>

              <SUBJECT>Is it possible to have coverage reinstated?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Under certain circumstances, your coverage can be reinstated. The Carrier will reinstate your coverage if it receives proof satisfactory to it, within 6 months from the termination <PRTPAGE P="481"/>date, that you suffered from a cognitive impairment or loss of functional capacity, before the grace period ended, that caused you to miss making premium payments. In that event, you will not be required to submit to underwriting. Your coverage will be reinstated retroactively to the termination date but you must pay back premiums for that period. The premium will be the same as it was prior to termination.</P>
              <P>(b) If your coverage has terminated because you did not pay premiums or because you requested cancellation, the Carrier may reinstate your coverage within 12 months from the termination date at your request. You will be required to reapply based on full underwriting, and the Carrier will determine whether you are still insurable. If you are insurable, your coverage will be reinstated retroactively to the termination date and you must pay back premiums for that period. The premium will be the same as it was prior to termination.</P>

              <P>Yes, benefits will be coordinated with other plans, following the coordination of benefits (COB) guidelines set by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The total benefits from all plans that pay a long term care benefit to you should not exceed the actual costs you incur. The other plans that are considered for COB purposes include government programs, group medical benefits, and other employer-sponsored long term care insurance plans. Medicaid, individual insurance policies, and association group insurance policies are not taken into consideration under this provision.</P>

              <P>This subpart establishes OPM's policy concerning the availability and amount of CSRS and FERS annuity payments and the continuation of FEHBP and FEGLI coverage and premiums while an annuitant is classified as a missing annuitant.</P>

              <P>(a) OPM will pay an amount equal to the survivor annuity that would be payable as CSRS or FERS survivor annuity to an account in a financial institution designated (under electronic funds transfer regulations in part 209 or part 210 of Title 31, Code of Federal <PRTPAGE P="484"/>Regulations) by an individual who, if the missing annuitant were dead, would be entitled to receive payment of a survivor annuity.</P>
              <P>(b) If more than one individual would qualify for survivor annuity payments in the event of the missing annuitant's death, OPM will make separate payments in the same manner as if the missing annuitant were dead.</P>

              <P>(a) If the missing annuitant had a family enrollment, the enrollment will be transferred to the eligible family members under § 890.303(c) of this chapter. If there is only one eligible family member, the enrollment will be changed to a self-only enrollment under § 890.306(r) of this chapter. The changes will be effective the first day of the pay period following the date of disappearance.</P>
              <P>(b) If the missing annuitant was covered by a self only enrollment or if there is no eligible family member remaining, the enrollment terminates at midnight of the last day of the pay period in which he or she disappeared, subject to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion.</P>
              <P>(c) If the missing annuitant is found to be alive, the coverage held before the disappearance is reinstated effective with the pay period during which the annuitant is found, unless the annuitant, or the annuitant's representative, requests that the enrollment be restored retroactively to the pay period in which the disappearance occurred.</P>

              <P>(a) FEGLI premiums will not be collected during periods when an annuitant is a missing annuitant.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) If the annuity of a missing annuitant is restored under § 880.204(a), OPM will deduct the amount of FEGLI premiums attributable to the period when the annuitant was a missing annuitant from any adjustment payment due the annuitant under § 880.204(a).</P>
              <P>(2) If a missing annuitant is determined to be dead under § 880.205, FEGLI premiums and benefits will be computed using the date of death established under § 880.206(a).</P>

If the employee is eligible to make an election to enroll under § 890.301, such election must be made within 60 days after the later of either the date the employment with the Authority begins or the date the Authority receives his or her election to be considered a Federal employee. Employees of the Authority who are former Federal employees are subject to the provisions of § 890.303(a), except that a former Federal employee employed by the Authority before October 26, 1996, and within 3 days following the termination of the Federal <PRTPAGE P="492"/>employment may make an election to enroll under § 890.301(c). Annuitants who have continued their coverage under this part as annuitants are not eligible to enroll under this paragraph. An election to enroll under this part is effective under the provisions of § 890.306(a) unless the employee requests the Authority to make the enrollment effective on the first day of the first pay period following the date the employee entered on duty in a pay status with the Authority.</P>
              <P>(g) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, the hiring of a Federal employee, whether in pay status or nonpay status, for a temporary, intermittent position with the decennial census has no effect on the withholding or Government contribution for his/her coverage or the determination of when 365 days in nonpay status ends.</P>
              <P>(h) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, an employee who is in a position identified by OPM that provides emergency response services for wildland fire protection is eligible to be enrolled in a health benefits plan under this part.</P>
              <P>(i) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, upon request by the employing agency, OPM may grant eligibility to employees performing similar types of emergency response services to enroll in a health benefits plan under this part. In granting eligibility requests, OPM may limit the coverage of intermittent employees under a health benefits plan to the periods of time during which they are in a pay status.</P>
              <P>(j)(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, a non-Postal employee working on a temporary appointment, a non-Postal employee working on a seasonal schedule of less than 6 months in a year, or a non-Postal employee working on an intermittent schedule, for whom the employing office expects the total hours in pay status (including overtime hours) plus qualifying leave without pay hours to be at least 130 hours per calendar month, is eligible to enroll in a health benefits plan under this part as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If the employing office expects the employee to work at least 90 days, the employee is eligible to enroll upon notification of the employee's eligibility by the employing office, and</P>
              <P>(ii) If the employing office expects the employee to work for fewer than 90 days and the employee actually works for fewer than 90 days, the employee will generally be ineligible to enroll in FEHB because the employee will not be employed at the end of the waiting period applicable to these employees. However, if the expectation changes and the employee is expected to work for 90 days or more, that individual is eligible to enroll upon notification by the employing office, but enrollment (including the effective date of coverage) must be no later than the end of the waiting period ending the 91st day after the first day of employment.</P>
              <P>(2) An employee working on a temporary appointment, an employee working on a seasonal schedule of less than 6 months in a year, or an employee working on an intermittent schedule for whom the employing office expects the total hours in pay status (including overtime hours) plus qualifying leave without pay hours to be less than 130 hours per calendar month is generally ineligible to enroll in a health benefits plan under this part. If the expectation of hours of employment changes to 130 hours or more per month for a non-Postal employee, that employee is eligible to enroll in a health benefits plan under this part as described in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Once an employee is enrolled under this paragraph (j), eligibility will not be revoked, regardless of his or her actual work schedule or employer expectations in subsequent years, unless the employee separates from Federal service, receives a new appointment (in which case eligibility will be determined by the rules applicable to the new appointment), or exceeds 365 days in nonpay status in accordance with § 890.303(e) (subject to extension, if applicable, for qualifying leave without pay as defined at paragraph (j)(4) of this section).</P>

              <P>(4) For purposes of this paragraph (j), “qualifying leave without pay hours” means hours of leave without pay for purposes of taking leave under the <PRTPAGE P="493"/>Family and Medical Leave Act, for performance of duty in the uniformed services under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38 U.S.C. 4301 et seq., for receiving medical treatment under Executive Order 5396 (Jul. 7 1930), and for periods during which workers compensation is received under the Federal Employees Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. chapter 81.</P>
              <P>(5) Each temporary employee who is initially eligible for FEHB coverage on the basis of this paragraph (j) is entitled to enroll in accordance with § 890.301(a). A temporary employee who is currently eligible under 5 U.S.C. 8906a (with no Government contribution) but who is not enrolled on November 17, 2014, and who would also meet eligibility requirements on the basis of paragraph (j), is entitled to enroll (with a Government contribution) on the basis of paragraph (j) in accordance with § 890.301(h)(4)(ii). A temporary employee who is enrolled under 5 U.S.C. 8906a (with no Government contribution) on November 17, 2014, and who would also meet eligibility requirements on the basis of paragraph (j), is entitled to change enrollment (with a Government contribution) on the basis of paragraph (j) in accordance with § 890.301(h)(4)(ii).</P>
              <P>(k) The Director, upon written request of an employer of employees other than those covered by 5 U.S.C. 8901(1)(A), may, in his or her sole discretion, waive application of paragraph (j) of this section to its employees when the employer demonstrates to the Director that the waiver is necessary to avoid an adverse impact on the employer's need to manage its workforce. However, a Tribal employer participating under 25 U.S.C. 1647b may provide a written notification to the Director that it has chosen not to apply paragraph (j) of this section for its workforce.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Filing claims for payment or service.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Each health benefits carrier resolves claims filed under the plan. All health benefits claims must be submitted initially to the carrier of the covered individual's health benefits plan. If the carrier denies a claim (or a portion of a claim), the covered individual may ask the carrier to reconsider its denial. If the carrier affirms its denial or fails to respond as required by paragraph (c) of this section, the covered individual may ask OPM to review the claim. A covered individual must exhaust both the carrier and OPM review processes specified in this section before seeking judicial review of the denied claim.</P>
              <P>(2) This section applies to covered individuals and to other individuals or entities who are acting on the behalf of a covered individual and who have the covered individual's specific written consent to pursue payment of the disputed claim.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Time limits for reconsidering a claim.</E> (1) The covered individual has 6 months from the date of the notice to the covered individual that a claim (or a portion of a claim) was denied by the carrier in which to submit a written request for reconsideration to the carrier. The time limit for requesting reconsideration may be extended when the covered individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.</P>
              <P>(2) The carrier has 30 days after the date of receipt of a timely-filed request for reconsideration to:</P>
              <P>(i) Affirm the denial in writing to the covered individual;</P>
              <P>(ii) Pay the bill or provide the service; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Request from the covered individual or provider additional information needed to make a decision on the claim. The carrier must simultaneously notify the covered individual of the information requested if it requests additional information from a provider. The carrier has 30 days after the date the information is received to affirm the denial in writing to the covered individual or pay the bill or provide the service. The carrier must make its decision based on the evidence it has if the covered individual or provider does not respond within 60 days after the date of the carrier's notice requesting additional information. The carrier must then send written notice to the covered individual of its decision on the claim. The covered individual may request OPM review as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section if the carrier fails to act within the time limit set forth in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii).</P>

              <P>(3) The covered individual may write to OPM and request that OPM review the carrier's decision if the carrier either affirms its denial of a claim or fails to respond to a covered individual's written request for reconsideration within the time limit set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The <PRTPAGE P="495"/>covered individual must submit the request for OPM review within the time limit specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The carrier may extend the time limit for a covered individual's submission of additional information to the carrier when the covered individual shows he or she was not notified of the time limit or was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the additional information.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Information required to process requests for reconsideration.</E> (1) The covered individual must put the request to the carrier to reconsider a claim in writing and give the reasons, in terms of applicable brochure provisions, that the denied claim should have been approved.</P>
              <P>(2) If the carrier needs additional information from the covered individual to make a decision, it must:</P>
              <P>(i) Specifically identify the information needed;</P>
              <P>(ii) State the reason the information is required to make a decision on the claim;</P>
              <P>(iii) Specify the time limit (60 days after the date of the carrier's request) for submitting the information; and</P>
              <P>(iv) State the consequences of failure to respond within the time limit specified, as set out in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Carrier determinations.</E> The carrier must provide written notice to the covered individual of its determination. If the carrier affirms the initial denial, the notice must inform the covered individual of:</P>
              <P>(1) The specific and detailed reasons for the denial;</P>
              <P>(2) The covered individual's right to request a review by OPM; and</P>
              <P>(3) The requirement that requests for OPM review must be received within 90 days after the date of the carrier's denial notice and include a copy of the denial notice as well as documents to support the covered individual's position.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">OPM review.</E> (1) If the covered individual seeks further review of the denied claim, the covered individual must make a request to OPM to review the carrier's decision. Such a request to OPM must be made:</P>
              <P>(i) Within 90 days after the date of the carrier's notice to the covered individual that the denial was affirmed;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the carrier fails to respond to the covered individual as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, within 120 days after the date of the covered individual's timely request for reconsideration by the carrier; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Within 120 days after the date the carrier requests additional information from the covered individual, or the date the covered individual is notified that the carrier is requesting additional information from a provider. OPM may extend the time limit for a covered individual's request for OPM review when the covered individual shows he or she was not notified of the time limit or was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the request for OPM review within the time limit.</P>
              <P>(2) In reviewing a claim denied by the carrier, OPM may:</P>
              <P>(i) Request that the covered individual submit additional information;</P>
              <P>(ii) Obtain an advisory opinion from an independent physician;</P>
              <P>(iii) Obtain any other information as may in its judgment be required to make a determination; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Make its decision based solely on the information the covered individual provided with his or her request for review.</P>
              <P>(3) When OPM requests information from the carrier, the carrier must release the information within 30 days after the date of OPM's written request unless a different time limit is specified by OPM in its request.</P>
              <P>(4) Within 90 days after receipt of the request for review, OPM will either:</P>
              <P>(i) Give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual and the carrier; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Notify the individual of the status of the review. If OPM does not receive requested evidence within 15 days after expiration of the applicable time limit in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, OPM may make its decision based solely on information available to it at that time and give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual and to the carrier.</P>

              <P>(5) OPM, upon its own motion, may reopen its review if it receives evidence <PRTPAGE P="496"/>that was unavailable at the time of its original decision.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Carrier entitlement to pursue subrogation and reimbursement recoveries.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) All health benefit plan contracts shall provide that the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) carrier is entitled to pursue subrogation and reimbursement recoveries, and shall have a policy to pursue such recoveries in accordance with the terms of this section.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Any FEHB carriers' right to pursue and receive subrogation and reimbursement recoveries constitutes a condition of and a limitation on the nature of benefits or benefit payments and on the provision of benefits under the plan's coverage.</P>
              <P>(2) Any health benefits plan contract that contains a subrogation or reimbursement clause shall provide that benefits and benefit payments are extended to a covered individual on the condition that the FEHB carrier may pursue and receive subrogation and reimbursement recoveries pursuant to the contract.</P>
              <P>(c) Contracts shall provide that the FEHB carriers' rights to pursue and receive subrogation or reimbursement recoveries arise upon the occurrence of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The covered individual has received benefits or benefit payments as a result of an illness or injury; and</P>
              <P>(2) The covered individual has accrued a right of action against a third party for causing that illness or injury; or has received a judgment, settlement or other recovery on the basis of that illness or injury; or is entitled to receive compensation or recovery on the basis of the illness or injury, including from insurers of individual (non-group) policies of liability insurance that are issued to and in the name of the enrollee or a covered family member.</P>
              <P>(d) A FEHB carrier's exercise of its right to pursue and receive subrogation or reimbursement recoveries does not give rise to a claim within the meaning of 5 CFR 890.101 and is therefore not subject to the disputed claims process set forth at 5 CFR 890.105.</P>
              <P>(e) Any subrogation or reimbursement recovery on the part of a FEHB carrier shall be effectuated against the recovery first (before any of the rights of any other parties are effectuated) and is not impacted by how the judgment, settlement, or other recovery is characterized, designated, or apportioned.</P>
              <P>(f) Pursuant to a subrogation or reimbursement clause, the FEHB carrier may recover directly from any party that may be liable, or from the covered individual, or from any applicable insurance policy, or a workers' compensation program or insurance policy, all amounts available to or received by or on behalf of the covered individual by judgment, settlement, or other recovery, to the extent of the amount of benefits that have been paid or provided by the carrier.</P>
              <P>(g) Any contract must contain a provision incorporating the carrier's subrogation and reimbursement rights as a condition of and a limitation on the nature of benefits or benefit payments and on the provision of benefits under the plan's coverage. The corresponding health benefits plan brochure must contain an explanation of the carrier's subrogation and reimbursement policy.</P>
              <P>(h) A carrier's rights and responsibilities pertaining to subrogation and reimbursement under any FEHB contract relate to the nature, provision, and extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8902(m)(1). These rights and responsibilities are therefore effective notwithstanding any state or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to health insurance or plans.</P>

              <P>(c) Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) carriers resolve FEHB <PRTPAGE P="497"/>claims under authority of Federal statute (5 U.S.C. chapter 89).

A legal action to review final action by OPM involving such denial of health benefits must be brought against OPM and not against the carrier or carrier's subcontractors. The recovery in such a suit shall be limited to a court order directing OPM to require the carrier to pay the amount of benefits in dispute.</P>
              <P>(d) An action under paragraph (c) of this section to recover on a claim for health benefits:</P>

              <P>(b) The individual's failure to satisfy the eligibility requirements must be due to exceptional circumstances. An individual requesting a waiver must provide OPM with evidence that:</P>
              <P>(1) The individual intended to have FEHB coverage as an annuitant (retiree);</P>
              <P>(2) The circumstances that prevented the individual from meeting the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 8905(b) were beyond the individual's control; and</P>

Such a covered individual is treated as if he or she were a Federal employee for purposes of this part, and of any other part within this title relating to the FEHB Program.

Failure <PRTPAGE P="499"/>on the part of the carrier's plan to meet the standards is cause for OPM's withdrawal of approval of the plan in accordance with 5 CFR 890.204. A health benefits plan shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Comply with chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, and this part, as amended from time to time.</P>
              <P>(2) Accept the enrollment, in accordance with this part, and without regard to age, race, sex, health status, or hazardous nature of employment, of each eligible employee, annuitant, former spouse, former employee, or child, except that a plan that is sponsored or underwritten by an employee organization may not accept the enrollment of a person who is not a member of the organization, but it may not limit membership in the organization on account of the prohibited factors (age, race, sex, health status, or hazardous nature of employment). The carrier may terminate the enrollment of an enrollee other than a survivor annuitant, a former spouse continuing coverage under § 890.803, or person continuing coverage under § 890.1103(a) (2) or (3), in a health benefits plan sponsored or underwritten by an employee organization on account of termination of membership in the organization. A carrier that wants to terminate the enrollment of an enrollee under this paragraph may do so by notifying the employing office in writing, with a copy of the notice to the enrollee. The termination is effective at the end of the pay period in which the employing office receives the notice. A comprehensive medical plan need not enroll an employee, annuitant, former employee, former spouse, or child residing outside the geographic areas specified by the plan.</P>
              <P>(3) Provide health benefits for each enrollee and covered family member wherever they may be.</P>
              <P>(4) Provide for conversion to a contract for health benefits regularly offered by the carrier, or an appropriate affiliate, for group conversion purposes, which must be guaranteed renewable, subject to such amendments as apply to all contracts of this class, except that it may be canceled for fraud, overinsurance, or nonpayment of periodic charges. A carrier must permit conversion within the time allowed by the temporary extension of coverage provided under § 890.401 for each enrollee and covered family member entitled to convert. When an employing office gives an enrollee written notice of his or her privilege of conversion, the carrier must permit conversion at any time before 31 days after the date of notice or 91 days after the enrollment is terminated, whichever is earlier. Belated conversion opportunities as provided in § 890.401(c) must also be permitted by the carrier. When OPM requests an extension of time for conversion because of delayed determination of ineligibility for immediate annuity, the carrier must permit conversion until the date specified by OPM in its request for extension. On conversion, the contract becomes effective as of the day following the last day of the temporary extension, and the enrollee or covered family member, as the case may be, must pay the entire cost thereof directly to the carrier. The nongroup contract may not deny or delay any benefit covered by the contract for a person converting from a plan approved under this part except to the extent that benefits are continued under the health benefits plan from which he or she converts.</P>
              <P>(5) Provide that each enrollee receive an identification card or cards or other evidence of enrollment.</P>
              <P>(6) Provide a standard rate structure that contains, for each option, one standard self only rate, one standard self plus one rate and one standard self and family rate.</P>
              <P>(7) Maintain statistical records regarding the plan, separately from those of any other activities conducted or benefits offered by the carrier sponsoring or underwriting the plan.</P>

              <P>(8) Provide for a special reserve for the plan. The carrier shall account for amounts retained by it as reserves for the plan separately from reserves maintained by it for other plans. The carrier shall invest the special reserve and income derived from the investment of the special reserve shall be credited to the special reserve. If the contract is terminated or approval of the plan is withdrawn, the carrier shall return the special reserve to the Employees Health Benefits Fund. However, in the case of a comprehensive <PRTPAGE P="500"/>medical plan, the carrier, without regard to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, shall follow such financial procedures as are mutually agreed on by the carrier and OPM.</P>
              <P>(9) Provide for continued enrollment to the end of the current pay period, or termination date, if earlier, of each enrollee enrolled at the effective date of termination of a contract. The carrier is entitled to subscription charges for this continued enrollment.</P>
              <P>(10) Provide that any covered expenses incurred from January 1 to the effective date of an open season change count toward the losing carrier's prior year deductible. If the prior year deductible or family limit on deductibles of the losing carrier had previously been met, the enrolled individual (and eligible family members) shall be eligible for reimbursement by the losing carrier for covered expenses incurred during the current year. Reimbursement of covered expenses shall apply only to covered expenses incurred from January 1 to the effective date of the open season change. This section shall not apply to any other permissible changes made during a contract year.</P>
              <P>(11) Except where OPM determines otherwise, have 300 or more employees and annuitants, exclusive of family members, enrolled in the plan at some time during the preceding two contract terms.</P>
              <P>(b) To be qualified to be approved by OPM and, once approved, to continue to be approved, a health benefits plan shall not:</P>
              <P>(1) Deny a covered person a benefit provided by the plan for a service performed on or after the effective date of coverage solely because of a preexisting physical or mental condition.</P>
              <P>(2) Require a waiting period for any covered person for benefits which it provides.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Have either more than three options, or more than two options and a high deductible health plan (26 U.S.C. 223(c)(2)(A)) if the plan is described under 5 U.S.C. 8903(1), (2), (3) or (4).</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(4) Have an initiation, service, enrollment, or other fee or charge in addition to the rate charged for the plan, except that a comprehensive medical plan may impose an additional charge to be paid directly by the enrollee for certain medical supplies and services, if the supplies and services on which additional charges are imposed are clearly set forth in advance and are applicable to all enrollees. This subparagraph does not apply to charges for membership in employee organizations sponsoring or underwriting plans.</P>
              <P>(5) Paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section do not preclude a plan offering benefits for dentistry or cosmetic surgery, or both, limited to conditions arising after the effective date of coverage.</P>
              <P>(c) The Director or his or her designee will determine whether to propose withdrawal of approval of the plan and hold a hearing based on the seriousness of the carrier's actions and its proposed method to effect corrective action.</P>
              <P>(d) Nothing in this part shall limit or prevent a health insurance plan purchased through an appropriate SHOP as determined by the Director, pursuant to section 1312(d)(3)(D) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Public Law 111-152 (the Affordable Care Act or the Act), by an employee otherwise covered by 5 U.S.C. 8901(1)(B) and (C) from being considered a “health benefit plan under this chapter” for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 8905(b) and 5 U.S.C. 8906.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Application for approval of, and proposal of amendments to, health benefit plans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">New plan applications.</E> (1) The Director of OPM shall consider applications to participate in the FEHB Program from comprehensive medical plans (CMP's) at his or her discretion. CMP's are automatically invited to submit applications annually to participate in the FEHB Program unless otherwise notified by OPM. If the Director should determine that it is not beneficial to the enrollees and the Program to consider applications for a specific contract year, OPM will publish a notice with a 60 day comment period in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> no less than 7 months prior to the date applications would be due for the specific contract year for which applications will not be accepted.</P>
              <P>(2) When applications are considered, CMP's should apply for approval by writing to the Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC 20415. Application letters must be accompanied by any descriptive material, financial data, or other documentation required by OPM. Plans must submit the letter and attachments in the OPM-specified format by January 31, or another date specified by OPM, of the year preceding the contract year for which applications are being accepted. Plans must submit evidence demonstrating they meet all requirements for approval by March 31 of the year preceding the contract year for which applications are being accepted. Plans that miss either deadline cannot be considered for participation in the next contract year. All newly approved plans must submit benefit and rate proposals to OPM by May 31 of the year preceding the contract year for which applications are being accepted in order to be considered for participation in that contract year. OPM may make counter-proposals at any time.</P>
              <P>(3) OPM may approve such comprehensive medical plans as, in the judgment of OPM, may be in the best interest of enrollees in the Program. In addition to specific requirements set forth in 5 U.S.C. chapter 89, in chapter 1 and other relevant portions of title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and in other sections of this part, to be approved, an applicant plan must actually be delivering medical care at the time of application; must be in compliance with applicable State licensing and operating requirements; must not be a Federal, State, local, or territorial governmental entity; and must not be debarred, suspended, or ineligible to participate in Government contracting or subcontracting for any reason, including fraudulent health care practices in other Federal health care programs.</P>
              <P>(4) Applications must identify those individuals who have the legal authority and responsibility to enter into and guarantee contracts. The applications will be reviewed for evidence of substantial compliance with the following standards:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Health plan management:</E> Stable management with experience pertinent to the prepaid health care provider industry; sufficient operating experience to enable OPM to realistically evaluate the plan's past and expected future performance;</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Marketing:</E> A rate of enrollment that ensures equalization of income and expenses within projected timeframes and sufficient subscriber income to operate within budget thereafter; enrollment dispersed among groups such that there is not a concentration of enrollment with one or a few groups so that the loss of one or more contracts by the carrier would not jeopardize its financial viability; feasible projections of future enrollment and employer distribution, as well as the potential enrollment area for marketing purposes;</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Health care delivery system:</E> A health care delivery system providing reasonable access to and choice of quality primary and specialty medical care throughout the service area; specifically, in the individual practice setting, contractual arrangements for the services of a significant number of primary care and specialty physicians in the service area; and in the group practice setting, compliance with 5 U.S.C. 8903(4)(A) preferably demonstrated by full-time providers specializing in internal medicine, family practice, pediatrics, and obstetrics/gynecology; and</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Financial condition:</E> Establishment of firm budget projections and <PRTPAGE P="502"/>demonstrated success in meeting or exceeding those projections on a regular basis; evidence of the ability to sustain operation in the future and to meet obligations under the contract OPM might enter into with the plan; clearly specified committed funding to see the plan to an expected break-even point including a sufficient amount for unexpected contingencies; adequate current and projected funding, such as estimated premium income or commitment from a financially sound and acceptable parent organization or a mature stable entity outside the plan; insolvency protection, such as stop-loss reinsurance services and agreements with all plan providers that they will hold members harmless if, for any reason, the plan is unable to pay its providers.</P>
              <P>(5) A comprehensive medical plan that has been certified either as a qualified Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) or as a qualified Competitive Medical Plan by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at the time of application to OPM, and whose qualification status is not under investigation by HHS, will need to submit only an abbreviated application to OPM. The extent of the data and documentation to be submitted by a plan so qualified by HHS, as well as by a non-qualified plan, for a particular review cycle may be obtained by writing directly to the Office of Insurance Programs, Retirement and Insurance Service, Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC 20415.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Participating plans.</E> Changes in rates and benefits for approved health benefits plans shall be considered at the discretion of the Director of OPM. If the Director of OPM determines that it is beneficial to enrollees and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to invite health plan benefit and/or rate changes for a given contract period, a “call letter” shall be issued to the carrier approximately 9 months prior to the expiration of the current contract period. Any proposal for change shall be in writing, specifically describe the change proposed, and be signed by an authorized official of the carrier. OPM will review any requested proposal for change and will notify the carrier of its decision to accept or reject the change. OPM may make a counter proposal or at any time propose changes on its own motion. Benefits changes and rate proposals, when requested by OPM, shall be submitted not less than 7 months before the expiration of the then current contract period, unless the Director of OPM determines that a later date is acceptable. The negotiation period shall begin approximately 7 months before the expiration of the current contract period, and OPM shall seek to complete all benefit and rate negotiations no later than 4 months preceding the contract period to which they will apply. If OPM and the carrier do not reach agreement by this date, either party may give written notice of nonrenewal in accordance with § 890.205 of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withdrawal of approval of health benefits plans or carriers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Director may withdraw approval of a health benefits plan or carrier if the standards at § 890.201 of this part and 48 CFR subpart 1609.70 are not met. Such action carries with it the right to a hearing as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Before withdrawing approval, the Director or his or her representative shall notify the carrier of the plan, by certified mail, that OPM intends to withdraw approval of the health benefits plan and/or carrier. The notice shall set forth the reasons why approval is to be withdrawn. The carrier is entitled to reply in writing within 15 calendar days after its receipt of the notice, stating the reasons why approval should not be withdrawn.</P>

              <P>(2) On receipt of the reply, or in the absence of a timely reply, the Director or representative shall set a date, time, and place for a hearing. The carrier shall be notified by certified mail at least 15 calendar days in advance of the hearing. The hearing officer shall be the Director, or a representative designated by the Director, who shall not <PRTPAGE P="503"/>otherwise have been a party to the initial administrative decision to issue a letter of intent to withdraw the plan's or carrier's approval. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing unless it is waived in writing by the carrier. The carrier is entitled to appear by representative and present oral or documentary evidence, including rebuttal evidence, in opposition to the proposed action.</P>
              <P>(i) A transcribed record shall be kept of the hearing and shall be the exclusive record of the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(ii) After the hearing is held, or after OPM's receipt of the carrier's written waiver of the hearing, the Director shall make a decision on the record, taking into consideration any recommendation submitted by the hearing officer, and send it to the carrier by certified mail. A decision of the Director shall be considered a final decision for the purposes of this section. The Director, or his or her representative, may set a future effective date for withdrawal of approval.</P>
              <P>(3) The Director, or his or her representative, may give written notice of non-renewal of the contract of a carrier whose plan does not meet the minimum enrollee requirement in § 890.201(a)(11). However, the Director may defer withdrawing approval of a plan not meeting the requirement in § 890.201(a)(11) of this part when, in the judgment of OPM, the carrier shows good cause. The Director or representative may authorize a plan with fewer than 300 employees or annuitants to remain in the FEHB Program when he or she determines, in his or her discretion, that it is in the best interest of the Program (e.g., when the plan is the only plan available to enrollees in a rural area).</P>
              <P>(b) During a current contract term, the Director, in his or her discretion, may reinstate approval of a plan or carrier under this section on a finding that the reasons for withdrawing approval no longer exist.</P>

              <P>(a) Either OPM or the carrier may terminate a contract by giving a written notice of nonrenewal which includes an indication of the reason for the intended action.</P>
              <P>(b) Where termination by notice of intent not to renew is made by OPM, the carrier contesting that notice may request that OPM review the proposed decision. Such review shall be conducted by the Director or a representative designated by the Director, who shall not otherwise have been a party to the initial decision to issue a notice of intent not to renew. A request for such review, which may include a request that a representative of the carrier appear personally before OPM, shall be in writing. That request must be received within 10 calendar days of the carrier's receipt of the notice of intent not to renew. Such request shall include a detailed statement as to why the carrier disagrees with OPM's notice of nonrenewal and shall be accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation. Where a carrier has requested review under this section, the final decision by OPM not to renew a health benefits contract shall be communicated to the carrier in writing not more than 30 days after OPM's receipt of the carrier's request for review, unless a later date is mutually agreed upon.</P>
              <P>(c) In the absence of a timely request for review as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, OPM's notice of intent not to renew will become final without further notification.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial opportunity to enroll.</E> An employee who becomes eligible may elect to enroll or not to enroll within 60 days after becoming eligible.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effective date—generally.</E> Except as otherwise provided, an enrollment or change of enrollment takes effect on the first day of the first pay period <PRTPAGE P="504"/>that begins after the date the employing office receives an appropriate request to enroll or change the enrollment and that follows a pay period during any part of which the employee is in pay status.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Belated enrollment.</E> When an employing office determines that an employee was unable, for cause beyond his or her control, to enroll or change the enrollment within the time limits prescribed by this section, the employee may enroll or change the enrollment within 60 days after the employing office advises the employee of its determination.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Enrollment by proxy.</E> Subject to the discretion of the employing office, an employee's representative, having written authorization to do so, may enroll or change the enrollment for the employee.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Decreasing enrollment type.</E> (1) Subject to two exceptions, an employee may decrease enrollment type at any time. <E T="03">Exceptions:</E>
              </P>
              <P>(i) An employee participating in health insurance premium conversion may decrease enrollment type during an open season or because of and consistent with a qualifying life event as defined in part 892 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) An employee who is subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in paragraph (g)(3) of this section may not decrease enrollment type in a way that eliminates coverage of a child identified in the order as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect and the employee has at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless the employee provides documentation to the agency that he or she has other coverage for the child(ren). The employee may not elect self only as long as he or she has one child identified as covered, but may elect self plus one.</P>
              <P>(2) A decrease in enrollment type takes effect on the first day of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing office receives an appropriate request to change the enrollment, except that at the request of the enrollee and upon a showing satisfactory to the employing office that there was no family member eligible for coverage under the self plus one or self and family enrollment, or only one family member eligible for coverage under the self and family enrollment, as appropriate, the employing office may make the change effective on the first day of the pay period following the one in which there was, in the case of a self plus one enrollment, no family member or, in the case of a self and family enrollment, only one or no family member.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Open season.</E> (1) An open season will be held each year from the Monday of the second full workweek in November through the Monday of the second full workweek in December.</P>
              <P>(2) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management may modify the dates specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section or hold additional open seasons.</P>

              <P>(3) With one exception, during an open season, an eligible employee may enroll and an enrolled employee may decrease or increase enrollment type, may change from one plan or option to another, or may make any combination of these changes. <E T="03">Exception:</E> An employee who is subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in paragraph (g)(3) of this section may not cancel his or her enrollment, decrease enrollment type, or change to a comprehensive medical plan that does not serve the area where his or her child or children live as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect, and the employee has at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless the employee provides documentation to the agency that he or she has other coverage for the child(ren). The employee may not elect self only as long as he or she has one child identified as covered, but may elect self plus one.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) An open season new enrollment takes effect on the first day of the first pay period that begins in the next following year and which follows a pay period during any part of which the employee is in a pay status.</P>
              <P>(ii) An open season change of enrollment takes effect on the first day of the first pay period which begins in January of the next following year.</P>

              <P>(5) When a belated open season enrollment or change of enrollment is accepted by the employing office under <PRTPAGE P="505"/>paragraph (c) of this section, it takes effect as required by paragraph (f)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Change in family status.</E> (1) An eligible employee may enroll and an enrolled employee may decrease or increase enrollment type, change from one plan or option to another, or make any combination of these changes when the employee's family status changes, including a change in marital status or any other change in family status. The employee must enroll or change the enrollment within the period beginning 31 days before the date of the change in family status, and ending 60 days after the date of the change in family status.</P>
              <P>(2) An enrollment or change of enrollment made in conjunction with the birth of a child, or the addition of a child as a new family member in some other manner, takes effect on the first day of the pay period in which the child is born or becomes an eligible family member.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) If an employing office receives a court or administrative order on or after October 30, 2000, requiring an employee to provide health benefits for his or her child or children, the employing office will determine if the employee has a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as appropriate, in a health benefits plan that provides full benefits in the area where the child or children live. If the employee does not have the required enrollment, the agency must notify him or her that it has received the court or administrative order and give the employee until the end of the following pay period to change his or her enrollment or provide documentation to the employing office that he or she has other coverage for the child or children. If the employee does not comply within these time frames, the employing office must enroll the employee involuntarily as stated in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the employee is not enrolled or does not enroll, the agency must enroll him or her for self plus one or self and family coverage, as appropriate, in the option that provides the lower level of coverage in the Service Benefit Plan. If the employee is enrolled but does not increase the enrollment type in a way that is sufficient to cover the child or children, the employing office must change the enrollment to self plus one or self and family, as appropriate, in the same option and plan, as long as the plan provides full benefits in the area where the child or children live. If the employee is enrolled in a comprehensive medical plan that does not serve the area in which the child or children live, the employing office must change the enrollment to self plus one or self and family, as appropriate, in the option that provides the lower level of coverage in the Service Benefit Plan.</P>

              <P>(4) Subject to two exceptions, the effective date of an involuntary enrollment under paragraph (g)(3) of this section is the 1st day of the pay period that begins after the date the employing office completes the enrollment request. <E T="03">Exceptions:</E>
              </P>
              <P>(i) If the court or administrative order requires an earlier effective date, the effective date will be the 1st day of the pay period that includes that date. Effective dates may not be retroactive to a date more than 2 years earlier, or prior to October 30, 2000.</P>
              <P>(ii) If after an involuntary enrollment becomes effective and the employing office finds that circumstances beyond the employee's control prevented him or her from enrolling or changing the enrollment within the time limits in this section, the employee may change the enrollment prospectively within 60 days after the employing office advises the employee of its finding.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Change in employment status.</E> An eligible employee may enroll and an enrolled employee may decrease or increase enrollment type, change from one plan or option to another, or make any combination of these changes when the employee's employment status changes. Except as otherwise provided, an employee must enroll or change the enrollment within 60 days after the change in employment status. Employment status changes include, but are not limited to—</P>
              <P>(1) A return to pay status following loss of coverage under either—</P>

              <P>(i) Section 890.304(a)(1)(v) due to the expiration of 365 days in leave without pay (LWOP) status, or<PRTPAGE P="506"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Section 890.502(b)(5) due to the termination of coverage during LWOP status.</P>
              <P>(2) Reemployment after a break in service of more than 3 days.</P>

              <P>(iii) If one or more options of a plan are discontinued, an employee who does not change the enrollment will be enrolled in the remaining option of the plan, or in the case of a plan with two or more options remaining, the lowest-cost remaining option that is not a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP).</P>

              <P>(iv) If the discontinuance of the plan, whether permanent or temporary, is due to a disaster, an employee must change the enrollment within 60 days <PRTPAGE P="507"/>of the disaster, as announced by OPM. If an employee does not change the enrollment within the time frame announced by OPM, the employee will be enrolled in the lowest-cost nationwide plan option, as defined in paragraph (n) of this section. The effective date of enrollment changes under this provision will be set by OPM when it makes the announcement allowing such changes;</P>
              <P>(v) An employee who is unable, for causes beyond his or her control, to make an enrollment change within the 60 days following a disaster and is, as a result, enrolled in the lowest-cost nationwide plan as defined in paragraph (n) of this section, may request a belated enrollment into the plan of his or her choice subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section;</P>

The change of enrollment takes effect on the first day of the pay period that begins after the employing office receives an appropriate request.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">On becoming eligible for Medicare.</E> An employee may change the enrollment from one plan or option to another at any time beginning on the 30th day before becoming eligible for coverage under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare). A change of enrollment based on becoming eligible for Medicare may be made only once.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Salary of temporary employee insufficient to pay withholdings.</E> If the salary of a temporary employee eligible under 5 U.S.C. 8906a is not sufficient to pay the withholdings for the plan in which the employee is enrolled, the employing office shall notify the employee of the plans available at a cost that does not exceed the employee's salary. The employee may enroll in another plan whose cost is no greater than his or her salary within 60 days after receiving such notification from the employing office.

OPM reserves the right to designate an alternate plan for <PRTPAGE P="508"/>automatic enrollments if OPM determines circumstances dictate this.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Coverage of family members.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">Enrollment.</E> An enrollment for self plus one includes the enrollee and one eligible family member. An enrollment for self and family includes all family members who are eligible to be covered by the enrollment except as provided in § 890.308(h). Proof of family member eligibility may be required, and must be provided upon request, to the carrier, the employing office or OPM. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no employee, former employee, annuitant, child, or former spouse may enroll or be covered as a family member if he or she is already covered under another person's self plus one or self and family enrollment in the FEHB Program.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Dual enrollment.</E> (i) A dual enrollment exists when an individual is covered under more than one FEHB Program enrollment. Dual enrollments are prohibited except when an eligible individual would otherwise not have access to coverage and the dual enrollment has been authorized by the employing office.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> An individual described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section may enroll if he or she or his or her eligible family members would otherwise not have access to coverage, in which case the individual may enroll in his or her own right for self only, self plus one, or self and family coverage, as appropriate. However, an eligible individual is entitled to receive benefits under only one enrollment regardless of whether he or she qualifies as a family member under a spouse's or parent's enrollment. To ensure that no person receives benefits under more than one enrollment, each enrollee must promptly notify the insurance carrier as to which person(s) will be covered under his or her enrollment. These individuals are not covered under the other enrollment. Examples include but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(A) To protect the interests of married or legally separated Federal employees, annuitants, and their children, an employee or annuitant may enroll in his or her own right in a self only, self plus one, or self and family enrollment, as appropriate, even though his or her spouse also has a self plus one or self and family enrollment if the employee, annuitant, or his or her children live apart from the spouse and would otherwise not have access to coverage due to a service area restriction and the spouse refuses to change health plans.</P>
              <P>(B) When an employee who is under age 26 and covered under a parent's self plus one or self and family enrollment acquires an eligible family member, the employee may elect to enroll for self plus one or self and family coverage.</P>
              <P>(iii) Children are entitled to receive benefits under only one enrollment regardless of whether the children qualify as family members under the enrollment of both parents or of a parent and a stepparent and regardless of whether the parents are married, unmarried, divorced, or legally separated. To ensure that no person receives benefits under more than one enrollment, each enrollee must promptly notify the insurance carrier as to which family members will be covered under his or her enrollment. These individuals are not covered under the other enrollment.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) A child under the age of 26, or a child of any age who is incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability which existed before age 26, is considered to be a family member eligible to be covered by the enrollment of an enrolled employee or annuitant or a former employee or child enrolled under § 890.1103 of this part if he or she is—</P>
              <P>(i) A child born within marriage;</P>
              <P>(ii) A recognized natural child;</P>
              <P>(iii) An adopted child;</P>
              <P>(iv) A stepchild; or</P>
              <P>(v) A foster child.</P>

              <P>(2) For purposes of this part, the term “stepchild” refers to the child of an enrollee's spouse and shall continue <PRTPAGE P="509"/>to refer to such child after the enrollee's divorce from the spouse or death of the spouse, so long as the child continues to live with the enrollee in a regular parent-child relationship.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Child incapable of self-support.</E> When an individual's enrollment for self plus one or self and family includes a child who has become 26 years of age and is incapable of self-support, the employing office must require such enrollee to submit a physician's certificate verifying the child's disability. The certificate must—</P>
              <P>(1) State that the child is incapable of self-support because of a physical or mental disability that existed before the child became 26 years of age and that can be expected to continue for more than 1 year;</P>
              <P>(2) Include a statement of the name of the child, the nature of the disability, the period of time it has existed, and its probable future course and duration; and,</P>
              <P>(3) Be signed by the physician and show the physician's office address. The employing office must require the enrollee to submit the certificate on or before the date the child becomes 26 years of age. However, the employing office may accept otherwise satisfactory evidence of incapacity that is not timely filed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Renewal of certificates of incapacity.</E> The employing office must require an enrollee who has submitted a certificate of incapacity to renew that certificate on the expiration of the minimum period of disability certified.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Determination of incapacity.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the employing office shall make determinations of incapacity.</P>
              <P>(2) Either the employing office or the carrier may make a determination of incapacity if a medical condition, as specified by OPM, exists that would cause a child to be incapable of self-support during adulthood.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Switching a covered family member.</E> (1) An enrollee with a self plus one enrollment may switch his or her covered family member during the annual Open Season, upon a change in family status, upon a change in coverage, or upon a change in eligibility, so long as switching a covered family member is consistent with the event that has taken place.</P>
              <P>(2) Switching a covered family member under a self plus one enrollment will be effective on the first day of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing office receives an appropriate request to switch the covered family member.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Continuation of enrollment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">On transfer or retirement.</E> (1) Except as otherwise provided by this part, the enrollment of an employee or annuitant eligible to continue enrollment continues without change when he or she moves from one employing office to another, without a break in service of more than 3 days, whether the personnel action is designated as a transfer or not.</P>
              <P>(2) In order for an employee to continue an enrollment as an annuitant, he or she must meet the participation requirements set forth at 8905(b) of title 5, United States Code, for continuing an enrollment as an annuitant as of the commencing date of his or her annuity or monthly compensation.</P>
              <P>(3) For the purpose of this part, an employee is considered to have enrolled at his or her first opportunity if the employee enrolled during the first of the periods set forth in § 890.301 in which he or she was eligible to enroll or was covered at that time by the enrollment of another employee or annuitant, or whose enrollment was effective not later than December 31, 1964.</P>

              <P>(4) Enrollment or eligibility for enrollment under subparts H or K of this part of an individual who is not an employee eligible for coverage under other provisions of this part is not considered in determining whether a retiring employee has met the participation requirements of § 8905(b) of title 5, U.S. Code. Coverage under subparts H or K of this part of an individual who is an employee eligible for coverage under other provisions of this part may be considered in determining whether a retiring employee has met the participation requirements.<PRTPAGE P="510"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Change of enrolled employees to certain excluded positions.</E> Employees and annuitants enrolled under this part who move, without a break in service or after a separation of 3 days or less, to an employment in which they are excluded by § 890.102(c), continue to be enrolled unless excluded by paragraphs (c)(4), (5), (6), (7), or (9) of § 890.102.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">On death.</E> The enrollment of a deceased employee or annuitant who is enrolled for self plus one or self and family (as opposed to self only) is transferred automatically to his or her eligible survivor annuitant(s) covered by the enrollment, as applicable. For self and family, the enrollment is considered to be that of:</P>
              <P>(1) The survivor annuitant from whose annuity all or the greatest portion of the withholding for health benefits is made; or</P>
              <P>(2) The surviving spouse entitled to a basic employee death benefit. The enrollment covers members of the family of the deceased employee or annuitant. In those instances in which the annuity is split among surviving family members, multiple enrollments are allowed. A remarried spouse is not a member of the family of the deceased employee or annuitant unless annuity under section 8341 or 8442 of title 5, United States Code, continues after remarriage.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) <E T="03">Survivor annuitants.</E> If an employee who is entitled to health benefits coverage as a survivor annuitant elects to enroll or to continue to be enrolled under his eligibility as an employee, and is thereafter separated without entitlement to continued enrollment based on his own service, he is entitled to reinstatement of his employee-acquired enrollment on application to his retirement office. Reinstatement is effective immediately after termination of his employee-acquired enrollment if the application is received by the retirement office within 60 days of separation; otherwise reinstatement is effective on the first day of the first pay period after receipt of the application. The retirement office shall withhold from the annuity that the former employee receives as a survivor annuitant, the amounts necessary to pay his share of the cost of the enrollment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Employee becomes a survivor annuitant.</E> (i) If an employee who is entitled to health benefits coverage as a survivor annuitant elects to enroll or to continue to be enrolled under his or her eligibility as an employee, and is thereafter separated without entitlement to continued enrollment based on his or her own service, the employee is entitled to reinstatement of the enrollment as a survivor annuitant on application to the retirement office. Reinstatement as a survivor annuitant is effective on the day after the termination date of the employee-acquired enrollment if the application is received by the retirement office within 60 days of separation; otherwise, reinstatement is effective on the first day of the first pay period after receipt of the application. The retirement office shall withhold from the annuity that the former employee receives as a survivor annuitant the amounts necessary to pay the health benefits premium.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the surviving spouse of a deceased employee or annuitant is enrolled as an employee with a self plus one or self and family enrollment (or, if both the decedent and the surviving spouse were enrolled in a self only or self plus one enrollment) at the time the surviving spouse becomes a survivor annuitant and the surviving spouse is thereafter separated without entitlement to continued enrollment as a retiree, the surviving spouse is entitled to enroll as a survivor annuitant. The change from coverage as an employee to coverage as a survivor annuitant must be made within 30 days of separation from service.</P>
              <P>(iii) Except for an employee who meets the definition of former spouse under 5 U.S.C. 8901(10) based on an individual's deferred annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8341(h) or 8445(f), the employee survivor of an annuitant receiving deferred retirement benefits is not eligible for FEHB Program enrollment as a survivor annuitant and therefore may not enroll as a survivor annuitant based on coverage obtained as an employee.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Insurable interest survivor annuity.</E> A current spouse who is an insurable interest beneficiary under § 831.606(b) or § 842.605(b) of this title is eligible to continue health benefits enrollment as <PRTPAGE P="511"/>an insurable interest survivor annuitant so long as he or she was covered as a family member at the time of the annuitant's death. This entitlement applies even if the spouse is eligible for continued enrollment as a survivor annuitant under another section of 5 CFR parts 831 or 843. To prevent dual coverage, the spouse must be covered under only one health benefits enrollment under this part.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">In nonpay status.</E> (1) Except as otherwise provided by law, the enrollment of an employee continues while he/she is in nonpay status for up to 365 days. The 365 days' nonpay status may be continuous or broken by periods of less than 4 consecutive months in pay status. If an employee has at least 4 consecutive months in pay status after a period of nonpay status he/she is entitled to begin the 365 days' continuation of enrollment anew. For the purposes of this paragraph, 4 consecutive months in pay status means any 4-month period during which the employee is in pay status for at least part of each pay period.</P>
              <P>(2) However, in the case of an employee who is employed under an OPM approved career-related work-study program under Schedule D of at least one year's duration and who is expected to be in a pay status during not less than one-third of the total period of time from the date of the first appointment to the completion of the work-study program, his/her enrollment continues while he/she is in nonpay status so long as he/she is participating in the work-study program.</P>
              <P>(f) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Former spouse entitled to coverage as employee or member of family.</E> An individual entitled to health benefits as a former spouse who also has or becomes entitled to health benefits coverage as a Federal employee or as a family member under another enrollment under this part may defer or suspend coverage as a former spouse and continue his or her coverage as an employee or family member. The former spouse must have established entitlement to the health benefits coverage under § 890.803 of this part and filed all required documents with the employing office responsible for maintaining the former spouse enrollment within the time limits specified in § 890.805 of this part. The employing office shall note in the former spouse's file that the former spouse health benefits enrollment is being deferred or suspended until coverage as a Federal employee or as a family member ends. Upon loss of coverage as a Federal employee or as a family member, the individual is entitled to enroll or resume the enrollment as a former spouse, provided he or she remains eligible as such. A former spouse who enrolls because he or she lost coverage under another enrollment under this part for a reason other than cancellation must meet the requirements of § 890.301(g)(2). A former spouse who enrolls because he or she lost coverage under another enrollment under this part as a result of cancellation of the covering enrollment must meet the requirements of § 890.301(g)(4).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Temporary continuation of coverage.</E> Certain former employees who lose coverage because of a separation from Federal service, certain children who lose coverage because they cease to meet the requirements for coverage as children, and certain former spouses who lose coverage because their marriage to the enrollee ends and who are not eligible for coverage under subpart H of this part may elect temporary continuation of coverage under the provisions of subpart K of this part.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Service in the uniformed services.</E> (1) The enrollment of an individual who separates, enters military furlough, or is placed in nonpay status to serve in the uniformed services under conditions that entitle him or her to benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority, may continue for the 24-month period beginning on the date that the employee is placed on leave without pay or separated from service to perform active duty in the uniformed services, provided that the individual continues to be entitled to benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority. As provided for by 5 U.S.C. 8905(a), the continuation of enrollment for up to 24 months applies to employees called or ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation on or after September 14, 2001. The enrollment of an employee who met the requirements of chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, on or <PRTPAGE P="512"/>after December 10, 2004, may continue for the 24-month period beginning on the date that the employee is placed on leave without pay or separated from service to perform active duty in the uniformed services, provided that the employee continues to be entitled to continued coverage under part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority.</P>
              <P>(2) An employee in nonpay status is entitled to continued coverage under paragraph (e) of this section if the employee's entitlement to benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority, ends before the expiration of 365 days in nonpay status.</P>
              <P>(3) If the enrollment of an employee had terminated due to the expiration of 365 days in nonpay status or because of the employee's separation from service, it may be reinstated for the remainder of the 24-month period beginning on the date that the employee is placed on leave without pay or separated from service to perform active duty in the uniformed services, provided that the employee continues to be entitled to continued coverage under part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority.</P>

              <P>(vi) The day he or she is separated, furloughed, or placed on leave of absence to serve in the uniformed services under conditions entitling him or her to benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority, for the purpose of performing duty not limited to 30 days or less, provided the employee elects in writing to have the enrollment so terminated.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(2) If the pay of a temporary employee eligible under 5 U.S.C. 8906a is insufficient to pay the withholdings for the plan in which the employee is enrolled, and the employee does not, or cannot, elect a plan under § 890.301(l) at a cost to him or her not in excess of the pay, the employing office must terminate the employee's enrollment effective as of the end of the last period for which withholding was made. Each temporary employee whose enrollment is so terminated is entitled to a 31-day extension of coverage for conversion.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Annuitants.</E> (1) If the annuity of an annuitant is insufficient to pay the withholdings for the plan in which the annuitant is enrolled, the annuitant may elect one of the two opportunities offered under § 890.306(q) of this part (electing a plan with a withholding not in excess of the annuity; or, paying premiums directly to the retirement system in accordance with § 890.502(f) of this part). The retirement system will send two notices to the annuitant, including one by certified mail return receipt requested. Continuation of coverage rests upon electing direct payment or new coverage within 15 days (45 days for annuitants residing overseas) after receipt of the final notice. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the enrollment of an individual who fails to make an election within the specified time frame will be terminated. An annuitant whose enrollment is terminated because of failure to make an election may not reenroll or reinstate coverage, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Each annuitant whose enrollment is so terminated is entitled to a 31-day extension of coverage for conversion.</P>
              <P>(2) If the individual was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making an election within the time limit after receipt of the final notice, he or she may request reinstatement of coverage by writing to the retirement system. The retirement system will determine if the individual is eligible for reinstatement of coverage; and, when the determination is affirmative, the individual's coverage may be reinstated retroactively to the date of termination or prospectively. If the determination is negative, the individual may request reconsideration of the decision from OPM.</P>
              <P>(3) If the annuitant does not make an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and is enrolled in the high option of a plan that has two options, the annuitant is deemed to have elected enrollment in the standard option of the same plan unless the annuity is insufficient to pay the withholdings for the standard option.</P>
              <P>(4) An annuitant's enrollment terminates, subject to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion, at midnight of the last day of the pay period in which he dies, unless he leaves a member of the family entitled to continue enrollment as a survivor annuitant, or, if his enrollment is not terminated by death, at midnight of the earliest of the following dates:</P>
              <P>(i) The last day of the last pay period for which he is entitled to annuity, unless he is eligible for continued enrollment as an employee in which case his enrollment continues without change.</P>
              <P>(ii) The last day of the pay period in which his title to compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, terminates, or in which he is held by the Secretary of Labor to be able to return to duty, unless he is eligible for continued enrollment as an employee or as an annuitant under a retirement system for civilian employees in which case his enrollment continues without change.</P>
              <P>(iii) The day he enters on active duty in a uniformed service for the purpose of performing duty not limited to 30 days or less, provided the annuitant elects, in writing, to terminate the enrollment.</P>

              <P>(1) The day on which he or she ceases to be a family member;</P>

              <P>(2) The day the enrollee ceases to be enrolled, unless the family member is <PRTPAGE P="514"/>entitled, as a survivor annuitant, to continued enrollment, or is entitled to continued coverage under the enrollment of another.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Cancellation or suspension.</E> (1)(i) An employee who participates in health insurance premium conversion as provided in part 892 of this chapter may cancel his or her enrollment only during an open season or because of and consistent with a qualifying life event defined in § 892.101 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d)(iii) of this section, an enrollee who does not participate in premium conversion may cancel his or her enrollment at any time by filing an appropriate request with the employing office. The cancellation is effective at the end of the last day of the pay period in which the employing office receives the appropriate request canceling the enrollment.</P>
              <P>(iii) An employee who is subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in § 890.301(g)(3), or an annuitant who was subject to such a court or administrative order at the time of his or her retirement, may not cancel or suspend his or her enrollment as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect and the enrollee has at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless the employee or annuitant provides documentation to the agency that he or she has other coverage for the child or children.</P>
              <P>(2) An annuitant or survivor annuitant may suspend enrollment in FEHB for the purpose of enrolling in a Medicare-sponsored plan under sections 1833, 1876, or 1851 of the Social Security Act, or to enroll in the Medicaid program or a similar State-sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy, or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including coverage provided by the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life instead of FEHB coverage. To suspend FEHB coverage, documentation of eligibility for coverage under the non-FEHB program must be submitted to the retirement system. If the documentation is received within the period beginning 31 days before and ending 31 days after the effective date of the enrollment in the Medicare-sponsored plan, or the Medicaid or similar program, or within 31 days before or after the day designated by the annuitant or survivor annuitant as the day he or she wants to suspend FEHB coverage to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life instead of FEHB coverage, then suspension will be effective at the end of the day before the effective date of the enrollment or the end of the day before the day designated. Otherwise, the suspension is effective the first day of the first pay period that begins after the date the retirement system receives the documentation.</P>
              <P>(3) The enrollee and covered family members are not entitled to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion or to convert to an individual contract for health benefits.</P>

              <P>(a) The enrollment of an employee or annuitant whose enrollment was terminated under § 890.304(a)(1)(vi), (vii), or (viii) or § 890.304(b)(4)(iii) is automatically reinstated on the day the employee is restored to a civilian position under the provisions of part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority, or on the day the annuitant is separated from the uniformed services, as the case may be.</P>

              <P>(b) An employee whose employing office terminates his or her enrollment because his or her order to enter on duty in a uniformed service is for a period longer than 30 days, and who retires on an immediate annuity from his or her Federal civilian position while on such duty, may reinstate his or her enrollment by asking to do so within 60 days after retirement. In the absence of such a request, the retirement system <PRTPAGE P="515"/>automatically reinstates the enrollment on the day the person separates from the uniformed service. For the retirement system to reinstate the enrollment, the individual must have been covered under this part since his or her first opportunity or for the 5 years of civilian service (excluding the period of uniformed service) immediately preceding the civilian retirement, whichever is shorter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When can annuitants or survivor annuitants change enrollment or reenroll and what are the effective dates?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements to continue coverage.</E> (1) To be eligible to continue coverage in a plan under this part, a former employee in receipt of an annuity must meet the statutory requirements under 5 U.S.C. 8905(b) of having retired on an immediate annuity and having been covered by a plan under this part for the 5 years of service immediately before retirement, or if less than 5 years, for all service since his or her first opportunity to enroll, unless OPM waives the requirement under § 890.108.</P>
              <P>(2) To be eligible to continue coverage in a plan under this part, a survivor annuitant must be covered as a family member when the employee or annuitant dies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effective date—generally.</E> Except as otherwise provided, an annuitant's change of enrollment takes effect on the first day of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing office receives an appropriate request to change the enrollment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Belated enrollment.</E> When an employing office determines that an annuitant was unable, for cause beyond his or her control, to continue coverage by enrolling in his or her own name or change the enrollment within the time limits prescribed by this section, the annuitant may do so within 60 days after the employing office advises the annuitant of its determination.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Enrollment by proxy.</E> Subject to the discretion of the employing office, an annuitant's representative, having written authorization to do so, may continue the annuitant's coverage by enrolling in the annuitant's own name, or change the enrollment for the annuitant.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Decreasing enrollment type.</E> (1) With one exception, an annuitant may decrease enrollment type at any time. Exception: An annuitant who, as an employee, was subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in § 890.301(g)(3) at the time he or she retired may not, after retirement, decrease enrollment type in a way that eliminates coverage of a child identified in the order as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect and the annuitant has at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless the annuitant provides documentation to the retirement system that he or she has other coverage for the child or children. The annuitant may not elect self only as long as he or she has one child identified as covered, but may elect self plus one.</P>
              <P>(2) A decrease in enrollment type takes effect on the first day of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing office receives an appropriate request to change the enrollment, except that at the request of the annuitant and upon a showing satisfactory to the employing office that there was no family member eligible for coverage under the self plus one or self and family enrollment, or only one family member eligible for coverage under the self and family enrollment, as appropriate, the employing office may make the change effective on the first day of the pay period following the one in which there was, in the case of a self plus one enrollment, no family member or, in the case of a self and family enrollment, only one or no family member.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Open season.</E> (1) During an open season as provided by § 890.301(f)—</P>

              <P>(i) With one exception, an enrolled annuitant may decrease or increase enrollment type, may change from one plan or option to another, or may make any combination of these changes. Exception: An annuitant who, as an employee, was subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in § 890.301(g)(3) at the time he or she retired may not cancel or suspend his or her enrollment, decrease enrollment <PRTPAGE P="516"/>type in a way that eliminates coverage of a child identified in the order or change to a comprehensive medical plan that does not serve the area where his or her child or children live after retirement as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect and the annuitant has at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless the annuitant provides documentation to the retirement system that he or she has other coverage for the child or children. The annuitant may not elect self only as long as he or she has one child identified as covered, but may elect self plus one.</P>
              <P>(ii) An annuitant or survivor annuitant who suspended enrollment under this part to enroll in a Medicare-sponsored plan under sections 1833, 1876, or 1851 of the Social Security Act, or to enroll in a Medicaid or similar State-sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy, or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life coverage instead of FEHB coverage, may reenroll.</P>
              <P>(2) An open season reenrollment or change of enrollment takes effect on the first day of the first pay period that begins in January of the next following year.</P>
              <P>(3) When a belated open season reenrollment or change of enrollment is accepted by the employing office under paragraph (c) of this section, it takes effect as required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Change in family status.</E> (1) An enrolled former employee in receipt of an annuity may decrease or increase enrollment type, change from one plan or option to another, or make any combination of these changes when the annuitant's family status changes, including a change in marital status or any other change in family status. In the case of an enrolled survivor annuitant, a change in family status based on additional family members occurs only if the additional family members are family members of the deceased employee or annuitant. The annuitant must change the enrollment within the period beginning 31 days before the date of the change in family status, and ending 60 days after the date of the change in family status.</P>
              <P>(2) A change of enrollment made in conjunction with the birth of a child, or the addition of a child as a new family member in some other manner, takes effect on the first day of the pay period in which the child is born or becomes an eligible family member.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Reenrollment of annuitants or survivor annuitants who suspended enrollment to enroll in a Medicare-sponsored plan, or a Medicaid or similar State-sponsored program; or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life coverage instead of FEHB coverage.</E>  (1) An annuitant or survivor annuitant who had been enrolled (or was eligible to enroll) for coverage under this part and suspended the enrollment for the purpose of enrolling in a Medicare sponsored plan under sections 1833, 1876, or 1851 of the Social Security Act, or to enroll in the Medicaid program or a similar State-sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy, or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life coverage instead of the FEHB Program (as provided by § 890.304(d)), and who subsequently involuntarily loses coverage under one of these programs, may immediately reenroll in any available FEHB plan under this part at any time beginning 31 days before and ending 60 days after the loss of coverage. A reenrollment under this paragraph (h) of this section takes effect on the date following the effective date of the loss of coverage as shown on the documentation from the non-FEHB coverage. If the request to reenroll is not received by the retirement system within the time period specified, the annuitant must wait until the next available Open Season to reenroll.</P>

              <P>(2) An annuitant or survivor annuitant who suspended enrollment in the FEHB Program to enroll in a Medicare sponsored plan or the Medicaid or similar State-sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy, or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life, but now wants to <PRTPAGE P="517"/>reenroll in the FEHB Program for any reason other than an involuntary loss of coverage, may do so during the next available Open Season (as provided by paragraph (f) of this section).</P>

If such former employee dies before the end of this 60-day election period, a survivor who is entitled to a survivor annuity may enroll in a health benefits plan under this part within 60 days after OPM mails the survivor a notice of eligibility.</P>
              <P>(2) The former employee's enrollment takes effect on the first day of the month following the month in which OPM receives the appropriate request or on the commencing date of annuity, whichever is later. A survivor's enrollment takes effect on the first day of the month following the month in which OPM receives the appropriate request.</P>

The enrollment takes effect on the first day of the pay period after the date OWCP receives the appropriate request.</P>

              <P>(l) <E T="03">Loss of coverage under this part or under another group insurance plan.</E> An annuitant who meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, and who is not enrolled but is covered by another enrollment under this part may continue coverage by enrolling in his or her own name when the annuitant loses coverage under the other enrollment under this part. An enrolled annuitant may decrease or increase enrollment type, change from one plan or option to another, or make any combination of these changes when the annuitant or an eligible family member of the annuitant loses coverage under this part or under another group health benefits plan. Except as otherwise provided, an annuitant must enroll or change the enrollment within the period beginning 31 days before the date of loss of coverage and ending 60 days after the date of loss of coverage. Losses of coverage include, but are not limited to—</P>

If the discontinuance is at a time other than the end of the contract year, OPM must establish a time and effective date for the annuitant to change the enrollment;</P>
              <P>(ii) If a plan discontinues all of its existing options, an annuitant who does not change his or her enrollment is deemed to have enrolled in the lowest-cost nationwide plan option, as defined in § 890.301(n); except when the annuity is insufficient to pay the withholdings, then paragraph (q) of this section applies.</P>
              <P>(iii) If one or more options of a plan are discontinued, an annuitant who does not change the enrollment will be enrolled in the remaining option of the plan, or in the case of a plan with two or more options remaining, the lowest-cost remaining option that is not a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP).

The effective date of enrollment changes under this provision will be set by OPM when it makes the announcement allowing such changes;</P>

              <P>(vi) An annuitant who is unable, for causes beyond his or her control, to make an enrollment change within the 60 days following a disaster and is, as a result, enrolled in the lowest-cost nationwide plan as defined in § 890.301(n), may request a belated enrollment into the plan of his or her choice subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="519"/>

              <SUBJECT>Waiver or suspension of annuity or compensation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (f) of this section, when annuity or compensation is entirely waived or suspended, the annuitant's enrollment continues for not more than 3 months (not more than 12 weeks for annuitants whose compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, is paid each 4 weeks). If the waiver or suspension continues beyond this period, the employing office will notify the annuitant in writing that the employing office will terminate the enrollment effective at the end of the period, subject to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion, unless the annuitant elects to make payment of the premium directly to the employing office during the period of waiver. If the annuitant elects to have the enrollment terminated, the employing office automatically reinstates the enrollment on a prospective basis when the annuitant again receives payment of annuity or compensation. The employing office will make the withholding for the period of waiver or suspension during which enrollment was continued (i.e., 3 months or less).</P>

              <P>(b) If the annuitant elects to pay premiums directly, he or she must send to the employing office his or her share of the subscription charge for the enrollment for every pay period during which the enrollment continues, exclusive of the 31-day temporary extension of coverage for conversion provided in § 890.401. The annuitant must pay after each pay period he or she is covered in accordance with a schedule established by the employing office. If the employing office does not receive payment by the date due, the employing office must notify the annuitant in writing that continuation of coverage depends upon payment being made within 15 days (45 days for annuitants residing <PRTPAGE P="521"/>overseas) after receipt of the notice. If no further payments are made, the employing office terminates the enrollment 60 days after the date of the notice (90 days for annuitants residing overseas). The employing office automatically reinstates enrollment on a prospective basis when payment of annuity or compensation resumes.</P>
              <P>(c) If the annuitant is prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from paying within 15 days after receipt of the notice, he or she may request reinstatement of coverage by writing to the employing office. The annuitant must file the request within 30 calendar days from the date of termination, and must include supporting documentation. The employing office will determine if the annuitant is eligible for reinstatement of coverage; and, when the determination is affirmative, reinstate the coverage of the annuitant retroactive to the date of termination. If the determination is negative, the annuitant may request a review of the decision as provided in § 890.104.</P>
              <P>(d) Termination of enrollment for failure to pay premiums within the time frame established in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section is retroactive to the end of the last pay period for which the employing office timely received payment.</P>
              <P>(e) The employing office will submit all direct premium payments along with its regular health benefits premiums to OPM in accordance with procedures established by OPM.</P>
              <P>(f) If suspension of annuity or compensation is because of reemployment, the reemploying office must make the withholding currently and enrollment continues during reemployment.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Carrier disenrollment: Enrollment reconciliation.</E> (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a carrier that cannot reconcile its record of an individual's enrollment with agency enrollment records or does not receive documentation necessary to resolve the discrepancy from the employing office within 31 days of a request must provide written notice to the individual that the employing office of record does not show him or her as enrolled in the carrier's plan and that he or she will be disenrolled 31 calendar days after the date of the notice unless the enrollee provides appropriate documentation to resolve the discrepancy. Appropriate documentation includes, but is not limited to, a copy of the Standard Form 2809 (basic enrollment document) (or a letter confirming an electronic transaction), the Standard Form 2810 transferring the enrollment into the gaining employing office (or the equivalent electronic submission), copies of earnings and leave statements or annuity statements showing withholdings for the health benefits plan, or a document or other credible information from the enrollee's employing office stating that the individual is entitled to continued enrollment in the plan and that the premiums are being paid. After receiving documentation from the enrollee, the carrier must notify both the enrollee and the employing office of record of their decision on the information.</P>
              <P>(2) If the carrier does not receive documentation required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section within the specified time frame, the carrier should disenroll the individual, without further notice.</P>

              <P>(4) A request for reconsideration of the carrier's decision must be filed within 60 calendar days after the date of the carrier's disenrollment notice. The time limit on filing may be extended when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by <PRTPAGE P="522"/>circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.</P>
              <P>(5) After reconsideration, the employing office must issue a written notice of its final decision to the individual and notify the carrier of the decision. The notice must fully set forth the findings and conclusions on which the decision was based. If upon reconsideration the employing office determines the individual is entitled to continued enrollment in the plan, the disenrollment under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is void and coverage is reinstated retroactively.</P>
              <P>(6) If, at any time after the disenrollment has occurred, the employing office or OPM determines that another section of this part applies to the individual's enrollment or the carrier discovers or receives appropriate documentation showing that another section of this part applies to the individual's enrollment, the disenrollment under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is void and coverage is reinstated retroactively.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Carrier disenrollment: Death of enrollee.</E> When a carrier receives, from any reliable source, information of the death of an enrollee with a self only enrollment, the carrier may take action to disenroll the individual on the date set forth in § 890.304(a)(1)(iv) or § 890.304(b)(4), as appropriate. When the date of death is unknown, the carrier may take action to disenroll the individual on the date which is the last day of the pay period in which information of the death is received. Reliable sources include, but are not limited to, claims for hospital or physician costs incurred at time of death and correspondence returned from the Postal Service noting that the addressee is deceased. If, at any time after the disenrollment has occurred, the employing office or OPM determines that another section of this part applies to the individual's enrollment or the carrier discovers or receives appropriate documentation showing that another section of this part applies to the individual's enrollment, the disenrollment under this paragraph (b) is void and coverage is reinstated retroactively.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Carrier disenrollment: Child survivor annuitant.</E> (1) When a child survivor annuitant covered under a self only enrollment reaches age 22, the carrier may take action to disenroll the individual effective with the date set forth in § 890.304(c)(1) unless records with the carrier indicate that the child is incapable of self support due to a physical or mental disability. The carrier must provide the enrollee with a written notice of disenrollment prescribed or approved by OPM prior to the date set forth in § 890.304(c)(1).</P>
              <P>(2) The child survivor annuitant may request the retirement system to reconsider the carrier's decision to disenroll the individual. The request for reconsideration must be made in writing and include the enrollee's name, address, Social Security Number or other identifier, name of carrier, reason(s) for the request, and the survivor annuity claim number. The retirement system must notify the carrier when a request for reconsideration of the carrier's decision to disenroll the individual is made.</P>
              <P>(3) A request for reconsideration of the carrier's decision must be filed with the retirement system within 60 calendar days from the date of the carrier's disenrollment notice. The time limit on filing may be extended when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.</P>
              <P>(4) After reconsideration, the retirement system must issue a written notice of its final decision to the child survivor annuitant and notify the carrier of the decision. The notice must fully set forth the findings and conclusions on which the decision was based. If upon reconsideration the retirement system determines that he or she is entitled to continued enrollment in the plan, the disenrollment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is void and coverage is reinstated retroactively.</P>

              <P>(5) If, at any time after the disenrollment has occurred, the employing office or OPM determines that another provision of this part applies to the individual's enrollment or the carrier discovers or receives appropriate documentation showing that another section of this part applies to the <PRTPAGE P="523"/>individual's enrollment, the disenrollment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is void and coverage is reinstated retroactively.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Carrier disenrollment: Separation from Federal employment.</E> When an enrollee notifies the carrier that he or she has separated from Federal employment and is no longer eligible for enrollment, the carrier must disenroll the individual on the last day of the pay period in which the separation occurred, if known, otherwise the carrier must disenroll the employee on the date the employee provides as the date of separation. The carrier must provide the enrollee with a written notice of disenrollment prescribed or approved by OPM.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Carrier removal from enrollment: Ineligible individuals.</E> (1) A carrier may request verification of eligibility from the enrollee at any time of an individual who is covered as a family member of the enrollee in accordance with § 890.302. To verify eligibility, the carrier shall send the enrollee a request for appropriate documentation of the individual's relationship to the enrollee with a copy to the enrollee's employing office of record. The request shall contain a written notice that the individual will no longer be covered 60 calendar days after the date of the notice unless the enrollee or the employing office provides appropriate documentation as requested. If the carrier does not receive the requested documentation within the specified time frame or if based on the documentation provided the individual is found not to be eligible, the carrier shall remove the individual from the enrollment and shall provide written notice of removal to the enrollee, with a copy to the employing office, including an explanation of the process for seeking reconsideration. The carrier may extend the time limit to provide appropriate documentation if the enrollee or the removed individual shows to the carrier that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from providing timely documentation.</P>
              <P>(2) Appropriate documentation includes, but is not limited to, copies of birth certificates, marriage certificates, and, if applicable, other proof including that the individual lives with the enrollee and the enrollee is the individual's primary source of financial support.</P>
              <P>(3) The effective date of a removal shall be prospective unless the record shows that the enrollee or the removed individual has committed fraud or made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact as prohibited by the terms of the plan. If fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact is found, the effective date of the removal is the date of loss of eligibility.</P>
              <P>(4) A request for reconsideration of the carrier's initial decision must be filed by the enrollee or the removed individual with the enrollee's employing office within 60 calendar days after the date of the carrier's initial decision.

The enrollee does not remove the former spouse from the enrollee's self and family enrollment, so the former spouse is receiving coverage but is not eligible. In this example, the former spouse is not eligible to receive an annuity listed in § 890.805(2). If the employing office later discovers the divorce, and removes the spouse from the enrollment on June 20, 2018, the former spouse is not eligible for a 31-day extension of coverage, conversion and/or temporary continuation of coverage because the regulatory window for election of 60 days outlined in § 890.805(1) has passed. The sixty-day window began on the final date of the divorce, May 4, 2017 and ended on July 3, 2017.</P>

The enrollee shall also provide the last known contact information for the child.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of a child who has reached the age of majority in the child's state of residence, if the child provides a notarized request for removal to the employing office.</P>
              <P>(2) For removals under paragraph (h)(1) of this section the effective date is the first day of the third pay period following the date the request is approved by the employing office for employees who pay bi-weekly and the second pay period following the date that the request is approved by the employing office for enrollees who pay premiums monthly.</P>
              <P>(3) The family member's removal under this paragraph (h) is considered a cancellation under § 890.304(d) and removed family members are not eligible for temporary extension of coverage and conversion under § 890.401 or temporary continuation of coverage under § 809.1103.</P>
              <P>(4) If an eligible family member is removed under this paragraph (h), he or she may only regain coverage under the applicable self plus one or self and family enrollment if requested by the enrollee during the annual open season or within 60 days of the family member losing other health insurance coverage. The enrollee must also provide written consent to reinstatement of coverage from the family member and demonstrate eligibility of the spouse or child as a family member to the employing office.</P>

              <P>(2) Termination of an enrollment under this subpart for failure to pay premiums is considered a cancellation of the enrollment for the purposes of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Continuation of benefits.</E> (1) Any person who has been granted a 31-day extension of coverage in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and who is confined in a hospital or other institution for care or treatment on the 31st day of the temporary extension is entitled to continuation of the benefits of the plan during the continuance of the confinement but not beyond the 60th day after the end of the temporary extension.</P>
              <P>(2) Except when a plan is discontinued in whole or in part or the Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance orders an enrollment change, a person whose enrollment has been changed from one plan to another, or from one option of a plan to the other option of that plan, and who is confined to a hospital or other institution for care or treatment on the last day of enrollment under the prior plan or option, is entitled to continuation of the benefits of the prior plan or option during the continuance of the confinement. Continuation of benefits shall not extend beyond the 91st day after the last day of enrollment in the prior plan or option. The plan or option to which enrollment has been changed shall not pay benefits with respect to that person while he or she is entitled to any inpatient benefits under the prior plan or option. The gaining plan or option shall begin coverage according to the limits of its FEHB Program contract on the day after the day all inpatient benefits have been exhausted under the prior plan or option or the 92nd day after the last day of enrollment in the prior plan or option, whichever is earlier. For the purposes of this paragraph, “exhausted” means paid or provided to the maximum benefit available under the contract.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Exception.</E> The limit on the number of confinement days allowed to be covered under the continuation of benefits specified by paragraph (b)(2) of this subpart does not apply to confinements in a hospital or other institution when the charges and benefit payments for the services provided are covered by the limit specified in subpart I of this part. In these cases, the benefits continue until the end of the confinement.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) The employing agency must notify the enrollee of the termination of the enrollment and of the right to convert to an individual policy within 60 days after the date the enrollment terminates.</P>
              <P>(2) The individual whose enrollment terminates must request conversion information from the losing carrier within 31 days of the date of the agency notice of the termination of the enrollment and of the right to convert.</P>
              <P>(3) When an agency fails to provide the notification required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section within 60 days of the date the enrollment terminates, or the individual fails for other reasons beyond his or her control to request conversion as required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, he or she may request conversion to an individual policy by writing directly to the carrier. Such a request must be filed within 6 months after the individual became eligible to convert his or her group coverage and must be accompanied by verification of termination of the enrollment; e.g., an SF 50, showing the individual's separation from the service. In addition, the individual must show that he or she was not notified of the termination of the enrollment and of the right to convert, and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was unable, for cause beyond his or her control, to convert. The carrier will determine if the individual is eligible to convert; and when the determination is affirmative, the individual may convert within 31 days of the determination. If the determination by the carrier is negative, the individual may request a review of the carrier's determination from OPM.</P>

              <P>(4) When an individual converts his or her coverage anytime after the group coverage has ended, the individual plan coverage is retroactive to the day following the day the temporary extension of group coverage ended. The individual must pay the premiums due for the retroactive period.<PRTPAGE P="527"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) An individual who fails to exercise his or her rights to convert to an individual policy within 31 days after receiving notice of the right to convert from the carrier is deemed to have declined the right to convert unless the carrier, or, upon review, OPM determines the failure was for cause beyond his or her control.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Government contributions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Government contribution toward subscription charges under all health benefits plans, for each enrolled employee who is paid biweekly, is the amount provided in section 8906 of title 5, United States Code, plus 4 percent of that amount.</P>
              <P>(b) In accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8906(a) which take effect with the contract year that begins in January 1999, OPM will determine the amounts representing the weighted average of subscription charges in effect for each contract year, for self only, self plus one, and self and family enrollments, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The determination of the weighted average of subscription charges will only include those health benefits plans which are continuing FEHB Program participation from one contract year to the next.</P>
              <P>(i) If OPM and the carrier for a plan that will continue participation have closed negotiations on rates for the upcoming contract year by September 1 of the current contract year, i.e., the determination year, OPM will use the plan's negotiated subscription charges for the upcoming contract year in the determination of the weighted average of subscription charges.</P>
              <P>(ii) If OPM and the carrier for a plan that applied to continue participation have not closed rate negotiations for the upcoming contract year by September 1 of the determination year, OPM will make a deemed adjustment to such plan's subscription charges for the current contract year for purposes of counting eligible enrollees of the plan in the determination of weighted average charges for the upcoming contract year. The deemed adjustment will equal any increase or decrease OPM finds in its determination of the weighted average of subscription charges for the upcoming contract year for all plans with which OPM has closed rates on September 1 of the determination year.</P>
              <P>(iii) There will be no subsequent adjustment in the weighted average charges applicable to the upcoming contract year to reflect rate negotiations closed after September 1 of the determination year.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as otherwise specified in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the weight OPM gives to each subscription charge for purposes of determining the weighted average of subscription charges for the upcoming contract year will be proportionate to the number of individuals who, as of March 31 of the determination year, are enrolled in the plan or benefits option to which such charge applies and are eligible for a Government health benefits contribution in the upcoming contract year.</P>
              <P>(i) When a subscription charge for an upcoming contract year applies to a plan that is the result of a merger of two or more plans which contract separately with OPM during the determination year, or applies to a plan which will cease to offer two benefits options, OPM will combine the self only enrollments, the self plus one enrollments, and the self and family enrollments from the merging plans, or from a plan's benefits options, for purposes of weighting subscription charges in effect for the successor plan for the upcoming contract year.</P>

              <P>(ii) When a comprehensive medical plan (CMP) varies subscription charges <PRTPAGE P="528"/>for different portions of the plan's service area and the plan's contract for the upcoming contract year will reconfigure geographic areas associated with subscription charges, so that there will not be a direct correlation between enrollment in the determination year and rating areas for the upcoming contract year, OPM will estimate what portion of the plan's enrollees on March 31 of the determination year will be subject to each of the plan's subscription rates for the upcoming contract year.</P>
              <P>(3) After OPM weights each subscription charge as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, OPM will compute the total of subscription charges associated with self only enrollments, self plus one enrollments, and self and family enrollments, respectively. OPM will divide each subscription charge total by the total number of enrollments such amount represents to obtain the program-wide weighted average subscription charges for self only and for self plus one and self and family enrollments, respectively.</P>
              <P>(c) The Government contribution for annuitants and for employees who are not paid biweekly is a percentage of that fixed by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section proportionate to the length of the pay period, rounding fractions of a cent to the nearest cent.</P>
              <P>(d) The Government contribution for employees whose annual pay is paid during a period shorter than 52 workweeks is determined on an annual basis and prorated over the number of installments of pay regularly paid during the year.</P>
              <P>(e) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, the employing office must make a contribution for an employee for each pay period during which the enrollment continues.</P>
              <P>(f) Temporary employees enrolled under 5 U.S.C. 8906a must pay the full subscription charge including the Government contribution. Employees with provisional appointments under § 316.403 of this chapter are not considered to be enrolled under 5 U.S.C. 8906a for the purposes of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(g) The Government contribution for an employee who enters the uniformed services and whose enrollment continues under § 890.303(i) ceases after 365 days in nonpay status.</P>
              <P>(h) The Government contribution for an employee who enrolls in a health benefit plan offered through an appropriate SHOP as determined by the Director pursuant to section 1312(d)(3)(D) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Public Law 111-152 (the Affordable Care Act or the Act) shall be calculated in the same manner as for other employees.</P>
              <P>(2) Government contributions and employee withholdings for employees who enroll in a health benefit plan offered through an appropriate SHOP as determined by the Director, pursuant to section 1312(d)(3)(D) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Public Law 111-152 (the Affordable Care Act or the Act) shall be accounted for pursuant to section 8909 of title 5 and such monies shall only be available for payment of premiums, and costs in accordance with section 8909(a)(2) of title 5.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withholdings, contributions, LWOP, premiums, and direct premium payment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Employee and annuitant withholdings and contributions.</E> (1) Employees and annuitants are responsible for paying the enrollee share of the cost of enrollment for every pay period during which they are enrolled. An employee or annuitant incurs a debt to the United States in the amount of the proper employee or annuitant withholding required for each pay period during which they are enrolled if the appropriate health benefits withholdings or direct premium payments are not made.</P>

              <P>(2) An individual is not required to pay withholdings for the period between the end of the pay period in <PRTPAGE P="529"/>which he or she separates from service and the commencing date of an immediate annuity, if later.</P>
              <P>(3) Temporary employees who are eligible to enroll under 5 U.S.C. 8906a must pay the full subscription charges including both the employee share and the Government contribution. Employees with provisional appointments under § 316.403 of this chapter are not considered eligible for coverage under 5 U.S.C. 8906a for the purpose of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(4) The employing office must calculate the withholding for employees whose annual pay is paid during a period shorter than 52 workweeks on an annual basis and prorate the withholding over the number of installments of pay regularly paid during the year.</P>
              <P>(5) The employing office must make the withholding required from enrolled survivor annuitants in the following order. First, withhold from the annuity of a surviving spouse, if there is one. If that annuity is less than the amount required, withhold to the extent necessary from the annuity of the youngest child, and if necessary, from the annuity of the next older child, in succession, until the withholding is met.</P>
              <P>(6) Surviving spouses who have a basic employee death benefit under 5 U.S.C. 8442(b)(1)(A) and annuitants whose health benefits premiums are more than the amount of their annuities may pay their portion of the health benefits premium directly to the retirement system acting as their employing office, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures when an employee enters a leave without pay (LWOP) status or pay is insufficient to cover premium.</E> The employing office must tell the employee about available health benefits choices as soon as it becomes aware that an employee's premium payments cannot be made because he or she will be or is already in a leave without pay (LWOP) status or any other type of nonpay status. (This does not apply when nonpay is as a result of a lapse of appropriations.) The employing office must also tell the employee about available choices when an employee's pay is not enough to cover the premiums.</P>
              <P>(1) The employing office must give the employee written notice of the choices and consequences as described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section and will send a letter by first class mail if it cannot give it to the employee directly. If it mails the notice, it is deemed to be received within 5 days.</P>
              <P>(2) The employee must elect in writing to either continue health benefits coverage or terminate it. (Exception: An employee who is subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in § 890.301(g)(3) cannot elect to terminate his or her enrollment as long as the court/administrative order is still in effect and the employee has at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless the employee provides documentation that he or she has other coverage for the child(ren).) The employee may continue coverage by choosing one of the following ways to pay and returning the signed form to the employing office within 31 days after he or she receives the notice (45 days for an employee residing overseas). When an employee mails the signed form, its postmark will be used as the date the form is returned to the employing office. If an employee elects to continue coverage, he or she must elect in writing one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Pay the premium directly to the agency and keep the payments current. The employee must also agree that if he or she does not pay the premiums currently, the employing office will recover the amount of accrued unpaid premiums as a debt under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the employee does not wish to pay the premium directly to the agency and keep payments current, he or she may agree that upon returning to employment or upon pay becoming sufficient to cover the premiums, the employing office will deduct, in addition to the current pay period's premiums, an amount equal to the premiums for a pay period during which the employee was in a leave without pay (LWOP) status or pay was not enough to cover premiums. The employing office will continue using this method to deduct the accrued unpaid premiums from salary until the debt is recovered in full. The <PRTPAGE P="530"/>employee must also agree that if he or she does not return to work or the employing office cannot recover the debt in full from salary, the employing office may recover the debt from whatever other sources it normally has available for recovery of a debt to the Federal Government.</P>
              <P>(3) If the employee does not return the signed form within the time period described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the employing office will terminate the enrollment and notify the employee in writing of the termination.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) If the employee is prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from returning a signed form to the employing office within the time period described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, he or she may write to the employing office and request reinstatement of the enrollment. The employee must describe the circumstances that prevented him or her from returning the form. The request for reinstatement must be made within 30 calendar days from the date the employing office gives the employee notice of the termination. The employing office will determine if the employee is eligible for reinstatement of coverage. When the determination is affirmative, the employing office will reinstate the coverage of the employee retroactive to the date of termination. If the determination is negative, the employee may request a review of the decision from the employing agency (see § 890.104).</P>
              <P>(ii) If the employee is subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in § 890.301(g)(3), the coverage cannot terminate. If the employee does not return the signed form, the coverage will continue and the employee will incur a debt to the Federal Government as discussed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Terminations of enrollment under paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section are retroactive to the end of the last pay period in which the premium was withheld from pay. The employee and covered family members, if any, are entitled to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion and may convert to an individual contract for health benefits. An employee whose coverage is terminated may enroll upon his or her return to duty in pay status in a position in which the employee is eligible for coverage under this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures when agency under-withholds premiums.</E> (1) An agency that withholds less than the amount due for health benefits contributions from an individual's pay, annuity, or compensation must submit an amount equal to the uncollected employee contributions and any applicable agency contributions to OPM for deposit in the Employees Health Benefits Fund.</P>
              <P>(2) The agency must make the deposit to OPM as soon as possible, but no later than 60 calendar days after it determines the amount of an under-deduction that has occurred, regardless of whether or when the agency recovers the under-deduction. A subsequent agency decision on whether to waive collection of the overpayment of pay caused by failure to properly withhold employee health benefits contributions will be made under 5 U.S.C. 5584 as implemented by 4 CFR chapter I, subchapter G, unless the agency involved is excluded from 5 U.S.C. 5584, in which case any applicable authority to waive the collection may be used.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Direct premium payments for annuitants.</E> (1) If an annuity, excluding an annuity under subchapter III of chapter 84 (Thrift Savings Plan), is too low to cover the health benefits premium, or if a surviving spouse receives a basic employee death benefit, the retirement system must provide written information to the annuitant or surviving spouse. The information must describe the health benefits plans available, and include the opportunity to either:</P>
              <P>(i) Enroll in a health benefits plan in which the enrollee's share of the premium is less than the annuity amount; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Pay the premium directly to the retirement system.</P>
              <P>(2) The retirement system must accept direct payment for health benefits premiums in these circumstances. The annuitant or surviving spouse must continue direct payment of the premium even if the annuity increases to the extent that it covers the premium.</P>

              <P>(3) The annuitant or surviving spouse must pay the retirement system his or <PRTPAGE P="531"/>her share of the premium for the enrollment for every pay period during which the enrollment continues, except for the 31-day temporary extension of coverage. The individual must make the payment after each pay period in which he or she is covered using a schedule set up by the retirement system. If the retirement system does not receive payment by the due date, it must notify the individual in writing that continued coverage depends upon payment being made within 15 days (45 days for annuitants or surviving spouses residing overseas) after the notice is received. If no subsequent payments are made, the retirement system terminates the enrollment 60 days after the date of the notice (90 days for annuitants or surviving spouses residing overseas). An annuitant or surviving spouse whose enrollment terminated due to nonpayment of premium may not reenroll or reinstate coverage unless there are circumstances beyond his or her control as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) If the annuitant or surviving spouse is prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from paying the premium within 15 days after receiving the notice, he or she may ask the retirement system to reinstate the enrollment by writing the retirement system. The individual must describe the circumstances and send the request within 30 calendar days from the termination date. The retirement system will determine if the annuitant or surviving spouse is eligible for reinstatement of coverage. When the determination is affirmative, the retirement system will reinstate the coverage retroactive to the date of termination. If the determination is negative, then the individual may request a review of the decision from the retirement system, as described in § 890.104.</P>
              <P>(5) Termination of enrollment for failure to pay premiums within the time frame described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section is retroactive to the end of the last pay period for which payment was timely received.</P>
              <P>(6) The retirement system will submit all direct premium payments along with its regular health benefits premiums to OPM according to procedures established by OPM.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedures for direct payment of premiums during LWOP after 365 days.</E> (1) An employee who is granted leave without pay (LWOP) under subpart L of part 630 of this chapter (Family and Medical Leave) after 365 days of continued coverage under § 890.303(e) must pay the employee contributions directly to the employing office and keep payments current.</P>
              <P>(2) The employee must make payments after the pay period in which the employee is covered according to a schedule set up by the employing office. If the employing office does not receive the payment by the date due, it must notify the employee in writing that continued coverage depends upon payment being made within 15 days (45 days for employees residing overseas) after the notice is received. If no subsequent payments are made, the employing office terminates the enrollment 60 days after the date of the notice (90 days for enrollees residing overseas).</P>
              <P>(3) If the enrollee was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making payment within the timeframe in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, he or she may ask the employing office to reinstate the enrollment by writing to the employing office. The employee must file the request within 30 calendar days from the date of termination and must include supporting documentation.</P>
              <P>(4) The employing office determines whether the employee is eligible for reinstatement of coverage. When the determination is affirmative, the employing office will reinstate the coverage of the employee retroactive to the date of termination. If the determination is negative, the employee may request the employing agency to review the decision as provided under § 890.104.</P>
              <P>(5) An employee whose coverage is terminated under paragraph (e)(2) of this section may enroll if he or she returns to duty in a pay status in a position in which the employee is eligible for coverage under this part.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Uniformed services.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, an employee whose coverage continues under § 890.303(i) is responsible for payment of the employee share of <PRTPAGE P="532"/>the cost of enrollment for every pay period for which the enrollment continues for the first 365 days of continued coverage as set forth under paragraph (b) of this section. For coverage that continues after 365 days in nonpay status, the employee must pay, on a current basis, the full subscription charge, including both the employee and Government shares, plus an additional 2 percent of the full subscription charge.</P>
              <P>(2) As provided by 5 U.S.C. 8906(e)(3), an employing agency may pay both the Government and employee contributions and any additional administrative expenses for the cost of coverage for the employee and the employee's family for a period of 24 months for employees called or ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation on or after September 14, 2001. The payment of Government and employee contributions and any additional administrative expenses authorized by this section only applies to employees while they are serving in support of a contingency operation, and eligibility for these payments terminates when the employee ceases to be on orders for a contingency operation. Payment of these contributions and expenses is solely at the discretion of the employing agency.</P>

              <P>(b) The administrative reserve is credited with the one one-hundred-and-fourth of the enrollment charge set aside for the administrative reserve. The administrative reserve is available for payment of administrative expenses of OPM incurred under this part, and for such other purposes as may be authorized by law.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) <E T="03">Contingency reserve.</E> The contingency reserve for each plan is credited with—</P>
              <P>(i) The three one-hundred-and-fourths of the enrollment charge set aside for the contingency reserve from the enrollment charges for employees and annuitants enrolled for that plan;</P>
              <P>(ii) Amounts transferred in accordance with law from other contingency reserves and the administrative reserve;</P>
              <P>(iii) Income from investment of the reserve;</P>
              <P>(iv) Its proportionate share of the income from investment of the administrative reserve; and</P>
              <P>(v) Any return of reserves of the plan.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Contingency reserve minimum balance.</E> The preferred minimum balance for the contingency reserve for community-rated plans is 1 month's subscription charges at the average recurring monthly rate paid from the Employees Health Benefits Fund for the plan during the most recent contract period. The preferred minimum balance for the contingency reserve for experience-rated plans is 1<FR>1/2</FR> times an amount equal to the sum of an average month's paid claims plus an average month's administrative expenses and retentions, as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Amounts in excess of the preferred minimum balance for a contingency reserve account may be used with respect to the plan from which the reserve derives: To defray increases in future rates; to increase plan benefits, or to reduce contributions of eligible subscribers and the Government under the program through devices such as temporary suspension of, or reduction in, required contributions or a refund of contributions to eligible subscribers and the Government.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">OPM/carrier reserve transfers.</E> The target level for total reserves of an experience-rated plan is 3<FR>1/2</FR> times an amount equal to the sum of an average month's paid claims plus an average month's administrative expenses and retentions. Reserves include funds set aside for incurred-but-unpaid benefit claims and the “special” reserve representing the cumulative difference between income to the plan (subscription income plus interest on investments) and plan expenses (benefit costs plus <PRTPAGE P="533"/>administrative expenses and retentions). Included as carrier reserves is the balance in the letter of credit (LOC) account maintained by OPM for the plan. For the purposes of this section, an average month's paid claims is one-sixth of the total claims paid during the last 6 months of the most recent contract period, and an average month's administrative expenses and retentions is one-twelfth of the administrative expenses and retentions for the most recent contract period.</P>
              <P>(i) When, as of the end of a contract period, the total of all the reserves for an experience-rated plan is less than the target level described in the first four sentences of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the carrier is entitled to payment from the contingency reserve. Such contingency reserve payment shall equal the lesser of: An amount equal to the difference between the target level for the plan's reserves and the total of the reserves for the plan, or an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the contingency reserve over the preferred minimum balance. OMP must authorize this payment promptly after accepting the accounting statement for the contract period. The contingency reserve payment so authorized will be made available to the carrier's LOC account.</P>
              <P>(ii) When, as of the end of a contract period, the total of all reserves of an experience-rated plan amounts to more than the plan's target level, the excess over the plan's target level must be credited to the contingency reserve maintained by OPM for the plan. OPM will withdraw the excess amount from the plan's LOC account, based on reporting in the annual accounting statement for the year, no sooner than May 1, of the following year. If the accounting statement is not filed by the time limit specified in the plan's contract with OPM, OPM will estimate the amount of the excess reserves and may withdraw that amount from the plan's LOC account, or begin the process of offsetting that amount from subscription payments, no sooner than May 1. The amount withdrawn from the plan's LOC account, or offset from subscription payments, will be credited to that plan's contingency reserve.</P>
              <P>(4) OPM may, by agreement with the carrier, approve community rating for a comprehensive plan. If the contingency reserve of the carrier of a community-rated plan exceeds the preferred minimum balance, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the carrier may request OPM to pay to the plan a portion of the reserve not greater than the excess of the contingency reserve over the preferred minimum balance. The carrier shall state the reason for the request. OPM will decide whether to allow the request in whole or in part and will advise the plan of its decision.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Special contingency reserve transfers.</E> In addition to those amounts, if any, paid under paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section, OPM may authorize such other payments from the contingency reserve as in the judgment of OPM may be in the best interest of employees and annuitants enrolled in the program. A carrier for a plan may apply to OPM at any time for a payment from the contingency reserve when the carrier has good cause, such as unexpected claims experience and variations from expected community rates. In the administration of this part, OPM will accord a high priority to deciding whether to allow requests under this paragraph in whole or in part and will promptly advise the carrier of its decision. Amounts paid from the contingency reserve under paragraphs (c)(2) through (5) of this section shall be reported as subscription income in the year in which paid. By agreement with the carrier and where good cause exists, OPM may accept payment from carrier reserves for credit to the contingency reserve in an amount and under conditions other than those specified in paragraph (c) of this section. For carriers funded by LOC, the returned amount will be withdrawn from the plan's LOC account.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Subsidization penalty reserve.</E> This reserve account shall be credited with all subsidization penalties levied against community rated plans outlined in 48 CFR 1615.402(c)(3)(ii)(B). The funds in this account shall be annually distributed to the contingency reserves of all community rated plans subject to the FEHB-specific medical loss ratio threshold on a pro-rata basis. The <PRTPAGE P="534"/>funds will not be used for one specific carrier or plan.</P>

Except as otherwise provided, the former spouse must change the enrollment within the period beginning 31 days before the date of loss of coverage and ending 60 days after the date of loss of coverage, provided he or she continues to meet the eligibility requirements under § 890.803. Losses of coverage include but are not limited to—</P>

If the discontinuance is at a time other than the end of the contract year, OPM must establish a time and effective date for the former spouse to change the enrollment;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the whole plan is discontinued, a former spouse who does not change the enrollment within the time set will be enrolled in the lowest-cost nationwide plan option, as defined in § 890.301(n);</P>

              <P>(iv) If the discontinuance of the plan, whether permanent or temporary, is due to a disaster, the former spouse must change the enrollment within 60 days of the disaster, as announced by OPM. If a former spouse does not change the enrollment within the time frame announced by OPM, the former spouse will be enrolled in the lowest-cost nationwide plan option, as defined in § 890.301(n) of this section.

              <P>(v) A former spouse who is unable, for causes beyond his or her control, to make an enrollment change within the 60 days following a disaster and is, as a result, enrolled in the lowest-cost nationwide plan as defined in § 890.301(n), may request a belated enrollment into the plan of his or her choice subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

Similarly, a former spouse whose covered <PRTPAGE P="539"/>family member moves outside the geographic area from which the plan accepts enrollments, or if already outside this area, moves further from this area, may change the enrollment upon notifying the employing office of the family member's move.

              <P>(a)(1) Except for former spouses meeting the requirements in § 890.803(a)(3) (iv) and (v) of this part, a former spouse's enrollment terminates, subject to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion, at midnight of the last day of the pay period in which the earliest of the following events occurs:</P>
              <P>(i) Court order ceases to provide entitlement to survivor annuity or portion of retirement annuity under a retirement system for Government employees.</P>
              <P>(ii) Former spouse remarries before age 55.</P>

              <P>(vii) Refund of retirement money is paid to the separated employee on whose service the health benefits are based.</P>

              <P>(2) OPM may authorize a longer time frame for the temporary extension of coverage for conversion than the 31 days provided in § 890.401(a) if in OPM's judgment the former spouse could not have known that (1) the employee on whose service benefits are based left Federal service before establishing title to an immediate or deferred annuity; or (2) the separated employee on whose service the benefits are based died before the requirements for deferred annuity had been met. In such cases, the right of conversion may be exercised up to 31 days after the employing office's notice of termination. The former spouse must pay the full <PRTPAGE P="540"/>premium (employee's and Government's share) during the extended period, exclusive of the 31-day period following the notice.</P>
              <P>(3) Termination of enrollment for failure to pay premiums within the time frame established in accordance with § 890.808(d)(1) is retroactive to the end of the last pay period for which payment has been timely received.</P>

              <P>(b) The enrollment of a former spouse who meets the requirements in § 890.803(a)(3) (iv) or (v) of this part terminates, subject to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion, at midnight of the last day of the pay period in which the earliest of the following events occurs:</P>
              <P>(1) Former spouse remarries before age 55.</P>
              <P>(2) Former spouse dies.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Failure to make an election under § 890.806(m).</E> (1) If the annuity is insufficient to pay the full subscription charge due for the plan in which the former spouse is enrolled, the former spouse may elect one of the two opportunities offered under § 890.806(m) (electing a plan with a full subscription charge that is less than the annuity; or paying premiums directly to the retirement system in accordance with § 890.808(d)). Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section the enrollment of a former spouse who fails to make an election within the specified time frame will be terminated.</P>
              <P>(2) If the individual was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making an election within the time limit after receipt of the final notice, he or she may request reinstatement of coverage by writing to the retirement system. The retirement system will determine if the individual is eligible for reinstatement of coverage; and, when the determination is affirmative, the individual's coverage may be reinstated retroactively to the date of termination or prospectively. If the determination is negative, the individual may request reconsideration of the decision from OPM.</P>
              <P>(3) If the former spouse does not make an election under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and is enrolled in the high option of a plan that has two options, the former spouse is deemed to have elected enrollment in the standard option of the same plan unless the annuity is insufficient to pay the full withholdings for the standard option.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Coverage of members of the family.</E> The coverage of a member of the family of a former spouse terminates, subject to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion, at midnight of the earlier of the following dates:</P>
              <P>(1) The day on which the individual ceases to be an eligible family member.</P>
              <P>(2) The day the former spouse ceases to be enrolled, unless the family member is entitled as a survivor annuitant to continued enrollment or is entitled to continued coverage under the enrollment of another.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Cancellation.</E> (1) A former spouse may cancel his or her enrollment at any time by filing an appropriate request with the employing office. The cancellation takes effect on the last day of the pay period in which the appropriate request cancelling the enrollment is received by the employing office.</P>

              <P>(2) A former spouse may suspend enrollment in FEHB for the purpose of enrolling in a Medicare sponsored plan under sections 1833, 1876, or 1851 of the Social Security Act, or to enroll in the Medicaid program or a similar State-sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy, or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life coverage instead of FEHB coverage. To suspend FEHB coverage, documentation of eligibility for coverage under the non-FEHB Program must be submitted to the employing office or retirement system. If the documentation is received within the period beginning 31 days before and ending 31 days after the effective date of the enrollment in the Medicare sponsored plan, or the Medicaid or similar program, or within 31 days before or after the day designated by the former spouse as the day he or she wants to suspend FEHB coverage to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life coverage instead of FEHB coverage, then the <PRTPAGE P="541"/>suspension will be effective at the end of the day before the effective date of the enrollment or the end of the day before the day designated. Otherwise, the suspension is effective the first day of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing office or retirement system receives the documentation.</P>
              <P>(3) The former spouse and family members, if any, are not entitled to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion or to convert to an individual contract for health benefits.</P>
              <P>(4) A former spouse who cancels his or her enrollment for any reason may not later reenroll in the FEHB Program.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Employing office responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Application for benefits.</E> The former spouse's application for health benefits may be in the form of a Standard Form 2809, letter, or written statement to the employing office. Former spouses applying for benefits under § 890.803(a)(3)(iv) of this part must also include with their application a request for waiver of the application time limitation in accordance with § 890.805(b) of this part. Former spouses applying for benefits under § 890.803(a)(3)(v) of this part must also include with their application a request for waiver of the application time limitation in accordance with § 890.805(c) of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Administration of the enrollment process.</E> (1) The employing office will set up a method for accepting applications for enrollment informing the former spouse what documents to submit and where to submit them for an eligibility determination, and collecting premium payments. The method will include procedures for verifying the eligibility requirements under § 890.803(a) (1) and (2) of this part. The employing office must obtain OPM, Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System (FSRDS), or CIA Retirement and Disability System (CIARDS) documentation that the former spouse meets the additional requirement under § 890.803(a)(3) (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this part. A request for the retirement system's determination whether a court order is a qualifying court order for health benefits enrollment under this subpart must be accompanied by the documentation specified in § 838.221, § 838.721, or § 838.1005 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) The employing office will send the former spouse notice, in writing, of its decision. When an employing office informs a former spouse of his or her eligibility to enroll, it will identify the documents on which it based its decision and will include a premium payment schedule and statement of the requirements for continued enrollment under § 890.803. If the former spouse does not qualify for health benefits coverage, the employing office must give the former spouse a reconsideration right under § 890.104. Reconsideration requests from former spouses applying for benefits under § 890.803(a)(3)(iv) of this part must be directed to the Office of Personnel, Retirement Division, Central Intelligence Agency, Washington, DC 20505. Reconsideration requests from former spouses applying for benefits under § 890.803(a)(3)(v) of this part must be directed to the Department of State, Retirement Division, Washington, DC 20520.</P>
              <P>(3) The agency employing office will maintain a health benefits file for the former spouse as a file separate from the personnel records of the employee or former employee. The retirement system acting as employing office for the former spouse may file the former spouse health benefits records in with the annuitant's retirement records.</P>
              <P>(4) The former spouse will be required to certify that he or she meets the requirements listed in § 890.803 and that he or she will notify the employing office within 31 days of an event that results in failure to meet one or more of the requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Qualifying court order.</E> Subject to a 31-day extension period for conversion, the duration of health benefits coverage will coincide with any period specified in the qualifying court order <PRTPAGE P="542"/>providing for an annuity. A court order not meeting the requirements under part 838 of this chapter will not be used to establish or continue entitlement to a former spouse's health benefits coverage.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Premium payments.</E> (1) The former spouse must remit to the employing office the full subscription charge for the enrollment for every pay period during which the enrollment continues, exclusive of the 31-day temporary extension of coverage for conversion provided in §§ 890.401 and 890.807(a)(2). Payment must be made after the pay period in which the former spouse is covered in accordance with a schedule established by the employing office (see definition of <E T="03">pay period</E> under § 890.101(a)). If the employing office does not receive payment by the due date the employing office must notify the former spouse in writing that continuation of coverage depends upon payment being made within 15 days (45 days for enrollees residing overseas) after receipt of the notice. If no subsequent payments are made, the employing office terminates the enrollment 60 days (90 days for enrollees residing overseas) after the date of the notice. Termination for nonpayment of premium is considered a voluntary cancellation under § 890.807(d). A former spouse whose enrollment is terminated because of nonpayment of premium may not reenroll or reinstate coverage except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the individual was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making payment within 15 days after receipt of the notice, he or she may request reinstatement of coverage by writing to the employing office. Such a request must be filed within 30 calendar days from the date of termination and must be accompanied by verification that the individual was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from paying within the time limit. The employing office will determine if the individual is eligible for reinstatement of coverage; and, when the determination is affirmative, the individual's coverage may be reinstated retroactively to the date of termination. If the determination is negative, the individual may request a review of the decision from the employing agency as provided under § 890.104.</P>
              <P>(3) The employing office will submit all premium payments collected from former spouses along with its regular health benefits payments to OPM in accordance with procedures established by that Office.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Withholding from annuity.</E> The retirement system acting as employing office for a former spouse will establish a method for withholding the full subscription charge from the former spouse's annuity check. When the annuity is insufficient to cover the full subscription charge, the retirement system will follow the procedures specified in § 890.806(l).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Aggravating factors.</E> The presence of aggravating circumstances may support an OPM determination to increase the length of a debarment beyond the nominal periods set forth in §§ 890.1017 through 890.1021. The factors that OPM considers as aggravating are:</P>
                <P>(1) Whether the provider's actions underlying the basis for the debarment, or similar acts, had an adverse impact on the physical or mental health or well-being of one or more FEHBP-covered individuals or other persons.</P>
                <P>(2) Whether the provider has a documented history of prior criminal wrongdoing; civil violations related to health care items or services; improper conduct; or administrative violations addressed by a Federal or State agency. OPM may consider matters involving violence, patient abuse, drug abuse, or controlled substances convictions or violations to be particularly serious.</P>
                <P>(3) Whether the provider's actions underlying the basis for the debarment, or similar acts, resulted in financial loss to the FEHBP, FEHBP-covered individuals, or other persons. In determining whether, or to what extent, a financial loss occurred, OPM shall not consider any amounts of restitution that the provider may have paid.</P>

                <P>(4) Whether the provider's false, wrongful, or improper claims to FEHBP carriers were numerous, submitted over a prolonged period of time, <PRTPAGE P="550"/>or part of an on-going pattern of wrongful acts.</P>
                <P>(5) Whether the provider was specifically aware of or directly responsible for the acts constituting the basis for the debarment.</P>
                <P>(6) Whether the provider attempted to obstruct, hinder, or impede official inquiries into the wrongful conduct underlying the debarment.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Mitigating factors.</E> The presence of mitigating circumstances may support an OPM determination to shorten the length of a debarment below the nominal periods set forth in §§ 890.1017 through 890.1021, respectively. The factors that OPM considers as mitigating are:</P>
                <P>(1) Whether the provider's cooperation with Federal, State, or local authorities resulted in criminal convictions, civil recoveries, or administrative actions against other violators, or served as the basis for official determinations of program weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Restitution that the provider made for funds wrongfully, improperly, or illegally received from Federal or State programs may also be considered as a mitigating factor.</P>
                <P>(2) Whether official records of judicial proceedings or the proceedings of State licensing authorities contain a formal determination that the provider had a physical, mental, or emotional condition that reduced his level of culpability before or during the period in which he committed the violations in question.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Absence of factors.</E> The absence of aggravating or mitigating factors shall have no effect to either increase or lower the nominal period of debarment.</P>

The types of violations actionable under this provision are:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Entity's debarment.</E> If a provider's debarment is based on his ownership or control of a debarred entity, the debarment shall be concurrent with the entity's debarment. If any of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances identified in § 890.1016 applies directly to the provider that owns or controls the debarred entity and was not considered in setting the period of the entity's debarment, OPM may debar the provider for a period longer or shorter, respectively, than the entity's debarment.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Entity's conviction.</E> If a provider's debarment is based on the criminal conviction of an entity he owns or controls for an offense listed in 5 U.S.C. 8902a(b)(1)-(4), OPM shall debar the provider for a period of no less than 3 years, subject to adjustment for any aggravating or mitigating circumstances identified in § 890.1016 that apply to the provider as an individual.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for suspension.</E> OPM may suspend a provider if:</P>

                <P>(1) OPM obtains reliable evidence indicating that one of the grounds for suspension listed in paragraph (b) of this section applies to the provider; and<PRTPAGE P="554"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) The suspending official determines under paragraph (c) of this section that immediate action to suspend the provider is necessary to protect the health and safety of persons covered by FEHBP.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Grounds for suspension.</E> Evidence constituting grounds for a suspension may include, but is not limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) Indictment or conviction of a provider for a criminal offense that is a basis for mandatory debarment under this subpart;</P>
                <P>(2) Indictment or conviction of a provider for a criminal offense that reflects a risk to the health, safety, or well-being of FEHBP-covered individuals;</P>
                <P>(3) Other credible evidence indicating, in the judgment of the suspending official, that a provider has committed a violation that would warrant debarment under this subpart. This may include, but is not limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) Civil judgments;</P>
                <P>(ii) Notice that a Federal, State, or local government agency has debarred, suspended, or excluded a provider from participating in a program or revoked or declined to renew a professional license; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual or legal matters.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Determining need for immediate action.</E> Suspension is intended to protect the public interest, including the health and safety of covered individuals or the integrity of FEHBP funds. The suspending official has wide discretion to decide whether to suspend a provider. A specific finding of immediacy or necessity is not required to issue a suspension. The suspending official may draw reasonable inferences from the nature of the alleged misconduct and from a provider's actual or potential transactions with the FEHBP.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Previously adjudicated facts.</E> The suspension is based on an indictment or on facts determined by a prior adjudication in which the provider was afforded due process rights. Examples of due process proceedings include, but are not limited to, the adjudication procedures associated with licensure revocation, suspension, restriction, or nonrenewal by a State licensing authority; similar administrative adjudications by Federal, State, or local agencies; a criminal conviction or civil judgment; or an action by the provider that constitutes a waiver of his right to a due process adjudication, such as surrender of professional licensure during the pendency of a disciplinary hearing, entering a guilty plea or confession of judgment in a judicial proceeding, or signing a settlement agreement stipulating facts that constitute a sanctionable violation. Neither the existence of the prior adjudication nor any of the underlying circumstances are considered to be subject to genuine factual dispute as part of the suspension proceeding.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Advisory by law enforcement officials.</E> OPM is advised by the Department of Justice, the appropriate U.S. Attorney's Office, a State attorney general's office, or a State or local prosecutor's office that proceedings before a presiding official would prejudice the substantial interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">No bona fide dispute of material facts.</E> The information, arguments, and documents submitted to the suspending official do not establish that there is a <E T="03">bona fide</E> factual dispute regarding facts material to the suspension.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Application required.</E> A provider may apply for a limited waiver of debarment at any time after receiving OPM's notice of proposed debarment. Suspended providers are not eligible to request a waiver of suspension.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria for granting waiver.</E> To receive a waiver, a provider shall clearly demonstrate that:</P>
                <P>(1) The provider is the <E T="03">sole community provider</E> or the <E T="03">sole source of essential specialized services in a community;</E>
                </P>
                <P>(2) A limited waiver of debarment would be in the best interests of covered individuals in the defined service area;</P>
                <P>(3) There are reasonable assurances that the actions which formed the basis for the debarment shall not recur; and</P>
                <P>(4) There is no basis under this subpart for continuing the debarment.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Waiver applies only in the defined service area.</E> A limited waiver applies only to items or services provided within the defined service area where a provider is the <E T="03">sole community provider</E> or <E T="03">sole source of essential specialized services.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Governmentwide effect continues.</E> A limited waiver applies only to a provider's FEHBP transactions. Even if OPM waives a debarment for FEHBP purposes, the governmentwide effect under section 2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-355) continues for all other Federal agencies' procurement and nonprocurement programs and activities.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Waiver rescinded if circumstances change.</E> OPM shall rescind the limited waiver when any of its underlying bases no longer apply. If OPM rescinds the limited waiver, the provider's debarment shall resume full effect for all FEHBP transactions. Events warranting rescission include, but are not limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) The provider ceases to furnish items or services in the defined service area;</P>
                <P>(2) Another provider begins to furnish equivalent items or services in the defined service area, so that the provider who received a waiver is no longer the sole provider or sole source; or</P>
                <P>(3) The actions that formed the basis for the provider's debarment, or similar acts, recur.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Effect on period of debarment.</E> The minimum period of debarment is established when the debarment is initially imposed. A subsequent decision to grant, deny, or rescind a limited waiver shall not change that period.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Application is necessary for reinstatement.</E> A provider who has received a limited waiver shall apply for reinstatement at the end of the debarment period, even if a limited waiver is in effect when the debarment expires.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Finality of debarring official's decision.</E> The debarring official's decision to grant or deny a limited waiver is final and not subject to further administrative review or reconsideration.</P>

This provision is intended solely to protect the interests of FEHBP-<PRTPAGE P="559"/>covered persons who obtain services from a debarred or suspended provider in good faith and without knowledge that the provider has been sanctioned. It does not authorize debarred or suspended providers to submit claims for payment to FEHBP carriers.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice sent by carrier.</E> When paying a claim under the authority of paragraph (a) of this section, an FEHBP carrier must send a written notice to the covered individual, stating:</P>
                <P>(1) That the provider is debarred or suspended and is prohibited from receiving payment of FEHBP funds for items or services furnished after the effective date of the debarment or suspension;</P>
                <P>(2) That claims may not be paid for items or services furnished by the debarred or suspended provider after the covered individual is informed of the debarment or suspension;</P>
                <P>(3) That the current claim is being paid as a legally-authorized exception to the effect of the debarment or suspension in order to protect covered individuals who obtain items or services without knowledge of their provider's debarment or suspension;</P>
                <P>(4) That FEHBP carriers are required to deny payment of any claim for items or services rendered by a debarred or suspended provider 15 days or longer after the date of the notice described in paragraph (b) of this section, unless the covered individual had no knowledge of the provider's debarment or suspension when the items or services were rendered;</P>

Requests shall not be accepted for continued payments to suspended providers.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">OPM action on the request.</E> OPM shall consider the recommendation of the FEHBP carrier before acting on the request. To be approved, the request shall demonstrate that:</P>
                <P>(1) Interrupting an existing, ongoing course of treatment by the provider would have a detrimental effect on the covered individual's health or safety; or</P>
                <P>(2) The covered individual does not have access to an alternative source of the same or equivalent health care items or services within a reasonably accessible service area.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Civil monetary penalty.</E> A civil monetary penalty is an amount that OPM may impose on a health care provider who commits one of the violations listed in § 890.1061. Penalties are intended to protect the integrity of FEHBP by deterring repeat violations by the same provider and by reducing the likelihood of future violations by other providers.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Assessment.</E> An assessment is an amount that OPM may impose on a provider, calculated by reference to the claims involved in the underlying violations. Assessments are intended to recognize monetary losses, costs, and damages sustained by OPM as the result of a provider's violations.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> In §§ 890.1060 through 890.1072:</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Penalty</E> means civil monetary penalty; and</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Penalties and assessments</E> may connote the singular or plural forms of either of those terms, and may represent either the conjunctive or disjunctive sense.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Relationship to debarment and suspension.</E> In addition to imposing penalties and assessments, OPM may concurrently debar or suspend a provider from participating in the FEHBP on the basis of the same violations.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Relationship to other penalties provided by law.</E> The penalties, assessments, debarment, and suspension imposed by OPM are in addition to any other penalties that may be prescribed by law or regulation administered by an agency of the Federal Government or any State.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">False or misleading statements.</E> OPM may impose penalties and assessments on a provider who makes a false statement or misrepresentation as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 8902a(d)(2).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Failing to provide claims-related information.</E> OPM may impose penalties and assessments on a provider who knowingly fails to provide claims-related information as otherwise required by law.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Factors to be considered.</E> In deciding whether to impose penalties and assessments against a provider that has committed one of the violations identified in § 890.1061, OPM must consider:</P>

                <SUBJECT>Determining the amounts of penalties and assessments to be imposed on a provider.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority of debarring official.</E> The debarring official has discretionary authority to set the amounts of penalties and assessments in accordance with law and this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Factors considered in determining amounts of penalties and assessments.</E> In determining the amounts of penalties and assessments to impose on a provider, the debarring official must consider:</P>
                <P>(1) The Government's interests in being fully compensated for all damages, losses, and costs associated with the provider's violations, including:</P>
                <P>(i) Amounts wrongfully paid from FEHBP funds as the result of the provider's violations and interest on those amounts, at rates determined by the Department of the Treasury;</P>
                <P>(ii) All costs incurred by OPM in investigating a provider's sanctionable misconduct; and</P>
                <P>(iii) All costs incurred in OPM's administrative review of the case, including every phase of the administrative sanctions processes described by this subpart;</P>
                <P>(2) The Government's interests in deterring future misconduct by health care providers;</P>
                <P>(3) The provider's personal financial situation, or, in the case of an entity, the entity's financial situation;</P>
                <P>(4) All of the factors set forth in § 890.1062(b) and (c); and</P>
                <P>(5) The presence of aggravating or less serious circumstances, as described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Aggravated and less serious circumstances.</E> The presence of aggravating circumstances may cause OPM to impose penalties and assessments at a higher level within the authorized range, while less serious violations may warrant sanctions of relatively lower amounts. Paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) of this section provide examples of aggravated and less serious violations. These examples are illustrative only, and are not intended to represent an exhaustive list of all possible types of violations.</P>
                <P>(1) The existence of many separate violations, or of violations committed over an extended period of time, constitutes an aggravating circumstance. OPM may consider conduct involving a small number of violations, committed either infrequently or within a brief period of time, to be less serious.</P>
                <P>(2) Violations for which a provider had direct knowledge of the material facts (for example, submitting claims that the provider knew to contain false, inaccurate, or misleading information), or for which the provider did not cooperate with OPM's or an FEHBP carrier's investigations, constitute aggravating circumstances. OPM may consider violations where the provider did not have direct knowledge of the material facts, or in which the provider cooperated with post-violation investigative efforts, to be less serious.</P>
                <P>(3) Violations resulting in substantial damages, losses, and costs to OPM, the FEHBP, or FEHBP-covered persons constitute aggravating circumstances. Violations producing a small or negligible overall financial impact may be considered to be less serious.</P>
                <P>(4) A pattern of conduct reflecting numerous improper claims, high-dollar false claims, or improper claims involving several types of items or services constitutes aggravating circumstances. OPM may consider a small number of improper claims for relatively low dollar amounts to be less serious.</P>
                <P>(5) Every violation involving any harm, or the risk of harm, to the health and safety of an FEHBP enrollee, must be considered an aggravating circumstance.</P>
                <P>(6) Any prior violation described in § 890.1062(b)(5) constitutes an aggravating circumstance. OPM may consider repeated or multiple prior violations to represent an especially serious form of aggravating circumstances.</P>
                <P>(7) OPM may consider other circumstances or actions to be aggravating or less serious within the context of an individual case, as the interests of justice require.</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Proposing debarment in the same notice.</E> OPM may propose a provider's debarment in the same notice that also proposes penalties and assessments.

If the provider pursues a combined contest, the requirements set forth in §§ 890.1022 through 890.1024, as well as this section, apply.</P>

The provisions of § 890.1027(b) and (c), 890.1028, and 890.1029(a) and (b) will govern such a hearing.</P>

              <P>(a) Individuals covered under this subpart or eligible survivors enrolled under this subpart may increase enrollment type if they acquire an eligible family member. The change may be made at the written request of the enrollee at any time after the family member is acquired. An increase in enrollment type under this paragraph (a) becomes effective on the 1st day of the pay period after the pay period during which the request is received by the U.S. Department of State, except that a change based on the birth or addition of a child as a new family member is effective on the 1st day of the pay period during which the child is born or otherwise becomes a new family member.</P>
              <P>(b) Individuals covered under this subpart or eligible survivors enrolled under this subpart may decrease enrollment type from a self and family enrollment when the last eligible family member (other than the enrollee) ceases to be a family member or only one family member remains; and may decrease enrollment type from a self plus one enrollment when no family member remains. The change may be made at the written request of the enrollee at any time after the last family member is lost and it becomes effective on the 1st day of the pay period after the pay period during which the request is received by the U.S. Department of State.</P>
              <P>(c) A family member may file a request to change the type of enrollment on behalf of a hostage during the period of hostage status or on behalf of an eligible former hostage who cannot file the election on his or her own behalf because of a mental or physical disability.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The purpose of this subpart is to implement section 721 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 1999, Public Law 105-261. This section amended chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, and chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, to establish a demonstration project under which certain Medicare and other eligible Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries can enroll in health benefit plans offered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program in certain geographic areas. The legislation was signed into law on October 17, 1998. The demonstration project will run for a period of three years. The legislation requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and DoD to jointly produce and submit two reports to Congress designed to assess the viability of expanding access to the FEHB Program to certain Medicare and other eligible DoD beneficiaries permanently. OPM is authorizing certain differences from regular FEHB Program practices in order to ensure the successful implementation of the demonstration project. This regulation authorizes those differences.</P>

              <P>(a) To enroll in the demonstration project, an individual must live within one of the demonstration areas and meet the definition of an eligible beneficiary in 10 U.S.C. 1108(b). An eligible beneficiary under this subpart is—</P>

              <P>(1) A member or former member of the uniformed services described in section 1074(b) of title 10, United States Code, who is entitled to hospital insurance benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395c <E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
              <P>(2) An individual who is an unremarried former spouse of a member or former member described in section 1072(2)(F) or section 1072(2)(G) of title 10, United States Code;</P>
              <P>(3) An individual who is—</P>
              <P>(i) A dependent of a deceased member or former member described in section 1076(b) or 1076(a)(2)(B) of title 10, United States Code, or of a member who died while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A “member of family” as defined in section 8901(5) of title 5, United States Code; or</P>
              <P>(4) An individual who is—</P>
              <P>(i) A dependent of a living member or former member described in section 1076(b)(1) of title 10, United States Code, who is entitled to hospital insurance benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, regardless of the member's or former member's eligibility for such hospital insurance benefits; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A “member of family” as defined in section 8901(5) of title 5, United States Code.</P>
              <P>(b) An eligible beneficiary may enroll in an FEHB plan under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, for self-only coverage or for self and family coverage. A self and family enrollment will include coverage of a dependent of the military member or former member who meets the definition of a “member of family” in section 8901(5) of title 5, United States Code. A self and family enrollment will not cover a person related to the eligible beneficiary that does not qualify as a “member of family” (as defined in section 8901(5) of title 5, United States Code) of the military member or former member.</P>
              <P>(c) A person eligible for coverage under this subpart shall not be required to satisfy any eligibility criteria specified in chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, or in other subparts of this part (except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (b) of this section) as a condition for enrollment in health benefit plans offered through the FEHB Program under the demonstration project.</P>

              <P>(d) When determining whether an individual is a “member of family” under section 8901(5) of title 5, United States Code, for purposes of paragraph (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, a DoD member or former member described in section 1076(b) or 1076(a)(2)(B) of title 10, United States Code, shall be deemed to be an employee under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code. The sole purpose for deeming these members or <PRTPAGE P="576"/>former members of the uniformed services employees under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, is to determine which of their dependents can enroll as eligible beneficiaries in the demonstration project.</P>
              <P>(e) A person who is eligible to enroll in the FEHB Program as an employee as defined in section 8901(1) of title 5, United States Code, is not eligible to enroll in an FEHB plan under the demonstration project.</P>

              <P>(a) Open Season for eligible beneficiaries will be held concurrent with the Open Season for regular FEHB enrollees. Open Seasons will be held in the years 1999, 2000 and 2001. Eligible beneficiaries will be able to enroll for coverage, change enrollment tiers (e.g., self-only or self and family), or change health benefit plans or plan options during these periods.</P>
              <P>(b) Enrolled eligible beneficiaries are required to pay associate membership dues if they enroll in open employee organization sponsored plans that are participating in the demonstration project.</P>
              <P>(c) DoD will deny enrollment of eligible beneficiaries when the total number of eligible beneficiaries and family members enrolled in the demonstration project reaches 66,000.</P>
              <P>(d) Eligible beneficiaries can enroll only in health plans offered by health benefit carriers who are participating in the demonstration project.</P>
              <P>(e) Eligible beneficiaries and family members enrolled in the demonstration project are not eligible to obtain services from military medical treatment facilities or to enroll in a health care plan under the TRICARE Program.</P>
              <P>(f) An eligible beneficiary enrolled in an FEHB plan under the demonstration project may change health benefits plans and coverage in the same manner as any other FEHB Program enrollee, except as provided for in this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Termination and cancellation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If an enrolled eligible beneficiary moves out of a demonstration area, the enrollment of the eligible beneficiary and all family members will be terminated. If an enrolled eligible beneficiary moves to an area located within a demonstration area, he or she will continue to be eligible to participate in the demonstration project. If the eligible beneficiary was enrolled prior to the move in an HMO that does not serve the new demonstration area, the eligible beneficiary will have an opportunity to select a new health plan offered by a carrier participating in the demonstration project in the new area. If the eligible beneficiary was enrolled in a fee-for-service plan prior to the move and moves to another area that is within an existing demonstration area, the eligible beneficiary can maintain his or her current coverage.</P>
              <P>(b) If an enrolled eligible beneficiary disenrolls, cancels, or terminates enrollment for any reason, he or she will not be eligible to reenroll in the demonstration project. Once coverage ends, eligible beneficiaries and all family members have the right to resume all of the benefits to which they are entitled to under title 10 of the United States Code. Medicare-covered eligible beneficiaries and their eligible family members who had Medigap policies prior to their enrollment in the demonstration project are entitled to reinstate that coverage under the conditions stated in section 1108(l) of title 10, United States Code.</P>

              <P>(c) Eligible beneficiaries and their family members are eligible for Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) under the conditions and for the durations described in subpart K or until the end of the demonstration project, whichever occurs first. The effective date of TCC for eligible beneficiaries or their eligible family members will be the day after other coverage under this subpart ends. Eligible beneficiaries or their eligible family members selecting TCC must enroll in a health plan offered by a carrier participating in the demonstration project. If an eligible beneficiary or eligible family member enrolled in DoD TCC moves from a demonstration project area, coverage ends. DoD TCC enrollees will be responsible for paying the entire DoD premium rate (OPM's approved net-to-carrier DoD rate plus 4 percent for contingency and administration reserves) plus 2 percent of this premium rate for administration of the program. DoD <PRTPAGE P="577"/>will make arrangements to collect premiums plus the 2 percent administrative charge from eligible beneficiaries and forward them to OPM's Employees Health Benefits Fund. OPM will establish procedures for receiving the 2 percent administrative payment into the Employees Health Benefits Fund and making this amount available to DoD for administration of the program.</P>
              <P>(d) Enrolled eligible beneficiaries are not eligible for the temporary extension of coverage and conversion opportunities described in subpart D of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) In this subpart—</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Billing unit</E> is a subdivision of the tribal employer's workforce that aligns tribal employees for purposes of administering FEHB enrollment and collection of payment. A billing unit may be either governmental or commercial or a combination of both. So long as a tribal employer purchases FEHB for at least one billing unit that is carrying out at least one program under ISDEAA or IHCIA, the tribal employer may purchase FEHB for other billing units without regard to its programs.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Pay period i</E>s the interval of time for which a paycheck is issued by the tribal employer for work performed by the tribal employee.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Paymaster</E> is the entity designated by OPM as responsible for receiving FEHB premiums from the tribal employer, forwarding premiums to the Employees Health Benefits Fund, and maintaining <PRTPAGE P="578"/>enrollment records for all participating tribal employers.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Payment</E> is the sum of the tribal employer's share of premium plus the tribal employees' share of premium plus any administrative fees or costs required under this subpart, due for the enrollment, in the aggregate, of the tribal employer's tribal employees.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Tribal employee</E> is a full-time or part-time common law employee of a tribal employer. An individual is a common law employee if, based on all the facts and circumstances, the tribal employer has the right to control and direct the individual who performs the services, not only as to the result to be accomplished by the work but also as to the details and means by which that result is accomplished. This determination is based on all facts and circumstances and shall be guided by the factors described by the Internal Revenue Service in Rev. Rul. 87-41, 1987-1 C.B. 296 and referenced in Joint Committee on Taxation report JCX-26-07 <E T="03">Present Law and Background Relating to Worker Classification for Federal Tax Purposes,</E> dated May 7, 2007, and the determination shall be consistent with the tribal employer's determination of common law employee status for Federal employment tax purposes, if any. For purposes of this subpart, tribal employees do not include retirees or annuitants of a tribal employer, volunteers of a tribal employer, or others who are not common law employees of a tribal employer. Categories of excluded tribal employees are described at § 890.1405(b). FEHB benefits available to tribal employees are set forth in this subpart and to the extent there exists any ambiguity or inconsistency between this subpart and other subparts of part 890, the terms of this subpart will govern FEHB benefits available to tribal employees.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Tribal employer</E> is an Indian tribe or tribal organization (as those terms are defined in 25 U.S.C. Chapter 18, “Indian Health Care”) carrying out at least one program under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act or an urban Indian organization (as that term is defined in 25 U.S.C. Chapter 18, “Indian Health Care”) carrying out at least one program under the title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, provided that the tribe, tribal organization, or urban Indian organization certifies entitlement to purchase FEHB according to the process described in Subpart N. FEHB benefits that tribal employers are entitled to purchase for their tribal employees are set forth in this subpart and to the extent there exists any ambiguity or inconsistency between this subpart and other subparts of part 890, the terms of this subpart will govern FEHB benefits available for purchase by tribal employers.</P>
              <P>(b) In this subpart, wherever reference is made to other subparts of part 890—</P>
              <P>(1) A reference to employee is deemed a reference to tribal employee;</P>

              <P>(5) A reference to United States, Federal Government, or Government in the capacity of an employer is deemed a reference to tribal employer;</P>
              <P>(6) A reference to Federal Service or Government Service is deemed a reference to employment with a tribal employer;</P>
              <P>(7) A reference to annuitant, survivor annuitant, or an individual with entitlement to an annuity is deemed inapplicable in the context of this subpart; and</P>
              <P>(8) A reference incorporated into this subpart that does not otherwise apply to tribal employees and tribal employers shall have no meaning and is deemed inapplicable in the context of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(7) Agreement that the tribal employer will establish or identify an independent dispute resolution panel to adjudicate appeals of determinations made by a tribal employer regarding an individual's status as a tribal employee eligible to enroll in FEHB, eligibility of family members, and eligibility to change enrollment.

              <P>(10) Other terms and conditions as appropriate.</P>

              <P>(c) A tribal employer may make an initial election to purchase FEHB at any time.

              <P>(a) A tribal employee who is a full-time or part-time common law employee of a tribal employer is eligible to enroll in FEHB if that tribal employer has elected to purchase FEHB coverage for the tribal employees of that tribal employer's billing unit, except that a tribal employee described in paragraph (b) of this section is not eligible to enroll in FEHB.</P>
              <P>(b) Status as a tribal employee under § 890.1402(a) for purposes of eligibility to enroll in FEHB is initially made based on a reasonable determination by the tribal employer. OPM maintains final authority to correct errors regarding FEHB enrollment as set forth at § 890.1406.</P>

              <P>(5) A tribal employee paid on a piecework basis, except one whose work schedule provides for full-time service or part-time service with a regular tour of duty.</P>
              <P>(e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section a tribal employee working on a temporary appointment, a tribal employee working on a seasonal schedule of less than 6 months in a year, or a tribal employee working on an intermittent schedule, for whom the tribal employer expects the total hours in pay status (including overtime hours) plus qualifying leave without pay hours to be at least 130 hours per calendar month, is eligible to enroll in FEHB according to terms described in § 890.102(j) unless the tribal employer provides written notification to the Director as described in § 890.102(k).</P>
              <P>(f) The tribal employer initially determines eligibility of a tribal employee to enroll in FEHB, eligibility of family members, and eligibility of tribal employee to change enrollment. The tribal employer's initial decision may be appealed pursuant to § 890.1415.</P>

Former spouses of tribal employees are not former spouses as described at 5 U.S.C. 8901(10) and are not eligible to elect coverage under subpart H.</P>
              <P>(i) Eligibility for FEHB under this subpart does not identify an individual as a Federal employee for any purpose, nor does it convey any additional rights or privileges of Federal employment.</P>

A tribal employee who does not participate in premium conversion <PRTPAGE P="582"/>may cancel his or her enrollment or decrease his or her enrollment at any time by request to the tribal employer, unless there is a legally binding court or administrative order requiring coverage of a child as described at § 890.301(g)(3). A tribal employee who participates in premium conversion may cancel his or her enrollment as provided by § 892.209 or decrease his or her enrollment as provided by § 892.208 of this chapter only during open season or because of and consistent with a qualifying life event.</P>
              <P>(b) A cancellation of enrollment becomes effective as described at § 890.304(d). A decrease in enrollment becomes effective as described in § 890.301(e)(2).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Election.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The original period for election by each eligible retired employee was during the months of March and April 1961. Failure to elect when eligible to do so is deemed an election not to participate in the program unless the failure is determined by the retirement office to be for cause beyond the control of the retired employee. In any case in which annuity or compensation is being paid to a payee in behalf of a retired employee, the payee shall make the election for the retired employee.</P>
              <P>(b) (1) A retired employee may elect to participate in the program for self alone or for self and family.</P>
              <P>(2) Survivors, if actually or constructively living in the same household, have only one right of election among them. The election shall be made by the payee. The fact that one payee is receiving annuity or compensation for all members of the family is prima facie evidence that they are living in the same household. The existence of more than one payee is prima facie evidence that each payee and the survivors in whose behalf the payee is receiving annuity or compensation constitute a separate household, and each payee may elect for the survivors in whose behalf he is receiving annuity or compensation, but where a family is receiving annuity or compensation through more than one payee, one payee, with the consent of the other payees, may elect for the whole family.</P>
              <P>(3) A retired employee may not be covered under more than one election.</P>
              <P>(4) A retired employee who is entitled to more than one annuity or to compensation and annuity is entitled to only one election.</P>
              <P>(c) Each retired employee who elects to receive a Government contribution toward the cost of a private health benefits plan shall file with his election a certificate of the carrier, on the form prescribed by OPM for the purpose, that he is a subscriber to a health benefits plan. OPM, or the appropriate retirement office, at any time may require that a retired employee renew the certificate, or may take such other action as it considers desirable to verify the continuing eligibility of the retired employee to receive a Government contribution. The appropriate retirement office may suspend the Government contribution when there is a reasonable doubt of the retired employee's continuing eligibility to receive the Government contribution.</P>
              <P>(d) In the discretion of the retirement office, a representative of the retired employee having a written authorization to do so may elect for him.</P>

              <P>(e) A person who was not eligible, during the months of March and April 1961, to elect to subscribe to the uniform plan or to receive a Government contribution toward the cost of a private health benefits plan, may apply to the appropriate retirement office when he becomes eligible. If the retirement <PRTPAGE P="591"/>office determines that he is eligible, it shall notify the retired employee that he is eligible to make an election in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) of this section within 60 days of the date of the notice. If the retirement office determines that a retired employee was unable, for cause beyond his control, to make an election within the time limits prescribed by this section, it shall notify the retired employee that he is eligible to make an election in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) of this section within 60 days of the date of the notice. Elections made under this paragraph are effective, for a retired employee receiving annuity and a survivor receiving compensation, on the first day of the third month following the month in which the retirement office receives the election. Withholdings and contributions are effective for months beginning on and after the first day of the second month following the month in which the retirement office receives the election. For any other retired employee receiving compensation, changes of election made under this paragraph are effective on the first day of the third 4-week period following the 4-week period in which the Bureau of Employees' Compensation receives the election, and withholdings and contributions are effective beginning with the second 4-week period following receipt of the election. This paragraph does not apply to retired employees who have been, at any time, covered by the election of another under this part.</P>
              <P>(f) Retired employees and survivors who, on January 1, 1973, were enrolled for either basic coverage only or major medical coverage only of the Uniform Plan are, effective January 1, 1973, automatically enrolled in basic plus major medical coverage of the Uniform Plan.</P>

              <P>Premium conversion is a method of reducing your taxable income by the amount of your contribution to your FEHB insurance premium. If you are a participant in the premium conversion plan, Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code allows you to reduce your salary (through an employer allotment) and provide that portion of your salary back to your employer. Instead of being paid to you as taxable income, this allotted amount is used to purchase your FEHB insurance for you. The effect is that your taxable income is reduced. Because taxable income is reduced, the amount of tax you pay is reduced. You save on Federal income tax, Social Security and Medicare tax and in most States and localities, State and local income taxes.</P>

              <P>(c) If you are subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in § 890.301(g)(3) of this chapter, your employing agency can limit a change to your enrollment as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect and you have at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless you provide documentation to your agency that you have other coverage for your child or children. <E T="03">See also</E> § 892.208 and § 892.209.</P>

              <P>(d) During the first plan year in which the self plus one enrollment type is available, OPM will administer a limited enrollment period for enrollees who participate in premium conversion. During this limited enrollment period, enrollees who participate in premium conversion will be allowed to decrease enrollment from self and family to self plus one during a time period determined by OPM. No other changes, including changes in plan or plan option or increases in enrollment, will be allowed. Enrollments will be effective on the first day of the first pay period <PRTPAGE P="599"/>following the one in which the appropriate request is received by the employing office.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Can I decrease my enrollment type at any time?</SUBJECT>
              <P>If you are participating in premium conversion you may decrease your FEHB enrollment type under either of the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">During the annual open season.</E> A decrease in enrollment type made during the annual open season takes effect on the 1st day of the first pay period that begins in the next year.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Within 60 days after you have a qualifying life event.</E> A decrease in enrollment type made because of a qualifying life event takes effect on the first day of the first pay period that begins after the date your employing office receives your appropriate request. Your change in enrollment must be consistent with and correspond to your qualifying life event. For example, if you get divorced and have no dependent children, changing to self only would be consistent with that qualifying life event. As another example, if both you and your spouse are Federal employees, and your youngest dependent turns age 26, changing from a self and family to a self plus one or two self only enrollments would be consistent and appropriate for that event.</P>
              <P>(c) If you are subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in § 890.301(g)(3), you may not decrease enrollment type in a way that eliminates coverage of a child identified in the order as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect and you have at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless you provide documentation to your agency that you have other coverage for your child or children. See also §§ 892.207 and 892.209. If you are subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in § 890.301(g)(3), you may not change your enrollment to self plus one as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect and you have more than one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless you provide documentation to your agency that you have other coverage for your children. See also §§ 892.207 and 892.209.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Can I cancel FEHB coverage at any time?</SUBJECT>
              <P>If you are participating in premium conversion you may cancel your FEHB coverage:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">During the annual open season.</E> A cancellation made during the annual open season is effective at midnight of the day before the first day of the first pay period that begins in the next year.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Within 60 days after you have a qualifying life event.</E> A cancellation made because of a qualifying life event takes effect at midnight of the last day of the pay period in which your employing office receives your appropriate request to cancel your enrollment. Your cancellation of coverage must be consistent with and correspond to your qualifying life event. For example, if you get married and you gain other insurance coverage because your spouse's employer provides health insurance for your spouse and you, then canceling FEHB coverage would be consistent with that qualifying life event. If you add an eligible family member, canceling coverage would generally not be consistent with that qualifying life event.</P>
              <P>(c) If you are subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in § 890.301(g)(3) of this chapter, you may not cancel your coverage as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect and you have at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless you provide documentation to your agency that you have other coverage for your child or children.</P>

              <P>(a) Your commencement of a period of LWOP is a qualifying life event as described in § 892.101. You may change your premium conversion election (waive if you now participate, or participate if you now waive).</P>
              <P>(b)(1) You may continue your FEHB coverage by agreeing in advance of LWOP to one of the payment options described in paragraph (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Pre-pay.</E> Prior to commencement of your LWOP you may allot through payroll deduction the amount that will be due for your share of your FEHB premium during your LWOP period, if your employing agency, at its discretion, allows you to do so. Contributions under the pre-pay option may be made through premium conversion on a pre-tax basis. Alternatively, you may pre-pay premiums for the LWOP period on an after-tax basis.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Direct pay.</E> Under the direct pay option, you may pay your share of your FEHB premium on the same schedule of payments that would be made if you were not on LWOP, as described in § 890.502(b) of this chapter. You must make the premium payments directly to your employing agency. The payments you make under the direct pay option are not subject to premium conversion, and are made on an after-tax basis.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Catch-up.</E> Under the catch-up option, you must agree in advance of the LWOP period that: you will continue FEHB coverage while on LWOP; your employer will advance your share of your FEHB premium during your LWOP period; and you will repay the advanced amounts when you return from LWOP. (Described in § 890.502(b) of this chapter.) Your catch-up contributions may be made through premium conversion.</P>
              <P>(5) If you remain in FEHB upon your return from LWOP, your catch-up premiums and current premiums will be paid at the same time.</P>
              <P>(c) Your return from LWOP constitutes a qualifying life event as described in § 892.101. You may change your premium conversion election (waive if you now participate, or participate if you now waive). The election you choose upon return from LWOP will apply to your current as well as your catch-up premiums.</P>

              <P>As a participant in premium conversion, instead of having your premium withheld from after-tax salary, your salary will be reduced (through a Federal allotment) by the amount equal to your FEHB premium, which you will allot to your agency. The allotment from salary satisfies the FEHB premium payment requirement of 5 U.S.C. 8906. Your employer is authorized to accept this allotment under § 550.311(a)(7) and § 550.312 of this chapter or, for employers not subject to those regulations, a similar mechanism. Your agency will use the allotment to pay your share of your FEHB premium. This will reduce your taxable income as described in § 892.102.</P>

              <P>(a) If you are a retired individual enrolled in FEHB who is receiving an annuity and you are reemployed in a position that conveys FEHB eligibility and is covered by the premium conversion plan, you are automatically covered by premium conversion, unless you waive participation as described in § 892.205.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) If you do not waive premium conversion, your FEHB coverage will be transferred to your employing agency, and your employing agency will assume responsibility for contributing the Government share of your FEHB coverage. Your coverage, including what FEHB plans you are eligible to enroll in, will be based on your status as an active employee and your employing agency will deduct your premiums from your salary.</P>
              <P>(2) If you elect to waive participation in premium conversion, you will keep your FEHB coverage as an annuitant, but your contributions towards your FEHB premiums will be made on an after-tax basis. Your employing agency must receive your waiver no later than 60 days after the date you return to Federal employment. A waiver will be effective at the beginning of the first pay period after your employer receives it.</P>
              <P>(c) If you did not carry FEHB into retirement and you are reemployed as an employee in a position covered by the premium conversion plan, you may enroll in the FEHB Program as a new employee as described in § 890.301 of this chapter. Upon enrolling in FEHB, you are automatically covered by the premium conversion plan, unless you waive participation as described in § 892.205.</P>
              <P>(d) Your status as an annuitant under the retirement regulations and your right to continue FEHB as an annuitant following your period of reemployment is unaffected.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) If you wish to participate in premium conversion, you must notify your employing agency.

              <P>(a) The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for regulating eligibility for obtaining medical and dental care under the TRICARE Program, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. chapter 55. The FEDVIP laws at 5 U.S.C. chapter 89A was amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, Public Law 114-328, to allow individuals who were eligible for coverage under the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program <PRTPAGE P="615"/>(TRDP) in accordance with DOD rules to obtain dental coverage in a FEDVIP dental plan. Public Law 114-328 also added a provision allowing certain individuals who are concurrently enrolled for medical care in specified TRICARE health plans to obtain FEDVIP vision coverage.</P>

              <P>(b) Categories of individuals who were eligible for TRDP and who are eligible to be covered under a FEDVIP dental plan are set forth in § 894.802. Categories of individuals who may be covered under specified TRICARE health plans and, if so covered, are eligible to be covered under a FEDVIP vision plan, are set forth in § 894.803. Individuals eligible for FEDVIP coverage are referred to as <E T="03">TRICARE eligible individuals (TEI).</E>
              </P>
              <P>(c)(1) FEDVIP rules provide an <E T="03">enrollee</E> with the right to select:</P>
              <P>(i) A dental and/or a vision plan; and</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Type of enrollment</E> that may cover the eligible individual in a self only enrollment or the eligible individual with one or more <E T="03">family members</E> in a self plus one or self and family enrollment.</P>
              <P>(2) For <E T="03">TRICARE eligible individuals (TEI),</E> this means that:</P>
              <P>(i) If the <E T="03">sponsor</E> is both a <E T="03">TEI</E> and enrolled, the <E T="03">sponsor</E> may be an <E T="03">enrollee</E> and may cover the <E T="03">sponsor</E> and <E T="03">TEI family members</E> under the plan.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a <E T="03">sponsor</E> is not eligible to enroll (or pursuant to § 894.309(a)(3)(iii) is not enrolled), a <E T="03">TEI</E> who is a <E T="03">TEI family member</E> may self-certify to serve as <E T="03">enrollee</E> instead, and may cover other <E T="03">TEI family members.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(d) If a FEDVIP dental or vision plan has a specific geographic enrollment area, <E T="03">TEI family members</E> must live or work in that area in order to be enrolled for coverage. An <E T="03">enrollee</E> whose <E T="03">TEI family members</E> are located in different geographic locations may select a plan that is nationwide/international in scope in order to obtain accessible coverage.</P>

Note however, that a <E T="03">TEI family member</E> may seek reconsideration of an erroneous enrollment under § 894.104, and the <E T="03">Administrator</E> and OPM retain authority to correct enrollments under § 894.105.</P>

              <P>Yes, you are eligible to enroll in a FEDVIP vision plan only. A <E T="03">TEI former spouse</E> is not eligible to enroll in a FEDVIP dental plan. You are a <E T="03">TEI-V,</E> and you are an <E T="03">enrollee,</E> however your <E T="03">type of enrollment</E> is limited to self only.

              <P>Yes, as <E T="03">sponsor,</E> you must notify the <E T="03">Administrator</E> and your <E T="03">TEI family members</E> of changes in your eligibility and enrollment status. Status as an <E T="03">enrollee,</E> with a right to the enrollment, depends upon your <E T="03">sponsor</E> status and eligibility as a <E T="03">TEI,</E> and the enrollment action you have taken. Failure to notify the <E T="03">Administrator</E> and your <E T="03">TEI family members</E> of a change in status within the uniformed services that affects your eligibility to enroll may result in invalid continued enrollment, or an unexpected termination of enrollment, for your <E T="03">TEI family members,</E> for which you will be responsible.</P>

Upon a change in your status causing you to no longer satisfy one of the conditions, your <E T="03">TEI certifying family member</E> is no longer the <E T="03">enrollee,</E> and you must notify the <E T="03">Administrator.</E> The <E T="03">Administrator</E> will send your <E T="03">TEI certifying family member</E> notice that their enrollment is terminated, and notify them that their <E T="03">sponsor</E> (<E T="03">i.e.</E> you), may enroll, and may cover <E T="03">TEI family members</E> on the new enrollment.</P>

              <P>(a) This subpart applies to each program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by OPM, including the federally assisted programs listed in appendix A to this subpart. It also applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended under a program after the effective date of this subpart pursuant to an application approved before that effective date. This subpart does not apply to:</P>

              <P>(2) Money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended under a program before the effective date of this subpart, except when the assistance was subject to the title VI regulations of an agency whose responsibilities are now exercised by OPM;</P>

              <P>(4) Employment practices, under a program, of an employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in § 900.404(c).</P>
              <FP>The fact that a program is not listed in appendix A to this subpart does not mean, if title VI is otherwise applicable, that the program is not covered. Other programs under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to appendix A to this subpart.</FP>
              <P>(b) In a program receiving Federal financial assistance in the form, or for the acquisition, of real property or an interest in real property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under that property are included as part of the program receiving that assistance, the nondiscrimination requirement of this subpart extends to a facility located wholly or in part in that space.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A person in the United States shall not, on the ground of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under, a program to which this subpart applies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.</E> (1) A recipient under a program to which this subpart applies may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or national origin—</P>
              <P>(i) Deny a person a service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide a service, financial aid, or other benefit to a person which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;</P>
              <P>(iii) Subject a person to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of a service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
              <P>(iv) Restrict a person in any way in the enjoyment of an advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving a service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
              <P>(v) Treat a person differently from others in determining whether he satisfies an admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership, or other requirement or condition which persons must meet in order to be provided a service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Deny a person an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program.</P>
              <P>(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under a program or the class of persons to whom, or the situations in which, the services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under a program, or the class of persons to be afforded an opportunity to participate in a program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting persons to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program with respect to individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
              <P>(3) As used in this section, the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance include a service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.</P>
              <P>(4) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Examples demonstrating the application of the provisions of this section to certain programs receiving Federal financial assistance from OPM are contained in appendix C of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(6) (i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient had previously discriminated against persons <PRTPAGE P="623"/>on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient shall take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.</P>
              <P>(ii) Even in the absence of prior discrimination a recipient in administering a program shall take affirmative action as required by OPM to overcome the effect of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
              <P>(iii) Any affirmative action under this paragraph shall be consistent with the principles stated in the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1909.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Employment practices.</E> (1) When a primary objective of a program of Federal financial assistance to which this subpart applies is to provide employment, a recipient or other party subject to this subpart shall not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject a person to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under the program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, hiring, firing, upgrading, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, rates of pay, or other forms of compensation or benefits, selection for training or apprenticeship, use of facilities, and treatment of employees). A recipient shall take affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to race, color, or national origin. The requirements applicable to construction employment under a program are those specified in or pursuant to Part III of Executive Order 11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.</P>
              <P>(2) Federal financial assistance to programs under laws funded or administered by OPM which have as a primary objective the providing of employment include those set forth in appendix B to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) In regard to Federal financial assistance which does not have providing employment as a primary objective, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply to the employment practices of the recipient if discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude persons from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under, the program receiving Federal financial assistance. The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to and nondiscriminatory treatment of beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(d) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under, a program to which this subpart applies, on the ground of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishments of the objectives of title VI or this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Assurances required.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) An application for Federal financial assistance to carry out a program to which this subpart applies, except a program to which paragraph (d) of this section applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by, assurances that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with the requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart. Every program of Federal financial assistance shall require the submission of these assurances. In the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, the assurances shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In other cases, the assurances obligate <PRTPAGE P="624"/>the recipient for the period during which the Federal financial assistance is extended to the program. In the case where the assistance is sought for the construction of a facility or part of a facility, the assurances shall extend to the entire facility and to the facilities operated in connection therewith. OPM shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances for each program, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants in the program. The assurances shall include provisions which give the United States the right to seek judicial enforcement.</P>
              <P>(2) When Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property, structures, or improvements thereon, or interest therein, from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. When no transfer of property or interest therein from the Federal Government is involved, but property is acquired or improved under a program of Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include a covenant in any subsequent transfer of the property. When the property is obtained from the Federal Government, the covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by OPM to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of OPM, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the program under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In the event a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, OPM may agree, on request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish the financing, and on conditions as he deems appropriate, to subordinate a right of reversion to the lien of a mortgage or other encumbrance.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Assurances from government agencies.</E> In the case of an application from a department, agency, or office of a State or local government for Federal financial assistance for a specified purpose, the assurance required by this section shall extend to any other department, agency, or office of the same governmental unit if the policies of the other department, agency, or office will substantially affect the project for which Federal financial assistance is requested. That requirement may be waived by the responsible OPM official if the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the responsible OPM official, that the practices in other agencies or parts or programs of the governmental unit will in no way affect (1) its practices in the program for which Federal financial assistance is sought, or (2) the beneficiaries of or participants in or persons affected by the program, or (3) full compliance with this subpart as respects the program.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Assurance from academic and other institutions.</E> (1) In the case of an application for Federal financial assistance by an academic institution, the assurance required by this section extends to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.</P>

              <P>(2) The assurance required by an academic institution, detention or correctional facility, or any other institution or facility, relating to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as students, patients, wards, inmates, persons subject to control, or clients of the institution or facility or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services, disposition, treatment, or benefits to these individuals, is applicable to the entire institution or facility unless the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the responsible OPM official, that the practices in designated parts or programs of the institution or facility will in no way affect its practices in the program of the institution or facility for which Federal financial assistance is sought, or the beneficiaries of or participants in the <PRTPAGE P="625"/>program. If the assistance sought is for the construction of a facility or part of a facility, the assurance shall extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Continuing State programs.</E> Every application by a State or a State agency to carry out a program involving continuing Federal financial assistance to which this subpart applies (including the programs listed in appendix A to this subpart) shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application (1) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with the requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart, and (2) provide or be accompanied by provision for methods of administration for the program as are found by OPM to give reasonable guarantee that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance under the program will comply with the requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance reports.</E> Each recipient shall keep records and submit to OPM timely, complete, and accurate compliance reports at the times, and in the form and containing the information OPM may determine necessary to enable it to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this subpart. In the case of a program under which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to other recipients, the other recipients shall also submit compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this subpart.</P>

When information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of another agency, institution, or person and this agency, institution, or person fails or refuses to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Information to beneficiaries and participants.</E> Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons the information regarding the provisions of this subpart and its applicability to the program under which the recipient received Federal financial assistance, and make this information available to them in the manner, as OPM finds necessary, to apprise the persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by title VI and this subpart.</P>

A complaint shall be filed not later than 90 days after the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by OPM.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Investigations.</E> OPM will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this subpart.

              <P>(1) OPM has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by informal voluntary means;</P>
              <P>(2) There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this subpart;</P>

This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of OPM that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated time and place. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set is deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of title VI and § 900.408(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of the information as is available.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The purpose of these regulations is to implement provisions of title II of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, as amended, relating to Federally required merit personnel systems in State and local agencies, in a manner that recognizes fully the rights, powers, and responsibilities of State and local governments and encourages innovation and allows for diversity among State and local governments in the design, execution, and management of their systems of personnel administration, as provided by that Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Certain Federal grant programs require, as a condition of eligibility, that State and local agencies that receive grants establish merit personnel systems for their personnel engaged in administration of the grant-aided program. These merit personnel systems are in some cases required by specific Federal grant statutes and in other cases are required by regulations of the Federal grantor agencies. Title II of the Act gives the U.S. Office of Personnel Management authority to prescribe standards for these Federally required merit personnel systems.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Sections 900.603-604 apply to those State and local governments that are required to operate merit personnel systems as a condition of eligibility for Federal assistance or participation in an intergovernmental program. Merit personnel systems are required for State and local personnel engaged in the administration of assistance and other intergovernmental programs, irrespective of the source of funds for their salaries, where Federal laws or regulations require the establishment and maintenance of such systems. A reasonable number of positions, however, may be exempted from merit personnel system coverage.</P>
              <P>(b) Section 900.605 applies to Federal agencies that operate Federal assistance or intergovernmental programs.</P>

              <P>(c) Training employees, as needed, to assure high quality performance.</P>
              <P>(d) Retaining employees on the basis of the adequacy of their performance, correcting inadequate performance, and separating employees whose inadequate performance cannot be corrected.</P>
              <P>(e) Assuring fair treatment of applicants and employees in all aspects of personnel administration without regard to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as defined by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended), disability, genetic information (including family medical history), marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, status as parent, labor organization affiliation or nonaffiliation in accordance with chapter 71 of title V, or any other non-merit-based factor, or retaliation for exercising rights with respect to the categories enumerated above, where retaliation rights are available, and with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights as citizens. This “fair treatment” principle includes compliance with the Federal equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination laws.</P>
              <P>(f) Assuring that employees are protected against coercion for partisan political purposes and are prohibited from using their official authority for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election or a nomination for office.</P>

              <P>(2) Chief executives will maintain these certifications and make them available to the Office of Personnel Management.</P>
              <P>(3) In the absence of certification by the chief executive, compliance with the Standards may be certified by the heads of those State and local agencies that are required to have merit personnel systems as a condition of Federal assistance or other intergovernmental programs.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Resolution of Compliance Issues.</E> (1) Chief executives of State and local jurisdictions operating covered programs are responsible for supervising compliance by personnel systems in their jurisdictions with the Standards. They shall resolve all questions regarding compliance by personnel systems in their jurisdictions with the Standards. Findings and supporting documentation with regard to specific compliance issues shall be maintained by the chief executive, or a personal designee, and shall be forwarded, on request, to the Office of Personnel Management.</P>
              <P>(2) The merit principles apply to systems of personnel administration. The Intergovernmental Personnel Act does not authorize OPM to exercise any authority, direction or control over the selection, assignment, advancement, retention, compensation, or other personnel action with respect to any individual State or local employee.</P>
              <P>(3) When a chief executive requests the assistance of the Office of Personnel Management, the Office will provide consultation and technical advice to aid the State or local government in complying with the Standards.</P>
              <P>(4) The Office of Personnel Management will advise Federal agencies on application of the Standards in resolving compliance issues and will recommend actions to carry out the purposes of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act.

              <SUBJECT>Program accessibility.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) No qualified handicapped person shall, because a recipient's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by <PRTPAGE P="635"/>handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity to which this subpart applies.</P>
              <P>(b) A recipient shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of an existing facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Where structural changes are necessary to make programs or activities in existing facilities accessible, such changes shall be made as soon as practicable, but in no event later than three years after the effective date of the regulation.</P>
              <P>(c) A recipient may comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, alteration of facilities or any other methods that result in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section.</P>
              <P>(d) New facilities shall be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Alterations to existing facilities shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>(e) In the event that structural changes to facilities are necessary to meet the requirements of this section, a recipient shall develop within 12 months of the effective date of this subpart a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>(f)(1) Effective as of August 23, 1990. Design, construction, or alteration of buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the building is provided.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.</P>
              <P>(3) This section does not require recipients to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Employment practices.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under a program or activity that receives or benefits from Federal financial assistance from OPM.</P>
              <P>(2) A recipient shall make all decisions concerning employment under any program or activity to which this subpart applies in a manner which ensures that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur and may not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way that adversely affects their opportunities or status because of handicap.</P>
              <P>(3) The prohibition against discrimination in employment applies to the following activities:</P>
              <P>(i) Recruitment, advertising, and the processing of applications for employment;</P>

              <P>(ii) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff, and rehiring;<PRTPAGE P="636"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in compensation;</P>
              <P>(iv) Job assignments, job classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists;</P>
              <P>(v) Leaves of absence, sick leave, or any other leave;</P>
              <P>(vi) Fringe benefits available by virtue of employment, whether or not administered by the recipient;</P>
              <P>(vii) Selection and financial support for training, including apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related activities, and selection for leaves of absence to pursue training;</P>
              <P>(viii) Employer sponsored activities, including social or recreational programs; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.</P>
              <P>(4) A recipient may not participate in a contractual or other relationship that has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this subpart. The relationships referred to in this paragraph include relationships with employment and referral agencies, with labor unions, with organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient, and with organizations providing training and apprenticeship programs.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reasonable accommodation.</E> (1) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped applicant or employee under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from OPM unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program.</P>
              <P>(2) Reasonable accommodation may include, but shall not be limited to, making facilities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, the provision of readers and interpreters, job restructuring and providing part-time or modified work schedules and other similar actions.</P>
              <P>(3) In determining pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the recipient in question, factors to be considered by OPM include:</P>
              <P>(i) The overall size of the recipient's program with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities and size of budget;</P>
              <P>(ii) The type of operation, including the composition and structure of the work force; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The nature and the cost of the accommodation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Employment criteria.</E> (1) A recipient involved in activities receiving Federal financial assistance may not make use of any employment test or other selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out handicapped persons or any class of handicapped persons in any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance unless the test score or other selection criterion, as used by the recipient, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and alternative job-related tests or criteria that do not screen out as many handicapped persons are not shown by the Office of Personnel Management's Personnel Research and Development Center to be available.</P>
              <P>(2) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning employment so as to ensure that, when administered under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance from OPM, to an applicant or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or employee's ability to perform the duties of the type of position in question rather than reflecting the applicant's or employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Preemployment inquiries.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a recipient, when considering an applicant for employment under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from OPM, may not conduct a preemployment medical examination and may not make preemployment inquiry of an applicant as <PRTPAGE P="637"/>to whether the applicant is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a handicap. A recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.</P>

              <P>(2) Nothing in this section shall prohibit an organization from conditioning an offer of employment under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from OPM on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That (i) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of handicap or when a preemployment medical questionnaire used for positions which do not routinely require medical examination indicates a condition for which further examination is required because of the job-related nature of the condition; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The results of such an examination are used in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.</P>

The assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which the financial assistance is extended to the program.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Certification from subgrantees.</E> A certification shall be required of all subgrantees receiving financial assistance from OPM to the effect that all programs or parts thereof carried out by subgrantees shall be in compliance with the requirements of this subpart.

              <P>(a) Each recipient shall, within one year of the receipt of financial assistance, conduct or have conducted an evaluation of its compliance with this subpart with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons. Each such recipient shall evaluate its current policies and practices and their effects, and modify any that do not meet the requirements of this part. Each such recipient shall permit the Office of Personnel Management, during normal business hours, to examine its self-evaluation along with its books, records, accounts, facilities and other sources of information as may be useful to determine whether there has been compliance with this subpart. Self-evaluation required under other Federal programs may be accepted by OPM if the information pertaining to activities receiving financial assistance from OPM is included and the records are available to OPM representatives.</P>
              <P>(b) Each recipient shall modify, after consultation with interested persons and organizations, including handicapped persons, any policies and practices that do not meet the requirements of this subpart; and</P>
              <P>(c) Each recipient shall take, after consultation with interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, appropriate remedial steps to eliminate the effects of any discrimination that resulted from adherence to these policies and practices.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How is this part written?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This part uses a “plain language” format to make it easier for the general public and business community to use. The section headings and text, often in the form of questions and answers, must be read together.</P>
            <P>(b) Pronouns used within this part, such as “I” and “you,” change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being addressed. The pronoun “we” always is the OPM.</P>
            <P>(c) The “Covered Transactions” diagram in the appendix to this part shows the levels or “tiers” at which the OPM enforces an exclusion under this part.</P>

            <P>This part uses terms throughout the text that have special meaning. Those terms are defined in Subpart I of this part. For example, three important terms are—</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Exclusion or excluded,</E> which refers only to discretionary actions taken by a suspending or debarring official under this part or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4);</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Disqualification or disqualified,</E> which refers to prohibitions under specific statutes, executive orders (other than Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of an agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Ineligibility or ineligible,</E> which generally refers to a person who is either excluded or disqualified.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What does this part do?</SUBJECT>
              <P>This part adopts a governmentwide system of debarment and suspension for OPM nonprocurement activities. It also provides for reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and provides for the consolidated listing of all persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order, or other legal authority. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).</P>

              </P>
              <P>(b) Respondent (a person against whom the OPM has initiated a debarment or suspension action);</P>
              <P>(c) OPM debarring or suspending official; or</P>
              <P>(d) OPM official who is authorized to enter into covered transactions with non-Federal parties.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with responsible persons.</P>
              <P>(b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not presently responsible.</P>
              <P>(c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does an exclusion restrict a person's involvement in covered transactions?</SUBJECT>
              <P>With the exceptions stated in §§ 919.120, 919.315, and 919.420, a person who is excluded by the OPM or any other Federal agency may not:</P>
              <P>(a) Be a participant in a(n) OPM transaction that is a covered transaction under subpart B of this part;</P>
              <P>(b) Be a participant in a transaction of any other Federal agency that is a covered transaction under that agency's regulation for debarment and suspension; or</P>
              <P>(c) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those covered transactions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>May we grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Debarring Official may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. If the Debarring Official grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.</P>
              <P>(b) An exception granted by one agency for an excluded person does not extend to the covered transactions of another agency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?</SUBJECT>
              <P>If any Federal agency excludes a person under its nonprocurement common rule on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in Federal procurement transactions under the FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in Federal procurement transactions.</P>

              <P>If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in nonprocurement covered transactions under this part. Therefore, an exclusion under the FAR has reciprocal effect in Federal nonprocurement transactions.</P>

              <P>Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, we may exclude any person who has been involved, is currently involved, or may reasonably be expected to be involved in a covered transaction.</P>

              <P>Check the <E T="03">Excluded Parties List System (EPLS)</E> to determine whether a person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains the <E T="03">EPLS</E> and makes it available, as detailed in subpart E of this part. When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into the <E T="03">EPLS.</E>

              <P>Except if provided for in Subpart J of this part, this part—</P>
              <P>(a) Addresses disqualified persons only to—</P>
              <P>(1) Provide for their inclusion in the <E T="03">EPLS;</E> and</P>
              <P>(2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to check for disqualified persons before entering into covered transactions.</P>
              <P>(b) Does not specify the—</P>
              <P>(1) OPM transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation that caused the disqualification;</P>
              <P>(2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or</P>
              <P>(3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action that a Federal agency takes.</P>

              <P>The importance of a covered transaction depends upon who you are.</P>
              <P>(a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in Subpart C of this part.

              <SUBJECT>Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:</P>
              <P>(a) A direct award to—</P>
              <P>(1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;</P>
              <P>(2) A public international organization;</P>
              <P>(3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or</P>
              <P>(4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.</P>

              <P>(b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.</P>
              <P>(c) Federal employment.<PRTPAGE P="645"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) A transaction that the OPM needs to respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.</P>
              <P>(e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless the OPM specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.</P>
              <P>(f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.</P>
              <P>(g) Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Covered transactions under this part—</P>
              <P>(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but</P>
              <P>(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to this part).</P>
              <P>(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:</P>
              <P>(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 919.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.</P>
              <P>(2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) OPM official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.</P>
              <P>(3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.</P>

              <P>Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose suspension only when that official determines that—</P>
              <P>(a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to suspect, an offense listed under § 919.800(a), or</P>
              <P>(b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for debarment listed under § 919.800(b) through (d); and</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 919.705</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents.</P>
              <P>(b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions.</P>
              <P>(c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.</P>

              <P>(4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-finding.</P>

              <P>This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:</P>
              <P>(a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.</P>
              <P>(b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.</P>
              <P>(c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.</P>
              <P>(d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.</P>
              <P>(e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.</P>
              <P>(f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing.</P>
              <P>(g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.</P>
              <P>(h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.</P>
              <P>(i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.</P>
              <P>(j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.</P>
              <P>(k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.</P>
              <P>(l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence.</P>
              <P>(m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.</P>
              <P>(n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner.</P>
              <P>(o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.</P>
              <P>(p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.</P>
              <P>(q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment.</P>

              <P>(1) The employee has competitive status or is serving in an excepted position under a permanent appointment;</P>
              <P>(2) The employee is serving in an administrative law judge position on the day the legislation, Executive order, or decision of the court on which the classification of the position is based becomes effective;</P>
              <P>(3) OPM receives a recommendation for the employee's appointment from the agency concerned; and</P>

              <P>(4) OPM determines the employee meets the qualification requirements <PRTPAGE P="667"/>and has passed the current examination for an administrative law judge position.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Administrative law judge pay system.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) OPM assigns each administrative law judge position to one of the three levels of basic pay, AL-3, AL-2 or AL-1 of the administrative law judge pay system established under 5 U.S.C. 5372 in accordance with this section. Pay level AL-3 has six rates of basic pay, A, B, C, D, E, and F.</P>
              <P>(1) The rate of basic pay for AL-3, rate A, may not be less than 65 percent of the rate of basic pay for level IV of the Executive Schedule. The rate of basic pay for AL-1 may not exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule.</P>
              <P>(2) The President determines the appropriate adjustment for each level in the administrative law judge pay system, subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Such adjustments take effect on the 1st day of the first pay period beginning on or after the first day of the month in which adjustments in the General Schedule rates of basic pay under 5 U.S.C. 5303 take effect.</P>
              <P>(3) An agency must use the following procedures to convert an administrative law judge's annual rate of basic pay to an hourly, daily, weekly, or biweekly rate:</P>
              <P>(i) To derive an hourly rate, divide the annual rate of pay by 2,087 and round to the nearest cent, counting one-half cent and over as the next higher cent.</P>
              <P>(ii) To derive a daily rate, multiply the hourly rate by the number of daily hours of service required by the administrative law judge's basic daily tour of duty.</P>
              <P>(iii) To derive a weekly or biweekly rate, multiply the hourly rate by 40 or 80, respectively.</P>
              <P>(b) Pay level AL-3 is the basic pay level for administrative law judge positions filled through a competitive examination.</P>
              <P>(c) Subject to OPM approval, agencies may establish administrative law judge positions in pay levels AL-2 and AL-1. Administrative law judge positions are placed at these levels when they involve significant administrative and managerial responsibilities.</P>
              <P>(d) Administrative law judges must serve at least 1 year in each AL pay level, or in an equivalent or higher level in positions in the Federal service, before advancing to the next higher level and may advance only one level at a time.</P>

              <P>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, upon appointment to an administrative law judge position <PRTPAGE P="668"/>and placement in level AL-3, an administrative law judge is paid at the minimum rate A of AL-3. He or she is automatically advanced successively to rates B, C, and D of that level upon completion of 52 weeks of service in the next lower rate, and to rates E and F of that level upon completion of 104 weeks of service in the next lower rate. Time in a non-pay status is generally creditable service when computing the 52-or 104-week period as long as it does not exceed 2 weeks per year for each 52 weeks of service. However, absence due to uniformed service or compensable injury is fully creditable upon reemployment as provided in part 353 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(f) Upon appointment to a position at AL-3, an administrative law judge may be paid at the minimum rate A, unless the administrative law judge is eligible for the higher rate B, C, D, E, or F because of prior service or superior qualifications, as provided in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) An agency may offer an administrative law judge applicant with prior Federal service a higher than minimum rate up to the lowest rate of basic pay that equals or exceeds the applicant's highest previous Federal rate of basic pay, not to exceed the maximum rate F.</P>
              <P>(2) With prior OPM approval, an agency may pay the rate of pay that is next above the applicant's existing pay or earnings up to the maximum rate F. The agency may offer a higher than minimum rate to:</P>
              <P>(i) An administrative law judge applicant with superior qualifications (as defined in § 930.202) who is within reach for appointment from an administrative law judge certificate of eligibles; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A former administrative law judge with superior qualifications who is eligible for reinstatement.</P>
              <P>(g) With prior OPM approval, an agency, on a one-time basis, may advance an administrative law judge in an AL-3 position with added administrative and managerial duties and responsibilities one rate above the administrative law judge's current AL-3 pay rate, up to the maximum rate F.</P>
              <P>(h) Upon appointment to an administrative law judge position placed at AL-2 or AL-1, an administrative law judge is paid at the established rate for the level.</P>
              <P>(i) An employing agency may reduce the level or rate of basic pay of an administrative law judge under § 930.211.</P>
              <P>(j) With prior OPM approval, an employing agency may reduce the level of basic pay of an administrative law judge if the administrative law judge submits to the employing agency a written request for a voluntary reduction due to personal reasons.</P>

              <P>(c) An agency may assign an administrative law judge to perform non-administrative law judge duties only when:</P>
              <P>(1) The other duties are consistent with administrative law judge duties and responsibilities;</P>
              <P>(2) The assignment is to last no longer than 120 days; and</P>
              <P>(3) The administrative law judge has not had a total of more than 120 days of such assignments or details within the preceding 12 months.</P>

              <P>(d) OPM may authorize a waiver of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section if an agency shows that it is in the public interest to do so. In determining whether a waiver is justified, OPM may consider, but is not restricted to considering, such factors as unusual case <PRTPAGE P="669"/>load or special expertise of the detailee.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Administrative Law Judge Loan Program—detail to other agencies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3344, OPM administers an Administrative Law Judge Loan Program that coordinates the loan/detail of an administrative law judge from one agency to another. An agency may request from OPM the services of an administrative law judge if the agency is occasionally or temporarily insufficiently staffed with administrative law judges, or an agency may loan the services of its administrative law judges to other agencies if there is insufficient work to fully occupy the administrative law judges' work schedule.</P>
              <P>(b) An agency's request to OPM for the services of an administrative law judge must:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify and briefly describe the nature of the cases(s) to be heard;</P>
              <P>(2) Specify the legal authority for which the use of an administrative law judge is required; and</P>
              <P>(3) Demonstrate, as appropriate, that the agency has no administrative law judge available to hear the case(s).</P>
              <P>(c) The services of an administrative law judge under this program are made from the starting date of the detail until the end of the current fiscal year, but may be extended into the next fiscal year with OPM's approval. Decisions for an extension are made by OPM on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(d) The agency requesting the services of an administrative law judge under this program is responsible for reimbursing the agency that employs the administrative law judge for the cost of the service.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Senior Administrative Law Judge Program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) OPM administers a Senior Administrative Law Judge Program in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3323(b)(2). The Senior Administrative Law Judge Program is subject to the requirements and limitations in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) A senior administrative law judge must meet the:</P>
              <P>(1) Annuitant requirements under 5 U.S.C. 3323;</P>
              <P>(2) Professional license requirement in § 930.204(b); and</P>
              <P>(3) Investigations and suitability requirements in part 731 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) Under the Senior Administrative Law Judge Program, OPM authorizes agencies that have temporary, irregular workload requirements for conducting proceedings in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557 to temporarily reemploy administrative law judge annuitants. If OPM is unable to identify an administrative law judge under § 930.208 who meets the agency's qualification requirements, OPM will approve the agency's request.</P>
              <P>(d) An agency wishing to temporarily reemploy an administrative law judge must submit a written request to OPM. The request must:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify the statutory authority under which the administrative law judge is expected to conduct proceedings;</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate the agency's temporary or irregular workload requirements for conducting proceedings;</P>
              <P>(3) Specify the tour of duty, location, period of time, or particular cases(s) for the requested reemployment; and</P>
              <P>(4) Describe any special qualifications the retired administrative law judge possesses that are required of the position, such as experience in a particular field, agency, or substantive area of law.</P>
              <P>(e) OPM establishes the terms of the appointment for a senior administrative law judge. The senior administrative law judge may be reemployed either for a specified period not to exceed 1 year or for such time as may be necessary for the senior administrative law judge to conduct and complete the hearing and issue decisions for one or more specified cases. Upon agency request, OPM may reduce or extend such period of reemployment, as necessary, to coincide with changing staffing requirements.</P>
              <P>(f) A senior administrative law judge serves subject to the same limitations as any other administrative law judge employed under this subpart and 5 U.S.C. 3105.</P>

              <P>(g) A senior administrative law judge is paid the rate of basic pay for the pay level at which the position has been classified. If the position is classified <PRTPAGE P="670"/>at pay level AL-3, the senior administrative law judge is paid the lowest rate of basic pay in AL-3 that equals or exceeds the highest previous rate of basic pay attained by the individual as an administrative law judge immediately before retirement, up to the maximum rate F.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Retention preference regulations.</E> Except as modified by this section, the reduction in force regulations in part 351 of this chapter apply to administrative law judges.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of retention standing.</E> In determining retention standing in a reduction in force, each agency lists its administrative law judges by group and subgroup according to tenure of employment, veterans' preference, and service date as outlined in part 351 of this chapter. Because administrative law judges are not given performance ratings (see § 930.206), the provisions in part 351 of this chapter referring to the effect of performance ratings on retention standing are not applicable to administrative law judges.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Placement assistance.</E> (1) An administrative law judge who is reached in an agency's reduction in force and receives a notification of separation is eligible for placement assistance under the agency's reemployment priority list established and maintained in accordance with subpart B of part 330 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) An administrative law judge who is reached by an agency in a reduction in force and who is notified of being separated, furloughed for more than 30 days, or demoted, is entitled to have his or her name placed on OPM's administrative law judge priority referral list for the level in which last served and for all lower levels.</P>
              <P>(i) To have his or her name placed on the OPM priority referral list, a displaced administrative law judge must provide OPM with a request for priority referral placement, a resume or equivalent, a list of acceptable geographical locations, and a copy of the reduction in force notice at any time after the receipt of the specific reduction in force notice, but not later than 90 days after the date of separation, furlough for more than 30 days, or demotion.</P>
              <P>(ii) Eligibility on the OPM priority referral list expires 2 years after the effective date of the reduction in force action.</P>
              <P>(iii) Referral and selection of administrative law judges are made without regard to selective certification or special qualification procedures.</P>
              <P>(iv) Termination of eligibility on the OPM priority referral list takes place when an administrative law judge submits a written request to terminate eligibility, accepts a permanent full-time administrative law judge position, or declines one full-time employment offer as an administrative law judge at or above the level held when reached for reduction in force at geographic locations indicated as acceptable under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) When there is no administrative law judge available on the agency's reemployment priority list, an agency may fill a vacant administrative law judge position only from OPM's priority referral list, unless the agency obtains prior approval from OPM to fill the vacant position through competitive examining, promotion, transfer, reassignment, or reinstatement procedures. OPM will grant such approvals only under extraordinary circumstances. The agency must demonstrate that the potential administrative law judge candidate possesses experience and qualifications superior to any available displaced administrative law judge on OPM's priority referral list.</P>

              <P>(1) Assign the administrative law judge to duties consistent with his or her normal duties in which these circumstances would not exist;</P>
              <P>(2) Place the administrative law judge on leave with his or her consent;</P>
              <P>(3) Carry the administrative law judge on annual leave, sick leave, leave without pay, or absence without leave, as appropriate, if he or she is voluntarily absent for reasons not originating with the agency; or</P>
              <P>(4) If the alternatives in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section are not available, the agency may consider placing the administrative law judge in a paid non-duty or administrative leave status.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope of the Combined Federal Campaign.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The CFC is the only authorized solicitation of employees in the Federal workplace on behalf of charitable organizations. A campaign may be conducted only during the period running from September 1 through January 15, as determined by the Director. It must be conducted at every Federal agency in accordance with the regulations in this part. No other monetary solicitation on behalf of charitable organizations may be conducted in the Federal workplace, except as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Federal agencies must provide information about the CFC to new employees at orientation. New employees may make pledges within 30 days of entry on duty, if outside of the campaign period.</P>
              <P>(2) The Director may grant permission for solicitations of Federal employees, outside the CFC, in support of victims in cases of emergencies and disasters. Emergencies and disasters are defined as any hurricane, tornado storm, flood, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, drought, fire, explosion, or other catastrophe in any part of the world. Any special solicitations will be managed through a Disaster Relief Program developed by OPM.</P>

              <P>(b) The regulations in this part do not apply to the collection of gifts-in-kind, such as food, clothing and toys, <PRTPAGE P="674"/>or to the solicitation of Federal employees outside of the Federal workplace as defined by the applicable Agency Head consistent with General Services Administration regulations and any other applicable laws or regulations.</P>
              <P>(c) The Director may exercise general supervision over all operations of the CFC, and take all necessary steps to ensure the achievement of campaign objectives, including but not limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Any disputes relating to the interpretation or implementation of this part may be submitted to the Director for resolution. The decisions of the Director are final for administrative purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) The Director may audit, investigate, and report on the administration of any campaign, the organization that administers the campaign, and any national, international and local federation, federation member or independent organization that participates in the campaign for compliance with these regulations. The Director may resolve any issues reported and assess sanctions or penalties, as warranted under § 950.503.</P>
              <P>(d) Current Federal civilian and active duty military employees may make contributions using payroll deduction or by electronic means, including credit/debit cards and e-checks, as approved by the Director. Contractor personnel, credit union employees and other persons present on Federal premises, as well as retired Federal employees, may make single contributions to the CFC by electronic means, including credit cards, as approved by the Director. For the first five campaign periods after implementation of these regulations, LFCCs will be permitted to still provide donors the option of using non-electronic pledging based on guidance issued by OPM.</P>
              <P>(e) Heads of departments or agencies may establish policies and procedures applicable to solicitations conducted by organizations composed of civilian employees or members of the uniformed services among their own members for organizational support or for the benefit of welfare funds for their members. Such solicitations are not subject to these regulations, and therefore do not require permission of the Director.</P>

              <P>(a) The Director, in his or her sole discretion, will establish, maintain, and, from time to time, revise an official list of campaign zones.</P>
              <P>(b) For each campaign zone, the Director will establish a Local Federal Coordinating Committee (LFCC) for the purpose of governing the campaign for that zone. It will be the responsibility of the Federal Executive Board or lead agency (as identified by the Director) in the zone to ensure an active and diverse membership, with a minimum of three members. The LFCC shall consist of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Members to be drawn from local Federal inter-agency organizations, such as Federal Executive Boards, or from personnel assigned to the military installation and/or agency identified as the lead agency in that zone;</P>
              <P>(2) Representation from local Federal Agencies located within the zone, representing a cross-section of agencies with regard to personnel types and locations; and</P>
              <P>(3) If approved by the Director, representatives of employee unions and other employee groups.</P>
              <P>(c) The members of each LFCC must select a Chair and a Vice Chair. The Chair and Vice Chair positions will be rotated among the LFCC members. The term of the Chair and Vice Chair may not exceed three consecutive years. Any LFCC Chair or Vice Chair is subject to removal by the Director, in his sole and unreviewable discretion.</P>
              <P>(d) The LFCC will ensure that, to the extent reasonably possible, every employee is given the opportunity to participate in the CFC.</P>

              <P>(8) Bring any allegations of potential donor coercion to the attention of the employee's agency and provide a mechanism to review employee complaints of undue coercion in Federal fundraising. Federal agencies shall provide procedures and assign responsibility for the investigation of such complaints. The agency official responsible for conducting the campaign is responsible for informing employees of the proper channels for pursuing such complaints.</P>
              <P>(9) Notify the Director of issues concerning the campaign that the LFCC cannot resolve by applying these regulations. The LFCC must abide by the Director's decisions on all matters concerning the campaign.</P>
              <P>(10) Review, approve and provide authorization to the Central Campaign Administrator for payments to the outreach coordinator in an efficient and effective manner as outlined in the agreement between OPM and the Central Campaign Administrator.</P>
              <P>(11) Conduct an effective and efficient campaign in a fair and even-handed manner aimed at collecting the greatest amount of charitable contributions possible. LFCC's should afford federated groups and agencies with representatives in the campaign area adequate opportunity to offer suggestions relating to the operation of the campaign.</P>
              <P>(c) The LFCC may hire an Outreach Coordinator to provide local operation marketing support to their campaign, including developing marketing plans and materials, employee training, campaign event and activity support, and the printing and distribution of CFC Charity Lists and pledge forms as permitted in 5 CFR § 950.102(d).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Central Campaign Administrator (CCA).</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) OPM may contract with one or more organizations classified by the Internal Revenue Service as 501(c)(3) organizations, to perform the centralized fiscal and administrative functions of the CFC. One organization will be responsible for developing and maintaining a centralized Web site for the CFC that will include an online application function for charities applying to participate in the CFC and an online pledging function for Federal donor use. All organizations will be responsible for disbursing funds received from <PRTPAGE P="676"/>the Federal payroll offices or service providers. If OPM contracts with more than one organization, the disbursement responsibilities will be divided between them based on Federal Shared Service Centers and Federal payroll offices. For example, if OPM contracts with four organizations, one would handle all agencies that use the National Finance Center as their Shared Service Center regardless of the location of the donor or the agency. Only non-CFC participating organizations may be selected as CCAs.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event that there is no qualified CCA, no workplace solicitation of any Federal employee may be authorized and CFC payroll allotments would not be accepted or honored.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Campaign expense recovery.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The costs of outreach approved by the LFCC, training and traveling for the LFCC, and CCA will be recovered through application/listing fees and/or distribution fees paid by charitable organizations . The fee structure will be determined annually by the Director based on estimated costs of administering the central campaign and local marketing efforts. This structure will be announced no later than October 31 of the year preceding the campaign. Any excess funds from applications fees over expenses will be rolled over to the following campaign and be considered when setting the rates. Marketing expenses will not exceed a percentage of receipts as determined by the Director. No expenses for food or entertainment may be reimbursed to the Outreach Coordinator. Only travel-related food expenses may be reimbursed to the LFCC in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) Charity application fees are due at the time of the filing of the application or the application deadline, whichever occurs last. A charity that has not paid the full application fee at that time may not participate in the CFC that campaign year.</P>
              <P>(c) An additional listing fee will be applied to all charities approved for participation. These charities will not be listed in paper or electronic Charity Lists, and CFC contributions will not be processed on their behalf, if they do not submit the listing fee prior to the annual date set by OPM.</P>
              <P>(d) The distribution fee will be assessed against pledges received should the application and listing fees not cover all the costs of the campaign.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preventing coercive activity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>True voluntary giving is fundamental to Federal fundraising activities. Actions that do not allow free choices or create the appearance that employees do not have a free choice to give or not to give, or to publicize their gifts or to keep them confidential, are contrary to Federal fundraising policy. Activities contrary to the non-coercive intent of Federal fundraising policy are not permitted in campaigns. They include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(a) Solicitation of employees by their supervisor or by any individual in their supervisory chain of command. This does not prohibit the head of an agency to perform the usual activities associated with the campaign kick-off and to demonstrate his or her support of the CFC in employee newsletters or other routine communications with the Federal employees.</P>
              <P>(b) Supervisory inquiries about whether an employee chose to participate or not to participate or the amount of an employee's donation. Supervisors may be given nothing more than summary information about the major units that they supervise.</P>
              <P>(c) Setting of 100 percent participation goals.</P>
              <P>(d) Establishing personal dollar goals and quotas.</P>
              <P>(e) Developing and using lists of non-contributors.</P>
              <P>(f) Providing and using contributor lists for purposes other than the routine collection and forwarding of contributions and allotments, and as allowed under § 950.501.</P>
              <P>(g) Using as a factor in a supervisor's performance appraisal the results of the solicitation in the supervisor's unit or organization.</P>

              <P>(c) A charity must submit the full application the initial year it applies to participate in the CFC. In lieu of a full application, a charity may submit a verification application for the two years immediately following its submission of a full application.</P>
              <P>(1) A verification application consists of certification of all applicable statements required by §§ 950.202 and 950.203, and submission of an IRS Form 990 or pro forma IRS Form 990, as defined in § 950.203(a)(3).</P>
              <P>(2) An organization that did not apply or was not approved for participation in the preceding campaign must submit a full application.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Charity eligibility requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The requirements for an organization to be listed in the Charity List shall include the following:</P>

              <P>(1) Certification that it provides or conducts real services, benefits, assistance, or program activities (hereafter listed as “services”), in 15 or more different states or one or more foreign countries over the 3 calendar year period immediately preceding January 1 of the campaign application year. A schedule listing a detailed description of the services in each state (minimum 15) or foreign countries (minimum 1), including the year of service and documenting the location and date and year of each service, and the number of beneficiaries of each such service must be included with the CFC application. The schedule must make a clear showing of national or international presence. Broad descriptions of services and identical repetitive narratives will not be accepted in the sole discretion of OPM if they do not allow OPM to adequately determine that real services were provided or to accurately determine the individuals or entities who benefited. It must be clear in the documentation submitted that the organization provided at least one human health and welfare service in the calendar year prior to the year for which <PRTPAGE P="678"/>the organization is applying. Publications or other documents in lieu of a schedule detailing this information are not acceptable.</P>
              <P>(i) Local charitable organizations are not required to have provided services in 15 states or a foreign country over the prior 3 years. The schedule for local organizations is only required to document services in their local area. Local organizations must also certify that the Organization Address submitted with the application is the primary location where the organization's services are rendered and/or its records are maintained.</P>
              <P>(ii) This requirement cannot be met solely by the provision of services via telephone, unless the service is emergency in nature such as a suicide prevention hotline. The requirement is also not met solely by disseminating information and publications via the U.S. Postal Service or the Internet, unless it meets the criteria for web- based services as described in § 950.202(a)(1)(iii), or a combination thereof.</P>
              <P>(iii) Real services for web-based service organizations may be considered if the organization provides service logs or other records indicating the geographic distribution of users in each state. The organization must demonstrate the scope of services received by users over the three-year period immediately preceding the start of the campaign year involved. Reports that reflect only the number of hits or visits to a Web site are not sufficient to establish the provision of real services. In addition, two of the three following types of information must be provided to demonstrate the provision of real services, benefits, assistance, or program activities:</P>
              <P>(A) Evidence that recipients, including members of the general public, dues paying members or affiliate organizations, have registered for use of the Web site;</P>
              <P>(B) Summary reports that document customer feedback, through service satisfaction or utilization surveys, demonstration of two-way communications, such as an online class, or other mechanisms; and</P>
              <P>(C) Documented evidence that recipients of web-based services paid a fee for the service.</P>
              <P>(iv) Providing listings of affiliated groups does not demonstrate provision of real services by the applicant. Location of residence of organization members or location of residence of visitors to a facility does not substantiate provision of services. Schedules that describe activities conducted by an entity other than the applicant, such as a chapter or a support group, must include information documenting the applicant's role in the delivery of the service. Details may include items such as whether the chapter is funded by the applicant or how the applicant assisted in the delivery of the service. Applications that fail to include a description of how the applicant itself provides service may result in a denial.</P>
              <P>(v) Organizations that provide student scholarships or fellowships must indicate the state in which the recipient resides, not the state of the school or place of fellowship. Mere dissemination of information does not demonstrate acceptable provision of real services.</P>

              <P>(vi) While it is not expected that an organization maintain an office in each state or foreign country, a clear showing must be made of the actual services, benefits, assistance or activities provided in each state or foreign country. Organizations that provide services in one location may only count the state in which the services are provided toward their eligibility to participate on the national charity list. However, an organization may have beneficiaries from several states and want service to those beneficiaries considered toward the 15-state requirement to participate on the national Charity List. If an organization can document that the services are subsidized or were provided free-of-charge, and list the value of those services to each of the beneficiaries, then the service to the beneficiary may be considered a service in the state of the beneficiary's residence, similar to a financial grant or scholarship. For example, a medical institution providing free housing to family members of the patient during the length of the patient's stay must list the location of the medical institution, <PRTPAGE P="679"/>the city/state of residence of each beneficiary, the dates of service, and the value of the housing provided to each beneficiary's family members.</P>
              <P>(vii) An organization's role in providing information to the media, such as authorship of an article for a newspaper, magazine, or journal, or serving as an interviewee or reference for a television news program, or the authorship of a book, does not in itself constitute a real service for CFC purposes. Likewise, the production and/or distribution of information, such as a report based on research, surveys conducted by the applicant organization, or publication of a policy position paper, does not, in itself, constitute an eligible service. With regard to media-related activities, research, and reports, the applicant must describe the manner in which beneficiaries requested or used the document or information in order to establish the provision of a real services, benefit, assistance, or program activity.</P>
              <P>(viii) De minimis services, benefits, assistance, or other program activities in any state or foreign country will not be accepted as a basis for qualification as a national or international organization. Factors that OPM will consider in determining whether an organization's services, benefits, assistance or other program activities are de minimis include, but are not limited to: nature and extent of the service, benefit, assistance or activity; frequency, continuity, and duration; value of financial assistance awarded to individuals or entities; impact on, or benefit to, beneficiaries; and number of beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(2) Certification that it is an organization recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as tax exempt under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) to which contributions are deductible under 26 U.S.C. 170(c)(2). The CFC will verify that each applicant's name and Employer Identification Number appears in the IRS Business Master File (BMF). If the organization does not appear in the BMF, one of the following must accompany the application:</P>
              <P>(i) An affirmation letter from the IRS, dated on or after January 1 of the campaign year to which the organization is applying, that verifies the organization's current 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.</P>
              <P>(ii) A local affiliate of a national organization that is not separately incorporated must submit a certification from the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or CEO equivalent of the national organization stating that it operates as a bonafide chapter or affiliate in good standing of the national organization and is covered by the national organization's 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) tax exemption. The letter must be signed and dated on or after October 1 of the calendar year preceding the campaign year for which the organization is applying.</P>
              <P>(iii) For central organizations that are churches, the CFC will accept a copy of its most recently published listing (such as a church directory) of section 501(c)(3) organizations that are included in the group exemption held by the central organization. A subordinate may alternatively obtain a letter from the central organization affirming the subordinate's status as an organization exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code that is included in the group exemption held by the central organization.</P>
              <P>(iv) Family Support and Youth Activities (FSYA) located on military installations in the United States and Family Support and Youth Programs (FSYP) located on military installations overseas must provide a copy of certification by the commander of a military installation, as outlined in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, to demonstrate tax-exempt status.</P>
              <P>(3) Family support and youth activities or programs certified by the commander of a military installation as meeting the eligibility criteria contained in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section may appear on the list of local organizations and be supported from CFC funds. Family support and youth activities may participate in the CFC as a member of a federation at the discretion of the certifying commander.</P>
              <P>(4) A family support and youth activity or program must:</P>

              <P>(i) Be a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization that provides family service programs or youth activity programs to personnel in the Command and be a <PRTPAGE P="680"/>Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality that supports the installation MWR/FSYA/FSYP program. The activity must not receive a majority of its financial support from appropriated funds.</P>
              <P>(ii) Have a high degree of integrity and responsibility in the conduct of their affairs. Contributions received must be used effectively for the announced purposes of the organization.</P>
              <P>(iii) Be directed by the base Non-Appropriated Fund Council or an active voluntary board of directors which serves without compensation and holds regular meetings.</P>
              <P>(iv) Conduct its fiscal operations in accordance with a detailed annual budget, prepared and approved at the beginning of the fiscal year. Any significant variations from the approved budget must have prior authorization from the Non-Appropriated Fund Council or the directors. The family support and youth activities must have accounting procedures acceptable to an installation auditor and the inspector general.</P>
              <P>(v) Have a policy and practice of nondiscrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin applicable to persons served by the organization.</P>
              <P>(vi) Prepare an annual report which includes a full description of the organization's activities and accomplishments. These reports must be made available to the public upon request.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Public accountability standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To ensure organizations wishing to solicit donations from Federal employees in the workplace are portraying accurately their programs and benefits, each organization seeking eligibility must meet annually applicable standards and certification requirements. Each organization, other than FSYA or FSYP, wishing to participate must:</P>
              <P>(1) Certify that the organization is a human health and welfare organization providing services, benefits, or assistance to, or conducting activities affecting, human health and welfare. The organization's application must provide documentation describing the health and human welfare benefits provided by the organization within the previous calendar year;</P>
              <P>(2) Subject to the exceptions listed in this section, certify that it accounts for its funds on an accrual basis in accordance with United States or International generally accepted accounting principles and that an audit of its fiscal operations is completed annually by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. A copy of the organization's most recent annual audited financial statements must be included with the application. The statements must include all statements required for voluntary health and welfare organizations by the United States Financial Accounting Standards Board or the International Accounting Standards Board. The audited financial statements must cover the fiscal period ending not more than 18 months prior to the January of the year of the campaign for which the organization is applying. For example, the audited financial statements included in the 2014 application must cover the fiscal period ending on or after June 30, 2012.</P>
              <P>(i) An organization with annual revenue of less than $100,000 reported on its IRS Form 990 or pro forma IRS Form 990 submitted to the CFC is not required to undergo an audit, submit audited financial statements, or to account for its funds on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Rather, the organization must certify that it has controls in place to ensure that funds are properly accounted for and that it can provide accurate and timely financial information to interested parties.</P>
              <P>(ii) An organization with annual revenue of at least $100,000 but less than $250,000 is not required to undergo an audit. The organization must certify that its financial statements are reviewed by an independent certified public accountant on an annual basis or are audited by an independent public accountant on an annual basis. A copy of the reviewed or audited financial statements must be included with the application.</P>

              <P>(3) Certify that it prepares and submits to the IRS a complete copy of the <PRTPAGE P="681"/>organization's IRS Form 990 or that it is not required to prepare and submit an IRS Form 990 to the IRS. Provide a completed copy of the organization's IRS Form 990 submitted to the IRS covering a fiscal period ending not more than 18 months prior to the January of the year of the campaign for which the organization is applying, including signature, and all supplemental schedules, with the application, or if not required to file an IRS Form 990, provide a pro forma IRS Form 990. Pro forma IRS Form 990 instructions will be posted on the OPM Web site and included in the application instructions. IRS Forms 990EZ, 990PF, and comparable forms are not acceptable substitutes. The IRS Form 990 and audited financial statements, if required, must cover the same fiscal period.</P>
              <P>(4) Provide a computation of the organization's percentage of total support and revenue spent on administrative and fundraising. This percentage shall be computed from information on the IRS Form 990 submitted pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Certify that the organization is directed by an active and responsible governing body whose members have no material conflict of interest and, a majority of which serve without compensation.</P>
              <P>(6) Certify that the organization's fundraising practices prohibit the sale or lease of its CFC contributor lists.</P>
              <P>(7) Certify that its publicity and promotional activities are based upon its actual program and operations, are truthful and non-deceptive, and make no exaggerated or misleading claims.</P>
              <P>(8) Certify that contributions are effectively used for the announced purposes of the charitable organization.</P>
              <P>(9) Provide a statement that the certifying official is authorized by the organization to certify and affirm all statements required for inclusion on the Charity List.</P>
              <P>(b) The Director shall review these applications for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with these regulations. Failure to supply any of this information may be judged a failure to comply with the requirements of public accountability, and the charitable organization may be ruled ineligible for inclusion on the Charity List.</P>
              <P>(c) The Director may request such additional information as the Director deems necessary to complete these reviews. An organization that fails to comply with such requests within 10 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request may be judged ineligible.</P>
              <P>(d) The required certifications and documentation must have been completed and submitted prior to the application filing deadline.</P>
              <P>(e) The Director may waive any of these standards and certifications upon a showing of extenuating circumstances.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility decisions and appeals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Organizations applying for participation in the CFC will be notified of the eligibility decision electronically via the email address(es) listed in the charity application.</P>
              <P>(b) Organizations that apply and are denied eligibility for inclusion on the Charity List may appeal the decision by submitting a request for reconsideration. This request must be received within 10 business days from the date the decision to deny eligibility was sent via email and shall be limited to those facts justifying the reversal of the original decision.</P>
              <P>(c) All appeals must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be in writing;</P>
              <P>(2) Be received by the Director within 10 business days of the date the decision to deny the application was sent via email;</P>
              <P>(3) Include a statement explaining the reason(s) why eligibility should be granted; and</P>
              <P>(4) Include a copy of the communication from OPM disapproving the original application and supporting information to justify the reversal of the original decision.</P>
              <P>(d) Applications or appeals of an adverse eligibility determination must be submitted in a timely manner as indicated above.</P>

              <P>(e) Appeals may not be used to supplement applications with documents that did not exist or were not set forth in final form prior to the application deadline. For example, audited financial statements that were not prepared or were in draft form at the time of the deadline cannot be used to document <PRTPAGE P="682"/>eligibility. Similarly, charities that had applied for, but had not obtained, 501(c)(3) status from the IRS by the CFC application deadline are not eligible to participate for that campaign year.</P>
              <P>(f) The Director's decision is final for administrative purposes.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Federation eligibility.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Director may recognize federations that conform to the requirements set by the Director and are eligible to receive designations. In order to determine whether the Director will recognize a federation, the Director may request evidence of corrective action regarding any prior violation of regulation or directive, sanction, or penalty, as appropriate. The Director retains the ultimate authority to decide whether the federation has demonstrated, to the Director's satisfaction, that the federation has taken appropriate corrective action. Failure to demonstrate satisfactory corrective action or to respond to the Director's request for information within 10 business days of the date of the request may result in a determination that the federation will not be included in the Charity List. The Director also reserves the authority to place a moratorium on the recognition of federations from time to time.</P>
              <P>(b) By applying for inclusion in the CFC, federations consent to allow the Director complete access to its and its members' CFC books and records and to respond to requests for information by the Director.</P>
              <P>(c) An organization may apply to the Director for inclusion as a federation to participate in the CFC if the applicant has, as members of the proposed federation, 15 or more charitable organizations, in addition to the federation itself, that meet the eligibility criteria of §§ 950.202 and 950.203. The federation must submit the applications of all its proposed member organizations annually.</P>
              <P>(d) After an organization has been granted federation status, it may certify that its member organizations meet all eligibility criteria of § 950.202 and § 950.203 to be included on the Charity List. Federation status in a prior campaign is not a guarantee of federation status in a subsequent campaign. Failure to meet minimum federation eligibility requirements shall not be deemed to be a withdrawal of federation status subject to a hearing on the record.</P>
              <P>(e) An applicant for federation status must annually certify and/or demonstrate:</P>
              <P>(1) That all member organizations seeking participation in the CFC are qualified for inclusion on the National/International or International or Local part of the Charity List. Applicants must provide a complete list of those member organizations it certified in addition to each organization's complete application.</P>
              <P>(2) That it meets the eligibility requirements and public accountability standards contained in § 950.202 and § 950.203. The federation can demonstrate that it has met the eligibility requirement in § 950.202(a) either through its own services, benefits, assistance or program activities or through its 15 members' activities.</P>
              <P>(i) The federation must complete the certification set forth at § 950.203(a)(2) without regard to the amount of revenue reported on its IRS Form 990 and must provide a copy of its audited financial statements. The audited financial statements provided must verify that the federation is honoring designations made to each member organization by distributing a proportionate share of receipts based on donor designations to each member. The audit requirement is waived for newly created federations operating for less than two years from the date of its IRS tax-exemption letter to the closing date of the CFC application period.</P>
              <P>(ii) The federation must provide a listing of its board of directors, beginning and ending dates of each member's current term of office, and the board's meeting dates and locations for the calendar year prior to the year of the campaign for which the organization is applying.</P>

              <P>(3) That it does not employ in its CFC operations the services of private <PRTPAGE P="683"/>consultants, consulting firms, advertising agencies or similar business organizations to perform its policy-making or decision-making functions in the CFC. It may, however, contract with entities or individuals such as banks, accountants, lawyers, and other vendors of goods and/or services to assist in accomplishing its administrative tasks.</P>
              <P>(f) The Director will notify a federation if it is determined that the federation does not meet the eligibility requirements of this section. A federation may appeal an adverse eligibility decision in accordance with § 950.204.</P>
              <P>(g) The Director may waive any eligibility criteria for federation status if it is determined that such a waiver will be in the best interest of the CFC.</P>
              <P>(h) Two organizations—American Red Cross and United Service Organization—are exempt from the 15- member requirement of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) The Director may elect to review, accept or reject the certifications of the eligibility of the members of federations. If the Director requests information supporting a certification of eligibility, that information shall be furnished promptly. Failure to furnish such information within 10 business days of the receipt of the request constitutes grounds for the denial of national eligibility of that member.</P>
              <P>(c) Each federation, as fiscal agent for its member organizations, must ensure that Federal employee designations are honored in that each member organization receives its proportionate share of receipts based on the results of each individual campaign. The proportionate share of receipts is determined by donor designations to the individual member organization as compared to total campaign designations.</P>
              <P>(d) Federations must disburse CFC funds to each member organization without any further deductions. Membership dues, fees, or other charges to member organizations must be assessed outside of the CFC disbursement process.</P>
              <P>(e) Federations must disburse CFC funds to member organizations on a quarterly basis, at a minimum. The disbursements must be made within the months of June, September, December, and March.</P>
              <P>(f) Disbursements to federation members that include funds from a non- CFC campaign must include a report that clearly identifies the amount of CFC funds.</P>

              <P>(b) During the CFC solicitation period, a participating CFC organization may distribute bona fide educational information describing its services or programs. The organization must be granted permission by the Federal agency installation head, or designee to distribute the material. CFC Coordinators, Keyworkers, other employees or members of the LFCC, are not authorized to grant permission for the distribution of such information. If one organization is granted permission to distribute educational information, then the Federal agency installation head must allow any other requesting CFC organization to distribute educational information.</P>
              <P>(c) Organizations and federations are encouraged to publicize their activities outside Federal facilities and to broadcast messages aimed at Federal employees in an attempt to solicit their contributions through the media and other outlets.</P>

              <P>(d) Agency Heads are further authorized to permit the distribution by organizations of promotional information to Federal personnel in public areas of Federal workplaces in connection with the CFC, provided that the manner of <PRTPAGE P="684"/>distribution accords equal treatment to all charitable organizations furnishing such information for local use, and further provided that no such distribution shall utilize Federal personnel on official duty or interfere with Federal government activities. LFCC members and other campaign personnel are to be particularly aware of the prohibition of assisting any charitable organization or federated group in distributing any type of literature, especially during the campaign. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a LFCC to distribute or arrange for the distribution of any material other than LFCC approved marketing materials.</P>
              <P>(e) The Campaign Charity List and pledge form are the official sources of CFC information and shall be made available in electronic format to all potential contributors. The Charity List and pledging system must inform employees of their right to make a choice to contribute or not to contribute.</P>
              <P>(f) Campaign marketing materials must be comprised of a simple and attractive design that is donor focused and has fundraising appeal and essential working information. The design must focus on the CFC without undue use of charitable organization symbols and logos or other distractions that compete for the donor's attention.</P>
              <P>(g) The following applies specifically to the campaign Charity List:</P>
              <P>(1) OPM will provide the approved Charity List as well as general campaign information. This will include:</P>
              <P>(i) An explanation of the payroll deduction privilege.</P>
              <P>(ii) A description and explanation of other electronic pledging, to include credit cards.</P>
              <P>(iii) A statement that the donor may only designate charitable organizations or federations that are listed in the Charity List and that write-ins are prohibited.</P>
              <P>(iv) Instructions as to how an employee may obtain more specific information about the programs and the finances of the organizations participating in the campaign.</P>
              <P>(v) A description of employees' rights to pursue complaints of undue pressure or coercion in Federal fundraising activities.</P>
              <P>(2) The Charity List will consist of National/International, International, and Local organizations. The order of these organizations will be rotated annually in accordance with OPM instructions. The order of listing of the federated and independent organizations will be determined by a random selection process. The order of organizations within each federation will be determined by the federation. The order within the National/International, International and Local independent groups will be alphabetical. Absent specific instructions from OPM to the contrary, each participating organization and federated group listing must include a description, not to exceed 256 characters, of its services and programs, plus a Web site address and telephone number for the Federal donor to obtain further information about the group's services, benefits, and administrative expenses. Each listing will include the organization's administration and fundraising percentage as calculated pursuant to § 950.203(a)(4).

              <P>(3) Each federation and charitable organization will be assigned a code in a manner determined by the Director. At the beginning of each federated group's listing will be the federation's name, code number, 256 character description, percentage of administrative and fundraising expenses, Web site address and telephone number. Each organization will be identified as National/International, International and Local, respectively.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Listing of national and local affiliate.</E> Listing of a national organization, as well as its local affiliate organization, is permitted. Each national or local organization must individually meet all of the eligibility criteria and submit independent documentation as required in § 950.202 and § 950.203 to be included in the Charity List. However, a local affiliate of a national organization that is not separately incorporated, in lieu of its own 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) tax exemption letter and, to the extent required by § 950.203(a)(2), <PRTPAGE P="685"/>audited financial statements, may submit the national organization's 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) tax exemption letter and audited financial statements, but must provide its own pro forma IRS Form 990, as defined in § 950.203(a)(3), for CFC purposes. The local affiliate must submit a certification from the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or CEO equivalent of the national organization stating that it operates as a bonafide chapter or affiliate in good standing of the national organization and is covered by the national organization's 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) tax exemption, IRS Form 990 and audited financial statements.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Listing local offices.</E> Listing of a local organization, as well as its satellite offices, is permitted, as long as there is no more than one location within a county or parish. Each office must individually meet all of the eligibility criteria and submit independent documentation as required in § 950.202 and § 950.203 to be included in the Charity List. However, a satellite office that is not separately incorporated, in lieu of its own 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) tax exemption letter and, to the extent required by § 950.203(a)(2), audited financial statements, may submit the local organization's 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) tax exemption letter and audited financial statements, but must provide its own pro forma IRS Form 990, as defined in § 950.203(a)(3), for CFC purposes. The satellite office must submit a certification from the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or CEO equivalent of the local organization stating that it operates as a bonafide office in good standing and is covered by the local organization's 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) tax exemption, IRS Form 990 and audited financial statements.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Multiple listing prohibited.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section, once an organization is deemed eligible, it is entitled to only one listing in the Charity List, regardless of the number of federations to which that organization belongs.</P>

              <P>(c) It is the responsibility of the CCA to forward the contributor information for those who have indicated that they wish this information to be released to the recipient organization directly, if the organization is independent, and to the organization's federation if the organization is a member of a federation. The contributor information must be forwarded as soon as practicable after the completion of the campaign, but in no case later than a date to be determined by OPM. The date will be part of the annual timetable issued by the Director under § 950.601(b). The federation is responsible for ensuring the information is released to the appropriate member organization. The CCA may not sell or make any other use of this information. Federations may not retain donor information for their own use unless the donor made a direct designation to the federation itself. This policy also prohibits the sharing of donor information, even free of charge.</P>

CFC special events must be undertaken in the spirit of generating interest in the CFC and be open to all individuals without regard to whether an individual participates in the CFC. If prizes are offered, they must be modest in nature and value. Examples of appropriate prizes may include opportunities for lunch with agency officials, agency parking spaces for a specific time period, and gifts of minimal financial value. Any special CFC event and associated prize or gift must be approved in advance by the Agency's ethics official to ensure that the special event is consistent with Office of Government Ethics regulations and its own regulations and policy. No funds may be raised or collected at these events.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) The Director may impose sanctions or penalties on a federation, charitable organization or Outreach Coordinator for violating these regulations, other applicable provisions of law, or any directive or instruction from the Director. The Director will determine the appropriate sanction and/or penalty, up to and including expulsion from the CFC. In determining the appropriate sanction and/or penalty, the Director will consider previous violations, harm to Federal employee confidence in the CFC, and any other relevant factors. A federation, charitable organization or Outreach Coordinator will be notified in writing of the Director's intent to sanction and/or penalize and will have 10 business days from the date of receipt of the notice to submit a written response. The Director's final decision will be communicated in writing to the federation, charitable organization or marketing organization.</P>
              <P>(2) The Director may withdraw federation status with respect to a National/International, International or Local federation that makes a false certification or fails to comply with any directive of the Director, or to respond in a timely fashion to a request by the Director for information or cooperation, including with respect to an investigation or in the settlement of disbursements. As stated in § 950.301(d), failure to meet minimum federation eligibility requirements shall not be deemed to be a withdrawal of federation status subject to a hearing on the record. Eligibility decisions shall follow the procedures in § 950.301(f). A federation will be notified in writing of the Director's intent to withdraw federation status for a period of up to one campaign and will have 10 business days from the date of receipt of the notice to submit a written response. On receipt of the response, or in the absence of a timely response, the Director or representative shall set a date, time, and place for a hearing. The federation shall be notified at least 10 business days in advance of the hearing. A hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer designated by the Director unless it is waived in writing by the federation. After the hearing is held, or after the Director's receipt of the federation's written waiver of the hearing, the Director shall make a final decision on the record, taking into consideration the recommendation submitted by the hearing officer. The Director's final decision will be communicated in writing to the federation.</P>
              <P>(3) A federation, charitable organization or Outreach Coordinator sanctioned or penalized under any provision of these regulations must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that it has taken corrective action to resolve the reason for sanction and/or penalty and has implemented reasonable and appropriate controls to ensure that the situation will not occur again prior to being allowed to participate in subsequent CFCs.</P>
              <P>(b) At the Director's discretion, CCAs, payroll offices and Federations may be directed to suspend distribution of current and future CFC donations from Federal employees to recipient organizations. CCAs, payroll offices and Federations shall immediately place suspended contributions in an interest bearing account until directed to do otherwise.</P>

Should any change in circumstances pertaining to this certification occur at any time, the organization must notify OPM's Office of CFC immediately. OPM will take such steps as it deems appropriate under the circumstances, including, but not limited to, notifying OFAC and/or other enforcement authorities of such change, suspending disbursement of CFC funds not yet disbursed, retracting (to the extent practicable) CFC funds already disbursed, and suspending or expelling the organization from the CFC.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Payroll allotment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The policies and procedures in this section are authorized for payroll withholding operations in accordance with the Office of Personnel Management Pay Administration regulations in part 550 of this Title.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> Voluntary payroll allotments will be authorized by all Federal departments and agencies for payment of charitable contributions to local CFC organizations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Allotters.</E> The allotment privilege will be made available to Federal personnel as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Employees whose net pay regularly is sufficient to cover the allotment are eligible. An employee serving under an appointment limited to 1 year or less may make an allotment to a CFC when an appropriate official of the employing Federal agency determines that the employee will continue employment for a period sufficient to justify an allotment. This includes military reservists, National Guard, and other part-time and intermittent employees who are regularly employed.</P>
              <P>(2) Members of the Uniformed Services are eligible, excluding those on only short-term assignment (less than 3 months).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Authorization.</E> Allotments will be totally voluntary and will be based upon contributor's individual authorization.</P>

              <P>(1) The CFC Pledge Form, in conformance with § 950.402, is the only form for authorization of the CFC payroll allotment and may be reproduced. The pledge forms and official Charity <PRTPAGE P="688"/>List will be made available to employees electronically when charitable contributions are solicited.</P>
              <P>(2) The electronic pledge is transmitted to the contributor's servicing payroll office in real time via the centralized pledge system.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Duration.</E> Authorization of allotments will be in the form of a term allotment. Term authorizations will be in effect for 1 full year—26, 24, or 12 pay periods depending on the allotter's pay schedule—starting with the first pay period after January 15 and ending with the last pay period that includes January 15 of the following year. Three months of employment is considered the minimum amount of time that is reasonable for establishing an allotment.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Amount.</E> Allotters will make a single allotment that is apportioned into equal amounts for deductions each pay period during the year.</P>
              <P>(1) The minimum amount of the allotment will not be less than $1 per payday per charitable organization, with no restriction on the size of the increment above that minimum.</P>
              <P>(2) No change of amount will be authorized for term allotments.</P>
              <P>(3) No deduction will be made for any period in which the allotter's net pay, after all legal and previously authorized deductions, is insufficient to cover the CFC allotment. No adjustment will be made in subsequent periods to make up for missed deductions.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Discontinuance.</E> Term allotments will be discontinued automatically on expiration of the 1 year withholding period, or on the death, retirement, or separation of the allotter from the Federal service, whichever is earlier.</P>
              <P>(1) An allotter may revoke a term authorization at any time by requesting it in writing from the payroll office. Discontinuance will be effective the first pay period beginning after receipt of the written revocation in the payroll office.</P>
              <P>(2) A discontinued allotment will not be reinstated.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Transfer.</E> When an allotter moves to another organizational unit, whether in the same office or a different Department or agency, his or her allotment authorization must be transferred to the new payroll office.</P>

              <P>(1) The EFT will be accompanied by an electronic transmittal identifying the Federal agency, the dates of the pay period, the pay period number, employee names and deduction amounts per individual employee.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Accounting.</E> (1) OPM may require Federal payroll offices to oversee the establishment of individual allotment accounts, the deductions each pay period, and the reconciliation of employee accounts in accordance with agency and Federal Accounting Standards and Office of Management and Budget requirements. OPM may further require that Federal payroll offices ensure the accuracy of remittances, as supported by current allotment authorizations, and internal accounting and auditing requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) The CCA shall notify the federations, national and international organizations, and local organizations as soon as practicable after the completion of the campaign, but in no case later than a date to be determined by OPM, of the amounts, if any, designated to them and their member agencies. The date will be part of the annual timetable issued by the Director under § 950.601(b). The CCA is also responsible for distributing credit card, debit card, e-check, check and money order receipts and payroll deductions transmitted by the payroll offices. It is responsible for the accuracy of disbursements it transmits to recipients. The CCA will distribute all CFC receipts beginning April 1, and monthly thereafter. It shall remit the contributions to each organization or to the federation, if any, of which the organization is a member. At the close of each disbursement period, the CFC account shall have a balance of zero, based on the last reconciled bank statement.</P>
