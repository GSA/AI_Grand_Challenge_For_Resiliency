      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.

        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

              (b) A petition to consolidate shall be filed not later than the first prehearing conference in the proceeding with which consolidation is requested, and shall relate only to then pending applications. If made at such conference, the petition may be oral. A petition which is not timely filed shall be dismissed unless the petitioner shall clearly show good cause for the failure to file said petition on time.

              Petition for leave to intervene.

              A petition for leave to intervene may be filed in any proceeding before the Administration. The petition will be granted by the presiding officer if the proposed intervenor establishes that it has a substantial interest in the proceeding and will not unduly broaden the issues therein or unduly delay the proceeding. All such petitions shall be filed prior to the opening of the prehearing conference, or if none is held, before the commencement of hearing, unless petitioner shows good cause for allowing the petition at a later time. Intervention petitions shall be served in the same manner as other petitions, and shall be subject to answer. Intervention petitions will be granted where necessary to protect substantial interests of the petitioner and where intervention will not materially broaden the issues. A person granted permission to intervene becomes a party to the proceeding.

If made before or after the hearing, such motions shall be in writing. If made at the hearing, they may be stated orally: Provided, however, That the presiding officer may require that such motion be reduced to writing and filed and served in the same manner as a formal motion.

Oral argument upon a written motion in which an answer has been filed may be granted within the discretion of the Administration or the presiding officer, as the case may be. A repetitious motion will not be entertained.

An answer to a written application, petition, or motion shall be in writing and shall be filed within ten days after service of the pleading which it answers. Any new matter raised in an answer shall be deemed to be controverted. A response to an answer is called a reply. A short reply restricted to such new matters may be filed within five days of service of the answer.

              Presiding officer.
              An Administrative Law Judge in the Department of Transportation Office of Hearings will be designated by the Department's Chief Administrative Law Judge to preside at hearings required by statute, or directed to be held under the Administration's discretionary authority in hearings not required by statute, in rotation so far as practicable, unless the Administration shall designate one or more of its officials to serve as presiding officer(s) in hearings required by statute, or member(s) of the staff in proceedings not required by statute.

              § 201.89
              Disqualification of presiding officer.
              Any presiding officer may at any time withdraw if he deems himself disqualified, in which case another presiding officer will be designated.

              Filing of motions, answers.
              Any party or (if a petition to intervene shall have been filed but not have been acted upon) any prospective party may at or before the first prehearing conference in any proceeding, or at such later time as might be allowed by the presiding officer, move with supporting affidavits for a summary disposition in his favor of all or any part of the proceeding. Any adverse party may within 20 days serve opposing affidavits or may countermove for summary disposition. Oral argument thereon may be granted in the discretion of the presiding officer.
            
            
              § 201.92
              Ruling on motion.
              The presiding officer may grant such motion if the application, motion, or other pleadings, affidavits or depositions, if any, and matters of official notice show that there is no genuine issue as to any material facts, that there is no necessity that further facts be developed in the record, and that such party is entitled to a decision as a matter of law.
            
            
              § 201.93
              Review of ruling, appeal.
              The order of the presiding officer denying a motion for summary disposition shall be subject to interlocutory appeal under the provisions of § 201.123. An order granting a motion for summary disposition is automatically reviewable by the Administration in accordance with the provisions of § 201.133 and shall not be final until acted upon by the Administration.
            
          
          
            Subpart J—Prehearing Conference; Settlements; Procedural Agreements (Rule 10)
            
              § 201.101
              Prehearing conference.

              Prior to any hearing a prehearing conference may be held before the presiding officer. Written notice of a prehearing conference shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Administration or the Chief Hearing Examiner to all parties of record including persons whose petitions for leave to intervene in the proceeding have not theretofore been granted, and where practicable, by general release to the public press.
              (a) At the prehearing conference the following matters, among others, shall be considered: (1) Petitions for leave to intervene; (2) motions for consolidation or severance of dockets for joint or separate hearing to the extent that the Administration has not theretofore taken specific action; (3) simplification and delineation of the issues to be heard; (4) designation of matters in respect of which official notice may be taken; (5) requests for discovery and production of evidence considered to be generally relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding; (6) stipulations; (7) limitation of number of witnesses, particularly the avoidance of duplicate expert witnesses; (8) procedure applicable to the proceeding; (9) offers of settlement, as hereinafter to be more particularly discussed in § 201.103; and (10) scheduling of the dates for exchange of exhibits, written testimony both affirmative and rebuttal and establishing the date, time and place for hearing.
              (b) If deemed necessary or appropriate, the presiding officer may also, on his own motion, or on motion of Public Counsel direct any party to a proceeding to prepare and submit exhibits setting forth studies, forecasts, or estimates on matters relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding to be sponsored by witnesses available for cross-examination thereon.
            
            
              § 201.102
              Prehearing rulings.
              The presiding officer will, where practicable, issue prehearing rulings, acting on petitions for leave to intervene, delineating the issues, summarizing the rulings made at the conference, specifying a schedule for the exchange of exhibits and written testimony, the date, time and place of hearing and specifying a time for the filing of exceptions to the rulings. The prehearing rulings shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding and any persons who participated in the conference. Exceptions to the prehearing rulings may be filed by any such party or person within the time specified therein. The presiding officer may serve amended rulings in the light of the exceptions presented. Such rulings and amendments, if any, shall constitute the official account of the conference and shall control the subsequent course of the proceeding, but they may be reconsidered and modified at any time to protect the public interest or to prevent injustice.
            
            
              § 201.103
              Opportunity for agreement of parties and settlement of case.
              Where time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest permit, all interested parties shall have the opportunity for submission to and consideration by the presiding officer of offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment together with facts and/or arguments relevant to such offers or proposals without prejudice to the rights of the parties. The presiding officer need not be present at any negotiations of such nature. The presiding officer shall issue an initial or recommended decision thereon recommending approval or disapproval of such offer of settlement or proposal of adjustment to the Administration for final action thereon. No agreement, offer, or proposal shall be admissible in evidence over the objection of any party in any hearing on the matter. When any settlement does not dispose of the whole proceeding, the remaining issues shall be determined in accordance with sections 7 and 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act.
            
          
          
            Subpart K—Discovery and Depositions (Rule 11)
            
              § 201.109
              Discovery and production of documents.

              Upon request of any party showing good cause therefor, at the prehearing conference or otherwise upon notice to all other parties, the Administration or presiding officer may direct any party to produce and permit the inspection and copying or photographing, by or on behalf of the moving party, of any designated documents, papers, books, accounts, letters, photographs, objects, or tangible things, not privileged which constitute or contain evidence relating to any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending proceeding, and which are in his possession, custody or control. The order shall specify the time, place, and manner of making the inspection and taking the copies and photographs and may prescribe such terms and conditions as are just. In lieu of such inspections the material may be produced in exhibit form and served upon all parties to a formal proceeding. Such exhibits may also, upon request of any party, be offered in evidence at a hearing.
            
            
              § 201.110
              Depositions: request for orders to take; time of filing.
              The Administration or presiding officer may, upon proper request of a party to a proceeding or under circumstances deemed proper, issue an order to take a deposition regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the proceedings. A motion to take a deposition shall be filed not less than fifteen (15) days before the proposed date for taking the deposition, unless a shorter period is fixed under § 201.54, and shall set forth the reason for the deposition, the place and time of taking, the officer before whom it is to be taken, the name and address of each witness to be examined, if known, and, if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify him or the particular class or group to which he belongs, and whether the deposition is to be based upon written interrogatories or upon oral examination. If the deposition is to be based upon oral examination, the motion shall contain a statement of the matters concerning which each witness will testify. If the deposition is to be based on written interrogatories, the motion shall be accompanied by the interrogatories to be propounded, serially numbered. Copies of all motions to take depositions, and accompanying interrogatories, if any, shall conform to the requirements of subpart D of this part. Objection to the taking of such depositions may be made in an answer to such motion. Without prejudice to objection, the answer may also state objection to any individual interrogatory, and if the deposition is permitted, the presiding officer will rule upon such objections to interrogatories. A party served with an order to take a deposition on written interrogatories shall have ten (10) days after date of service of such order unless a shorter period is fixed under § 201.54, within which to file and serve written cross interrogatories, which shall be served pursuant to subpart D of this part. Answers to applications for cross interrogatories may be filed in accordance with § 201.80. Upon the issuance of an order by the Administration or the presiding officer for the taking of a deposition, the Docket Clerk shall mail a copy thereof to all parties, including the party who requested the deposition. An application to take a deposition in a foreign country will be entertained when necessary or convenient, and authority to take such deposition will be granted upon such notice and other terms and directions as are lawful and appropriate.
            
            
              § 201.111
              Contents of order.
              The order issued authorizing the taking of a deposition will state the name and address of each witness or a general description sufficient to identify him or the particular class or group to which he belongs, the matters concerning which the witness may be questioned, the place where, the time when, and the officer before whom the deposition is to be taken, any or all of which may or may not be the same as set forth in the motion filed. If the deposition is to be taken upon written interrogatories, a list of the interrogatories will accompany the order.
            
            
              § 201.112
              Record of examination; oath; objections.

              The officer before whom the deposition is to be taken shall put the witness under oath and shall personally, or by someone acting under his direction and in his presence, record the testimony of the witness. The testimony shall be taken stenographically, shall be translated to English, if necessary, and shall be transcribed unless the parties agree otherwise. All objections made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer taking the deposition, or to the manner of taking it, or to the evidence presented, or to the conduct of any party, and any other objections to the proceedings, shall be noted by the officer upon the deposition. Any party served with a notice to take an oral deposition may cross-examine a witness whose testimony is taken under such deposition. In lieu of cross-examination, parties served with notice of taking a deposition may transmit written interrogatories or cross-interrogatories to the officer taking the deposition, who shall propound them to the witness and record the answers verbatim together with any objections interposed thereto by adverse parties.
            
            
              § 201.113
              Submission to witness, changes, signing.
              When the testimony is fully transcribed the deposition of each witness shall be submitted to him for examination and shall be read to or by him. Any changes in form or substance which the witness desires to make shall be entered upon the deposition by the officer with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for making them. The deposition shall then be signed by the witness, unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the witness is ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign. If the deposition is not signed by the witness, the officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver or of the illness or absence of the witness or the fact of the refusal to sign, together with the reason, if any, given therefor; and the deposition may then be used as fully as though signed, unless upon objection the presiding officer holds that the reasons given for the refusal to sign require rejection of the deposition in whole or in part.
            
            
              § 201.114
              Certification and filing by officer; copies.
              The officer taking the deposition shall certify on the deposition that the witness was duly sworn by him and that the deposition is a true record of the testimony given by the witness, and that said officer is not of counsel or attorney to either of the parties and is not directly or indirectly interested in the outcome of the proceeding or investigation. He shall then securely seal the deposition in an envelope endorsed with the title of the proceeding and marked “Deposition of (here insert name of witness)”, and shall promptly send the original and two copies thereof, together with the original and two copies of all exhibits, by registered mail to the Administration. Parties shall make their own arrangements with the officer taking the deposition for copies of the testimony and exhibits.
            
            
              § 201.115
              Waiver of objections and admissibility.
              Objections to the form of question and answer shall be made before the officer taking the deposition by parties or representatives present, and if not so made, shall be deemed waived. Depositions shall, when offered at the hearing, be subject to proper legal objections.
            
            
              § 201.116
              Time of filing.

              § 201.121
              Application for subpoena ad testificandum.

              An application for a subpoena requiring attendance of a witness at a hearing may be made without notice by any party to the presiding officer, or, in the event that a presiding officer has not been assigned to a proceeding or the presiding officer is not available, to the Chief Hearing Examiner, for action by him or by a member of the Administration. A subpoena for the attendance of a witness shall be issued on oral application at any time and shall be issued upon request of any interested party upon tender of an original and two copies of such subpoena. A record of the issuance of such a subpoena shall be entered in the docket.
            
            
              § 201.122
              Application for subpoena duces tecum.
              An application for a subpoena duces tecum for documentary or tangible evidence shall be in duplicate except that for good cause shown it may be made during the course of a hearing on the record to the presiding officer. Such application need not be served upon all parties. All such applications, whether written or oral, shall contain a statement or showing of general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought and shall be accompanied by an original and two copies of the subpoena sought which shall describe the documentary or tangible evidence to be subpoenaed with as much particularity as is feasible.
            
            
              § 201.123
              Standards for issuance of subpoena duces tecum.
              The officer considering any application for a subpoena duces tecum shall issue the subpoena requested if he is satisfied the application complies with this section and the request is not unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope or unduly burdensome. No attempt shall be made to determine the admissibility of evidence in passing upon an application for a subpoena duces tecum and no detailed or burdensome showing shall be required as a condition to the issuance of any subpoena.
            
            
              § 201.124
              Service and quashing of subpoenas.
              Subpoenas issued under this section may be served upon the person to whom directed in accordance with subpart D of this part. Any person upon whom a subpoena is served may within seven (7) days after service or at any time prior to the return date thereof, whichever is earlier, file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena with the officer who issued the subpoena for action by him, and serve a copy of such motion to quash upon the party requesting the subpoena. If the person to whom the motion to modify or quash the subpoena has been addressed or directed has not acted upon such a motion by the return date, such date shall be stayed pending his final action thereon. The Administration may at any time review, upon its own initiative, the ruling of the officer denying a motion to quash a subpoena. In such cases, the Administration may at any time order that the return date of a subpoena which it has elected to review be stayed pending Administration action thereon.
            
            
              § 201.125

              § 201.126
              Service of subpoenas.
              If service of subpoena is made by a United States marshal or his deputy, such service shall be evidenced by his return thereon. If made by any other person, such person shall make affidavit thereto, describing the manner in which service is made, and return such affidavit on or with the original subpoena. In case of failure to make service, the reasons for the failure shall be stated on the original subpoena. In making service the original subpoena shall be exhibited to the person served, shall be read to him if he is unable to read, and a copy thereof shall be left with him. The original subpoena, bearing or accompanied by required return, affidavit, or statement, shall be returned without delay to the Administration, or if so directed on the subpoena, to the presiding officer before whom the person named in the subpoena is required to appear.

            Subpart M—Hearing Procedures (Rule 13)
            
              § 201.131
              Presentation of evidence.
              (a) Testimony. Where appropriate, the Presiding officer may direct that the testimony of witnesses be prepared in written exhibit form and shall be served at designated dates in advance of the hearing. Evidence as to events occurring after the exhibit-exchange dates shall be presented by a revision of exhibits. Witnesses sponsoring exhibits shall be made available for cross-examination. However, unless authorized by the presiding officer, witnesses will not be permitted to read prepared testimony into the record. The evidentiary record shall be limited to factual and expert opinion testimony. Argument will not be received in evidence but rather should be presented in opening and/or closing statements of counsel and in briefs to the presiding officer subsequently filed.
              (b) Exhibits. All exhibits and responses to requests for evidence shall be numbered consecutively by the party submitting same and appropriately indexed as to number and title and shall be exchanged on dates prior to the hearing prescribed in the prehearing rulings. Written testimony should be identified alphabetically. Two copies shall be sent to each party and two to the presiding officer. No response to a request for evidence will be received into the record unless offered and received as an exhibit at the hearing. The exhibits, other than the written testimony, shall include appropriate footnotes or narrative material explaining the source of the information used and the methods employed in statistical compilations and estimates and shall contain a short commentary explaining the conclusions which the offeror draws from the data. Rebuttal exhibits should refer specifically to the exhibits being rebutted. Where one part of a multipage exhibit is based upon another part, appropriate cross-reference should be made. The principal title of each exhibit should state precisely what it contains and may also contain a statement of the purpose for which the exhibit is offered. However, such explanatory statement, if phrased in an argumentative fashion, will not be considered as a part of the evidentiary record. Additional exhibits pertinent to the issues may be submitted in a proceeding with the approval of the presiding officer.
              (c) Cooperation on basic data. Parties having like interests are specifically encouraged to cooperate with each other in joint presentations particularly in such items as basic passenger, cargo, and scheduling data compiled from official or semiofficial sources, and any other evidence susceptible to joint presentation. Duplicate presentation of the same evidence should be avoided wherever possible.
              (d) Authenticity. The authenticity of all documents submitted as proposed exhibits in advance of the hearing shall be deemed admitted unless written objection thereto is filed prior to the hearing, except that a party will be permitted to challenge such authenticity at a later time upon a clear showing of good cause for failure to have filed such written objection.
              (e) Statement of position and trial briefs. A written statement of position should be exchanged by all counsel with copies to all other parties prior to the beginning of the hearing: Provided, however, That Public Counsel or counsel for a public body which has intervened as its interests may appear, may offer his statement of position at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, unless such is impracticable. This statement should include a showing of the theory of the case of the party submitting the statement and will not be subject to cross-examination. Trial briefs are acceptable but will not be required.
            
            
              § 201.132
              Conduct of the hearing.
              (a) Order of presentation. Normally the order of presentation at the hearing will be alphabetical in each of the following categories:
              (1) MarAd statistical material.
              (2) Shipper interests, United States and foreign government departments.
              (3) Applicants.
              (4) Intervenors.
              (5) Public counsel.

              Normally, rebuttal should be presented without any adjournment in the proceedings.
              
              (b) Burden of proof. The burden of proof shall be (1) upon an applicant for any form of government aid or grant; and (2) upon a proponent for the issuance of any rule or order within the jurisdiction of the Administration. The burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence in proceedings involving matters under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section shall fall upon opposing intervenors. Whenever an intervenor is permitted by the presiding officer to raise or advance a new issue in the proceeding, the burden of proof as to such issue shall fall upon such intervenor. If the burden of proof is met as to such new issue, the other parties shall have the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence in such regard.
              (c) Requirement for submission of corrected copies of exhibits. Each party shall present three fully corrected copies of its exhibits to be offered in evidence, one for the docket and two for the presiding officer.
              (d) Offer of exhibits in evidence. The exhibits and written testimony sponsored by each witness shall be offered in evidence at the close of his direct examination to the extent practicable. After ruling upon motions to strike they shall be received in evidence subject to cross-examination. The presiding officer, in his discretion, may defer such ruling until after completion of cross-examination.
              (e)(1) Cross-examination. Cross-examination shall be limited to the scope of the direct examination and, except for Public Counsel and counsel for public bodies which have intervened as their interests may appear, to witnesses whose testimony is adverse to the party desiring to cross-examine—this being intended specifically to prohibit so-called “friendly cross-examination”. Cross-examination, which is not necessary to test the truth and completeness of the direct testimony and exhibits, will not be permitted.
              (2) Re-cross-examination. Second rounds of cross-examination normally will not be permitted unless it is necessary to cover new matters raised by a subsequent examination. Cross-examination of any particular witness shall be limited to one attorney for each party and shall not include subjects which are not germane to the interest represented by the cross-examiner.
              (f) Oral motions. Oral presentation on any motion or objection shall be limited to the party or parties making the motion or objection and the party or parties against which the motion or objection is directed and Public Counsel. Such presentation shall also be limited to one attorney for each party.
              (g) Official notice; public document items. Whenever there is offered (in whole or in part) a public document, such as an official report, decision, opinion, or published scientific or economic statistical data issued by any of the executive departments (or their subdivisions), legislative agencies or committees, or administrative agencies of the Federal Government (including Government-owned corporations), or a similar document issued by a State or its agencies, and such document (or part thereof) has been shown by the offerer to be reasonably available to the public, such document need not be produced or marked for identification, but may be offered for official notice as a public document item by specifying the document or relevant part thereof.
              (h) Oral argument at hearings. A request for oral argument at the close of testimony will be granted or denied by the presiding officer in his discretion.
            
            
              § 201.133
              Appeal from ruling of presiding officer.
              Rulings of presiding officers may not be appealed prior to, or during the course of, the hearing except where the presiding officer has granted a Motion for Summary Disposition under subpart I of this part, or in extraordinary circumstances where prompt decision by the Administration is necessary to prevent unusual delay, expense, or detriment to the public interest, in which instances the matter shall be referred forthwith by the presiding officer to the Administration. Any such appeal shall be filed within fifteen (15) days from the date of the ruling by the presiding officer.
            
            
              § 201.134
              Separation of functions.

              The separation of functions as required by section 5(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act shall be observed in adversary proceedings involving controverted factual issues arising under the regulations in this part.
            
          
          
            Subpart N—Evidence (Rule 14)
            
              § 201.136
              Evidence admissible.
              In any proceeding under the regulations in this part all evidence which is relevant, material, reliable and probative, and not unduly repetitious or cumulative shall be admissible. Irrelevant and immaterial or unduly repetitious or cumulative evidence shall be excluded.
            
            
              § 201.137
              Rights of parties as to presentation of evidence.
              Every party shall have the right to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
            
            
              § 201.138
              Unsponsored written material.
              (a) Material that may be deemed evidence. Where a formal hearing is held, a party shall be afforded an opportunity to participate through submission of relevant, material, reliable and probative written evidence including official notice matters covered in § 201.132(g): Provided, That such evidence submitted by persons not present at the hearing will not be made a part of the record if opposed to by any party for good cause shown.
              (b) Material that may not be deemed evidence. Letters expressing views or urging action and other unsponsored written material in respect of matters embraced in, or related to, a formal hearing will be placed in the correspondence section of the docket of the proceeding. These data are not to be deemed part of the evidence or part of the record in the material unless sponsored at the public hearing by an authenticating and supporting witness.
            
            
              § 201.139
              Documents containing matter both material and not material.
              Where written matter offered in evidence is embraced in a document containing other matter which is not intended to be offered in evidence, the party offering shall present the original document to all parties at the hearing for their inspection, and shall offer a true copy of the matter which is to be introduced unless the presiding officer determines that the matter is short enough to be read into the record. Opposing parties shall be afforded an opportunity to introduce in evidence, or by stipulations other portions of the original document which are material and relevant.
            
            
              § 201.140
              Records in other proceedings.
              When any portion of the record before the Administration in any proceeding other than the one being heard is offered in evidence, a true copy of such portion shall be presented for the record in the form of an exhibit unless the parties represented at the hearing stipulate upon the record that such portion may be incorporated by reference.
            
            
              § 201.141
              Stipulations.
              The parties may, by stipulation in writing filed at the prehearing conference, or by written or oral stipulation presented at the hearing or by written stipulation subsequent to the hearing, agree upon any facts involved in the proceeding and include them in the record with the consent of the presiding officer. Proposed written stipulations shall be subscribed by the sponsors and served upon all parties of record. Only upon acceptance by all parties to the proceeding may a stipulation be noted for the record or received as evidence.
            
            
              § 201.142
              Further evidence required by presiding officer during hearing.

              At any time during the hearing the presiding officer may call for the production of further relevant and material evidence, reports, studies, and analyses upon any issue, and require such evidence, where available, to be presented by the party or parties concerned, either at the hearing or adjournment thereof in accordance with § 201.132(b). Such material shall be received subject to appropriate motions, cross-examination and/or rebuttal. If a witness refuses to testify or produce the evidence as requested, the presiding officer shall report such refusal to the Administration forthwith.
            
            
              § 201.143
              Exceptions to rulings of presiding officer unnecessary.
              Formal exceptions to rulings of the presiding officer are unnecessary. It is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling of the presiding officer is made or sought, makes known the action which he desires the presiding officer to take or his objection to an action taken, and his grounds therefor.
            
            
              § 201.144
              Offer of proof.
              An offer of proof made in connection with an objection taken to any ruling of the presiding officer rejecting or excluding proffered oral testimony shall consist of a statement of the substance of the evidence which counsel contends would be adduced by such testimony; and, if the excluded evidence consists of evidence in documentary or written form or of reference to documents or records, a copy of such evidence shall be marked for identification and shall accompany the record as the offer of proof.
            
          
          
            Subpart O—The Record: Contents; Development; Perfection; Confidential Treatment (Rule 15)
            
              § 201.146
              Receipt of documents after hearing.
              Documents to be submitted for the record after the close of the hearing will not be received in evidence except upon ruling of the presiding officer. Such documents when submitted shall be accompanied by proof that copies have been served upon all parties, who shall have an opportunity to comment thereon; and shall be received not later than ten (10) days after the close of the hearing except for good cause shown, and not less than ten (10) days prior to the date set for filing briefs. Exhibit numbers should be assigned by counsel or the party. In computing the time within which to file such documents or other writings the five (5) additional days provided in § 201.54 shall not apply. Documents which are submitted but do not comply with the provisions of this rule will be filed in the correspondence section of the docket.
            
            
              § 201.147
              Official transcript.
              The Administration will designate the official reporter for all hearings. The official transcript of testimony taken, together with any exhibits and any briefs or memoranda of law filed therewith shall be filed with the Administration. Transcripts of testimony will be available in any proceeding under the regulations in this section, and will be supplied by the official reporter to the parties and to the public except when required for good cause to be held confidential, at rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by the contract between the Administration and the reporter.
            
            
              § 201.148
              Corrections of transcript.
              Motions made at the hearing to correct the record will be acted upon by the presiding officer. Motions made after the hearing to correct the record as to matters of substance rather than form, shall be filed with the presiding officer within ten (10) days after receipt of the transcript, unless otherwise directed by the presiding officer, and shall be served on all parties. Such motions may be in the form of a letter and shall certify the date when the transcript was received. If no objections are received within ten (10) days after date of service, the transcript will, upon approval of the presiding officer, be changed to reflect such corrections. If objections are received, the motion will be acted upon with due consideration of the stenographic record of the hearing.
            
            
              § 201.149
              Copies of data or evidence.
              Every person compelled to submit data or evidence shall be entitled to retain or procure a copy of transcript thereof on payment of proper costs.
            
            
              § 201.150
              Record for decision.

              The transcript of testimony and exhibits, together with all papers and requests (except the correspondence section of the docket), including rulings and any recommended or initial decisions filed in the proceeding shall constitute the exclusive record for decision. Final decisions will be predicated on the same record, including the initial decision of the presiding officer.
            
            
              § 201.151
              Objections to public disclosure of information.
              Upon objection to public disclosure of any information sought to be elicited during a hearing, and a showing of cause satisfactory to the presiding officer, the witness shall disclose such information only in the presence of the presiding officer, official reporter and such attorneys or representatives of each party with demonstrated interests, as the presiding officer shall determine and after all present have been sworn to secrecy. The transcript of testimony shall be held confidential. Within five (5) days after such testimony is given, or document received, the objecting party shall file with the presiding officer a verified written motion to withhold such information from public disclosure, setting forth sufficient identification of same and the basis upon which public disclosure should not be made. Copies of said transcript and motion need not be served upon any other parties than those sworn to secrecy unless so ordered by the presiding officer.

              Briefs; request for findings.
              The time for filing briefs to the presiding officer, and extensions thereof, shall be fixed by him. The period of time allowed shall be the same for all parties unless the presiding officer, for good cause shown, directs otherwise. Normally there shall be an opening brief by the moving parties, an answering brief by the proponents of a contrary conclusion and a short reply by the moving parties. Briefs and statements of position as authorized, shall be served upon all parties pursuant to subpart D of this part. Briefs shall include a summary of evidence, together with references to exhibit numbers and pages of the transcript, and memoranda of law with appropriate citations of the authorities relied upon. They shall contain proposed findings of fact and conclusions in serially numbered paragraphs.
            
            
              § 201.156
              Requests for extension of time for filing briefs.
              Requests for extension of time within which to file briefs shall conform to the requirements of § 201.53. Except for good cause shown, such requests shall be filed and served not later than five (5) days before the expiration of the time fixed for the filing of briefs.
            
            
              § 201.157
              Reopening of a case by presiding officer prior to decision.
              At any time prior to the filing of his initial or recommended decision, the presiding officer, either upon petition or upon his own initiative may, for good cause shown and upon reasonable notice, reopen the case for the receipt of further evidence.
            
            
              § 201.158
              Decisions, authority to make and kinds.
              To the presiding officer is delegated the authority to render initial or recommended decisions in all proceedings before him, including motions, petitions and other pleadings. Tentative or final decisions will be rendered by the Administration. The same officers who preside at the reception of evidence pursuant to section 7 of the Administrative Procedure Act shall render the initial or recommended decisions except where such officers become unavailable to the Administration, in which case another Presiding Officer will be designated to make such decision or certify the record to the Administration. Where the Administration requires the entire record in the case to be certified to it for initial decision, the Presiding Officer shall first recommend a decision, except that in rule making:
              (a) In lieu thereof the Administration may issue a tentative decision or any of its responsible officers may recommend a decision or (b) any such procedure may be omitted in any case in which the Administration finds upon the record that due and timely execution of its functions in the public interest imperatively and unavoidably so requires.
            
            
              § 201.159
              Decisions; contents and service.

              All initial, recommended, tentative, and final decisions, whether rendered orally or in writing shall include a statement of findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or bases therefor, upon the material issues presented, as well as a statement of the appropriate rule, order, sanction, relief to be imposed, or the denial thereof. A copy of each decision when issued or when transcribed if orally rendered (and all orally presented decisions shall be stenographically recorded) shall be served on the parties to the proceeding, and furnished to interested persons upon request.
            
            
              § 201.160
              Decision based on official notice.

              Official notice may be taken of such matters as might be judicially noticed by the courts, or of technical or scientific facts within the general or specialized knowledge of the Administration as an expert body or of a document required to be filed with or published by a duly constituted governmental body: Provided, That where a decision or part thereof rests on the official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence of the record, the fact of official notice shall be so stated in the decision, and any party, on timely request, shall be afforded an opportunity to show the contrary.
            
            
              § 201.161
              Exceptions to, and review by the Administration of initial or recommended decisions.
              Within twenty (20) days after the service date of the initial or recommended decision, whether oral or in writing, unless a shorter period is fixed under § 201.54, any party may file exceptions to any conclusions, findings, or statements contained in such decision, and a brief in support of such exceptions. Such exceptions and brief shall constitute one document, shall indicate with particularity alleged errors, shall indicate pages of transcript and exhibit numbers when referring to the record, and shall be served on all parties pursuant to subpart D of this part. Whenever the presiding officer renders an initial decision, in the absence of the filing of exceptions thereto, or notice of review thereof by the Administration, such decision, shall upon the issuance of an appropriate order by the Administration, become the decision of the Administration. Upon the filing of exceptions to, or notice of review of, an initial or recommended decision, such decision shall become inoperative until the Administration determines the matter. Where exceptions are filed to, or the Administration reviews, an initial or recommended decision, the Administration, except as it may limit the issues upon notice or by rule, will have all the powers which it would have in making the initial decision. Whenever the Administration shall determine to review an initial or recommended decision on its own initiative, notice of such intention shall be served upon the parties within thirty (30) days after the date when the initial or recommended decision is orally rendered and, if in writing, served.
            
            
              § 201.162
              Replies to exceptions.
              Any party may file and serve a reply to exceptions within twenty (20) days after date of service thereof, unless a shorter period is fixed pursuant to § 201.54. Such reply shall indicate pages of the transcript and exhibit numbers when referring to the record.
            
            
              § 201.163
              Request for extension of time for filing exceptions and replies thereto.
              Requests for extension of time within which to file exceptions, and briefs in support thereof, or replies to exceptions shall conform to the applicable provisions of subpart E of this part. Except for good cause shown, such requests shall be filed and served not later than five (5) days before the expiration of the time fixed for the filing of such documents.
            
            
              § 201.164
              Certification of record by presiding officer.
              The presiding officer shall certify and transmit the entire record to the Administration when: (a) Exceptions are filed or the time therefor has expired, (b) notice is given by the Administration that the initial or recommended decision will be reviewed on its own initiative, or (c) the Administration requires the case to be certified to it for initial decision.
            
          
          
            
            Subpart Q—Oral Argument; Submittal for Final Decision (Rule 17)
            
              § 201.166
              Oral argument.
              If oral argument before the Administration is desired on exceptions or replies to exceptions to an initial, recommended, or tentative decision, or on a motion, petition, or application, a request therefor shall be made in writing properly addressed to the Administration. Any party may make such request irrespective of his filing exceptions or replies. If a brief on exceptions or replies thereto are filed, the request for oral argument shall be incorporated therein. Requests for oral argument on any motion, petition, or application shall be made in the motion, petition, or application or in the reply thereto. Requests for oral argument will be granted or denied in the discretion of the Administration, and, if granted, the notice of oral argument will set forth the order of presentation and the amount of time to be allotted. Those who appear before the Administration for oral argument should confine their argument to points of controlling importance and shall limit their argument to points upon which exceptions have been filed. Where the facts of a case are adequately and accurately dealt with in the initial, recommended, or tentative decision, parties should, as far as possible, address themselves in argument to the conclusions. Effort should be made by parties taking the same position to agree in advance of the argument upon those who are to present their side of the case. The names of persons who will argue and the amount of time requested by each should be received by the Administration not later than ten (10) days before the date set for the argument. Ordinarily, consolidation of appearances at oral argument will permit the parties' interests to be presented more effectively in the time allotted.
            
            
              § 201.167
              Submission to Administration for final decision.
              A proceeding will be deemed submitted to the Administration for its determination as follows: (a) If oral argument is had, on the date of completion thereof, or if memoranda on points of law are permitted to be filed after argument, the last date of such filing; (b) if oral argument is not had, the last date when exceptions or replies thereto are filed, or if exceptions are not filed, the expiration date for such exceptions or the date when all parties have stated that no exceptions will be filed; (c) in the case of an initial decision, the date of notice of the Administration to review the decision, if such notice is given.

              § 201.171
              Stay of Administration's decision.
              The Administration's decision or order shall be stayed pending resolution by the Administration of a petition for reopening, duly filed, and for so long as such Administration's action has not been finally disposed of in accordance with the provisions of section 7 of Department of Commerce Order 117 (Revised).
            
            
              § 201.172

              § 201.173
              Reopening by Administration and modification or setting aside of decision.
              Upon petition and a showing of compelling cause, filed in accordance with § 201.174, or on its own motion, the Administration may at any time reopen any proceeding under the regulation in this part for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration in whole or in part. After reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing or such other procedure as the Administration may direct, the Administration may alter, modify or set aside in whole or in part its decision therein if it finds such action is required by changed conditions in fact or law or by the public interest.
            
            
              
              § 201.174
              Petition for reopening.
              A petition for reopening for the purpose of rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration, shall be made in writing, shall state the grounds relied upon, and conform to the requirements of subpart D of this part. If the petition is for the purpose of rehearing, said petition shall state the nature and purpose of the new evidence to be adduced and that such evidence was not available at the time of the prior hearing. If the petition be for reargument or reconsideration, the matter claimed to have been erroneously decided shall be specified and the alleged errors briefly stated. In case of exceptional circumstances, satisfactorily shown by the petitioner, a request for modification of rules or orders may be made by telegram or otherwise, upon notice to all parties or attorneys of record, but such request shall be followed by a petition filed and served in accordance with subpart D of this part.
            
            
              § 201.175

            Subpart S—Judicial Standards of Practice (Rule 19)
            
              § 201.181
              General matters.
              (a) In general, the functions of the Administration involve hearing procedures comparable to those of a court and accordingly parties to proceedings before the Administration and persons representing these parties are expected to conduct themselves with honor and dignity. For the same reasons, the members of the Administration and those of its employees who participate with the Administration in the determination of formal proceedings are expected to conduct themselves with the same fidelity to standards of propriety that characterizes a court and its staff. The standing and the effectiveness of the Administration are in direct relation to the observance by it, its staff and the parties and attorneys appearing before it of the highest of judicial and professional ethics.
              (b) It is essential in cases to be determined after notice and hearing and upon a record, or in any other cases which the Administration by order may designate, that the judicial character of the Administration be recognized and protected. As a consequence, from the time of the filing of an application or a petition which can be granted by the Administration only after notice and opportunity for hearing, or in the case of other matters from the time of notice by the Administration that such matters shall be determined after notice and opportunity for hearing, no ex parte communications, as hereinafter defined, are to constitute or be considered part of the record on which the final decision is to be predicated.
            
            
              § 201.182
              Improper pressures.
              It is determined to be improper that there be any effort by any person interested in a case before the Administration to attempt to sway the judgment of the Administration by undertaking to bring pressure or influence to bear upon the Administration, its staff, or the presiding officer assigned to the proceeding. It is further determined to be improper that such interested persons or any member of the Administration's staff or the presiding officer directly or indirectly give statements to the press or radio, by paid advertisements or otherwise, designed to influence the Administration's judgment in the matter. In addition, it is further determined to be improper that any person solicit communications to the Administration or any of its members, its staff or the presiding officer in the case other than by counsel of record who shall serve copies thereof on all other parties to the proceeding.
            
            
              § 201.183
              Ex parte communications.

              (a) Requests for expeditious treatment of matters pending with the Administration are deemed communications on the merits and as such are improper except when forwarded from parties to a proceeding and served upon all other parties thereto. Such communications from parties to a proceeding should be in the form of a motion and are to be dealt with as such by the Administration, the presiding officer, and the parties to the proceeding. Any such request which is not made as a motion shall be placed in the public correspondence file and will not be considered by the Administration or any of its staff members or the presiding officer in connection with the disposition of the case.

              (b) Written or oral communications involving any substantive or procedural issue in a matter subject to public hearing directed to a Member of the Administration, its staff, or the presiding officer in the case, from any individual in private or public life shall be deemed a private communication in respect of the merits of the case. These communications, unless otherwise provided for by law or a published rule of the Administration are deemed ex parte communications and are not to be considered part of any record or the basis for any official action by the Administration, members of its staff or the presiding officer: Provided, however, That this prohibition shall not be determined to apply to informal petitions or applications filed with the Administration; the usual informal communications between counsel including discussions directed toward the development of a stipulation or settlement between parties; communications of a nature deemed proper in proceedings in U.S. Federal courts; and communications which merely inquire as to the status of a proceeding without discussing issues or expressing points of view. Any prohibited communications in writing received by a Member of the Administration, its staff or the presiding officer shall be made public by placing it in the correspondence file of the docket which is available for public inspection and will not be considered by the Administration or the presiding officer as part of the record for decision. If the ex parte communication is received orally, a memorandum setting forth the substance of the conversation shall be made and filed in the correspondence section of the appropriate public docket.

              The regulations in this part shall become effective October 23, 1964, and shall apply only to cases which are designated for hearing on or after October 23, 1964: Provided, however, That the regulations in this part shall be applicable to cases designated for hearing prior to October 23, 1964, if consolidated with a case designated for hearing on or after that date. All other cases designated for hearing prior to October 23, 1964, shall be governed by the rules in effect immediately prior to such date.

            Purpose.

            The rules of this part prescribe procedures relating to Secretarial review of any decision, report, order or action of the Maritime Subsidy Board (Board) pursuant to Department Order 117-A (31 FR 8087, 15331). Section 6 of Department Order 117-A is reprinted here for the convenience of the public.
            
            
              
                Sec. 6.
                Review and finality of actions by Maritime Subsidy Board. .01 The Secretary of Transportation (hereinafter referred to as “Secretary”) may, on his own motion or on the basis of a petition filed as hereinafter provided, review any decision, report and/or order of the Maritime Subsidy Board based on a hearing held pursuant to (a) statutory requirements or (b) Board order, by entering a written order stating that he elects to review the action of the Board. Copies of all orders for review shall be served on all parties of record (which phrase includes the Board). Petitions for review under this paragraph may be filed by parties of record, shall be in writing, and shall state the grounds upon which petitioner relies. Ten (10) copies of such petitions for review, together with proof of service thereof on all parties of record, shall be filed with the Secretary within fifteen (15) days after the date of the service of the Board's decision, report or order. Parties of record may file replies in writing thereto. Ten (10) copies of such replies, together with proof of service thereof on the petitioner and all other parties of record, shall be filed with the Secretary within ten (10) days after the date the petition for review is timely filed. Petitions for review and replies thereto shall be limited to the record before the Board. If a petition for review is filed within the time prescribed, a decision, report or order of the Board shall be final fifteen (15) days after expiration of the time prescribed for filing a reply thereto unless the Secretary, prior to expiration of the fifteen (15) days, enters a written order granting the petition for review. If no petition for review is filed within the time prescribed, a decision, report or order of the Board shall be final twenty (20) days after the date of service of the decision unless the Secretary, prior to expiration of the twenty (20) days, enters a written order stating that he elects to review the action of the Board. If upon any review the decision of the Secretary rests on official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, any party of record shall, if request is made within ten (10) days after the date of service of the Secretary's decision on said party, be afforded an opportunity to show the contrary. The said ten (10) days shall constitute the period for a “timely request” within the meaning of section 7(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act.
              .02 The Secretary may on his own motion review all actions of the Maritime Subsidy Board other than those referred to in paragraph .01 of this section by entering a written order stating that he elects to review the action of the Board. Any person having an interest in any action of the Board under this paragraph shall have the privilege of submitting to the Secretary within ten (10) days after the date of such Board action, a request that the Secretary undertake such review. Such request shall be in writing and shall state the grounds upon which the person submitting the same relies and his interest in the action for which review is requested. Ten (10) copies of such requests shall be submitted to the Secretary. Any other person having an interest in such matter shall have the privilege of submitting within fifteen (15) days after the date of the Board's action, a written request that the Secretary not exercise such review. Copies of request that the Secretary undertake or not exercise review will be open for public inspection at the office of the Secretary of the Board. If either a request that the Secretary undertake review or a request that he not exercise review is submitted within the time prescribed, an action of the Board shall be final in ten (10) days after expiration of the time prescribed for submission of a request that review not be exercised unless the Secretary, prior to the expiration of the ten (10) days, enters a written order stating that he elects to review the action of the Board. If neither a request that the Secretary undertake review nor a request that he not exercise review is submitted within the time prescribed, an action of the Board shall be final in twenty (20) days after the date of such action unless the Secretary, prior to expiration of the twenty (20) days, enters a written order stating that he elects to review the action of the Board. Copies of all orders for review shall be served upon the Board, and upon all persons filing requests as herein described.
              .03 If a timely petition for reconsideration is filed under the rules prescribed by the Board, the time for filing a petition or request for review by the Secretary under paragraph .01 or .02 of this section, respectively, or the entry of an order by the Secretary on his own motion electing to review an action of the Board under paragraph .01 or .02 of this section, shall, in the case of actions under paragraph .01 of this section run from the date of service of the Board's action and, in the case of actions under paragraph .02 of this section, run from the date of the Board's action, finally disposing of the issues presented by the petition for reconsideration.
              .04 In computing any period of time under this section, the time begins with the day following the act, event, or default, and includes the last day of the period unless it is Saturday, Sunday, or national legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or such holiday. The prescribed time for action by the Secretary in a proceeding in which additional days have been added pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be extended by the total of such additional days.
              .05 Petitions and requests for review by the Secretary shall not be filed:

              a. Unless the petitioner shall have first exhausted his administrative remedies (other than a petition for reconsideration) before the Maritime Subsidy Board; nor
              
              b. With respect to interlocutory decisions of the Maritime Subsidy Board in actions or proceedings referred to in paragraphs .01 and .02 of this section.
              .06 The Secretary may, for good cause and/or in order to prevent undue hardship in any particular case, waive or modify any procedural provision of this section by written order.

            § 203.1
            Scope of rules.
            (a) The provisions of this part apply to applications which involve statutorily mandated hearings under sections 605(c) and 805(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. app. 1175(c), 1223(a)), hereinafter referred to as the “Act”, conducted by the Maritime Administrator or Maritime Subsidy Board of the Maritime Administration, hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Administration”.
            (b) The provisions of this part are to be construed consistently with the Administration Rules of Practice and Procedure in 46 CFR part 201. If this part and 46 CFR part 201 conflict, this part shall govern.
          
          
            § 203.2
            Applications.

            (a) Notice of all applications subject to this part shall be published in the Federal Register, in accordance with the provisions of 46 CFR 201.72.
            (b) All applications under section 605(c) of the Act shall specify, at a minimum, full details of the existing or proposed new or amended service, to include itineraries and the number and type of vessels currently operated in the trade or trade route, the number and type of vessels proposed to be operated in the trade or trade route, the frequency of sailings and port calls and the nature and extent of U.S.-flag and any foreign-flag competition. As a matter of discretion, the Administration may request additional information, which may be protected by a confidentiality ruling, if justified. If the application is one for additional service on a route in which the applicant has an established service, or for an existing service, then the applicant must include information on its previous three years of operation. Applicants for permission under section 805(a) of the Act must describe clearly the scope of permission sought, including details of proposed domestic service and existing or proposed foreign service, as well as the applicant's operating structure.
            (c) Applications under section 605(c) of the Act shall be filed on Form MA-964, in accordance with the instructions annexed thereto. Copies of Form MA-964 may be obtained on request from the Secretary of the Administration.
            (d) Applications for permission under section 805(a) of the Act shall be submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth in 46 CFR part 380, and shall comply with all of the requirements of that part.
          
          
            § 203.3
            Opposition to applications.
            (a) Required documents. A person seeking to oppose an application shall file with the Secretary of the Administration, and concurrently serve upon the applicant, a petition for leave to intervene, together with an answer, within the time period specified in the Federal Register notice of the application. Normally, twenty days will be provided.
            (b) Petition for leave to intervene. The petition for leave to intervene shall specify the basis upon which such person asserts a right to intervene and shall set forth with particularity:

            (1) The number and type of U.S.-flag vessels currently operated by the person seeking intervention in the trade or trade route to which the application pertains.
            
            (2) The frequency of sailings of vessels operated by such person in the trade or trade route to which the application pertains in the 36 calendar months immediately preceding the date of the application.
            (3) The specific ports of call conducted by such person in the trade or trade route to which the application pertains in the 36 calendar months immediately preceding the date of the application.
            (4) The average annual carriage by such person for the past 36 months on the trade route to which the application pertains.
            (5) If applicable, specific information detailing firm and definite plans for the inauguration of a new service, including, as appropriate, but not limited to, approval by the board of directors or general partners, membership in applicable conference agreements, office openings or the retention of agents in the proposed service area, acquisition of vessels and related equipment, subsidy applications, applications for any needed Government approvals or advertisement for the proposed service.
            (6) Such other information as the person believes should be considered in a determination of such person's right to intervene.
            (c) Answer. (1) The answer shall be simultaneously filed with the petition for leave to intervene and shall specify the basis upon which such person asserts the application should be denied or granted subject to modifications.
            (2) The answer shall set forth with particularity:
            (i) The ground upon which opposition is based;
            (ii) The factual matters which such person believes must be determined by the Administration;
            (iii) The legal matters which such person believes must be determined by the Administration;
            (iv) For each factual and legal matter raised such person's position and basis therefor; and
            (v) The precise nexus between each factual and legal matter raised and the decision of the Administration.
            (d) Right to intervene in Opposition to applications. (1) Leave to intervene in opposition to applications under section 605(c) of the Act will only be granted to operators of U.S.-flag vessels, and only to the extent, as demonstrated by the petition for leave to intervene, that such person provides an existing service, or that such person has firm and definite plans to provide a service, by a showing that its vessels operate in the same trade or on the same trade route as that proposed by the applicant and so operate in a manner competitive with the specific service proposed by the applicant. Although persons seeking intervention need not call at the same specific ports proposed by the applicant by direct vessel calls, any filing based on intermodal service in opposition to an application shall demonstrate that such person regularly competes by intermodal service for cargo moving to or from ports in the service proposed by the applicant. The burden of demonstrating competition between the vessels of the person seeking intervention and those of the applicant will be with the person seeking such intervention. Leave to intervene will not be granted to those conducting a competing service on an intermittent or de minimis basis.
            (2) Leave to intervene in opposition to applications under section 805(a) of the Act will be granted, as provided in the statute, to every person, firm, or corporation “having any interest” in such application.

            Replies.

            § 203.5
            Types of hearings.
            (a) Oral Evidentiary Hearing: If, upon review of the application, answers, petitions to intervene and replies, the Administration determines that the proceeding involves a disputed issue of material fact which cannot be resolved on the basis of available information of record, and that the case is anticipated to involve the submission of extensive evidence, or the Administration determines that it is otherwise appropriate, the Administration may issue an order referring the case to an Administrative Law Judge for oral evidentiary hearing. Such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set out in 46 CFR part 201. The Administration may resolve issues of intervention in such order or refer such issues to the Administrative Law Judge. The burden of establishing that there is a disputed issue of material fact is upon the party seeking the oral evidentiary hearing.
            (b) Hearing on Submission of Written Evidence and Argument: If, upon review of the application, answers, petitions to intervene and replies, the Administration determines that the proceeding involves a disputed issue of material fact which cannot be resolved on the basis of available information of record, but which is not anticipated to involve the submission of extensive evidence, the Administration may fulfill the hearing requirement in sections 605(c) and 805(a) of the Act by rendering a decision solely on the merits of papers submitted, provided that a full and true disclosure of the facts is made and such procedure is fair to all parties. The Administration may, in its discretion, direct the submission of briefs on legal issues together with evidence in written form, and/or the holding of oral argument before the Administration prior to issuing its final decision on the proceeding.
            (c) Show Cause Proceeding: If, upon review of the application, answers, petitions to intervene and replies, the Administration determines that the proceeding does not or is not likely to involve a disputed issue of material fact or that if such facts exist they can be resolved on the basis of available information subject to official notice, and if the case is not anticipated to involve the submission of extensive evidence, the Administration may determine to handle the matter by show-cause proceeding. In that event, it will issue a decision setting out its tentative conclusions on all of the matters of fact and law at issue in the proceeding. A Notice summarizing such decision shall be published in the Federal Register in accordance with 46 CFR 201.72. Interested persons may file comments, including support or rebuttal for any matter officially noticed, within 30 days of the date of service of the tentative decision and responses to such comments shall be filed within ten days thereafter unless a shorter or longer period is provided by the Administration for such comments and answers.
          
          
            § 203.6
            Oral evidentiary hearing before one or more members.
            If an oral evidentiary hearing is to be conducted, the Maritime Administration, or the Maritime Subsidy Board or one or more of its members, may conduct such hearing. A member who is not present at the hearing may participate in the consideration and the decision of the case where the oral evidentiary hearing, if held, has been stenographically recorded in full and transcribed for the member's review.

            Scope and procedure for filing claims.
            This part prescribes the requirements and procedure for administrative settlement of claims against the United States, involving the Maritime Administration, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, based on death, personal injury, or damage to or loss of property. The controlling regulations are promulgated by the Department of Justice at 28 CFR Part 14—Administrative Claims Under Federal Tort Claims Act. These regulations supplement those of the Department of Justice and provide specific guidance regarding claims processing in the Maritime Administration.
          
          
            
            § 204.2
            Claims payable.
            Claims for death, personal injury, or damage to or loss of real or personal property are payable when the death, injury or damage is caused by a negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the Maritime Administration, while acting within the scope of employment and under circumstances in which the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant under the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
          
          
            § 204.3
            Claims not payable.
            A claim is not payable under the regulations in this part 204, if such tort claim is excluded from the scope of the Federal Tort Claims Act, as amended, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2680.
          
          
            § 204.4
            Time limitations on claims.
            (a) A claim can be settled only if presented in writing within two years after it accrues.
            (b) The two year statute of limitations is not tolled until the Office of the Chief Counsel of the Maritime Administration receives from a claimant, or the claimant's duly authorized agent or legal representative, an executed Standard Form 95, “Claims for Damage, Injury, or Death,” or written notification of an incident, together with a claim for money damages in a sum certain, for death, personal injury, or damage to or loss of real or personal property. When a claim is received in any office, mail unit, or other Maritime Administration activity other than the Office of the Chief Counsel, such office, unit or activity shall transmit it to the Office of the Chief Counsel without delay.

            (a) If a claim is approved (either for the amount claimed or less than such full amount), the claimant, prior to the disbursement of an award, shall sign a document releasing the United States, its agents and employees from all further claims relating to the incident giving rise to the approved claim.
            (b) If the claim is finally denied, the official vested with such authority shall inform the claimant by certified or registered mail of the final denial of the claim. Notification of final denial shall include a statement that a claimant who does not accept or is dissatisfied with the action may institute suit against the United States not later than six months after the date of mailing of the notice of final denial.
            (c) A claimant may regard the failure of the Maritime Administration to make a final disposition of a claim within six months after the date of receipt of the claim by the Maritime Administration as a final denial for the purpose of filing suit.
          
          
            § 204.6
            Payment of claims.

            (b) If a claimant is represented by an attorney, both the claimant and the claimant's attorney shall be designated as payees on any check delivered to the claimant's attorney.
          
          
            § 204.7
            Delegation of authority.
            (a) Subject to written approval of the Attorney General of the United States of any payment in excess of $100,000, the Chief Counsel of the Maritime Administration is authorized to approve the award, compromise, or settlement of any tort claim and to authorize payment of the claim.
            (b) The Chief Counsel is authorized to deny any claim and to settle and authorize payment of any tort claim involving the Maritime Administration in an amount not exceeding $100,000.

            (c) We will notify you, in writing, if you must submit additional facts for our consideration of the appeal. We will notify you, in writing, once the Administrator has made a decision regarding your appeal.
          
          
            § 205.4
            Finality of decisions.

              § 221.15
              Approval for transfer of registry or operation under authority of a foreign country or for scrapping in a foreign country.
              In no case will approval be granted to place under foreign registry or to operate under the authority of a foreign country a Fishing Vessel, Fish Processing Vessel, or Fish Tender Vessel that has had its fishery endorsement revoked pursuant to Appendix D of Public Law 106-554, 114 Stat 2763. Subject to this exclusion, approval requests will be considered as set forth in this section.
              (a) Vessels of under 1,000 gross tons. (1) The Maritime Administrator hereby grants approval for the Transfer to foreign registry and flag or Operation Under the Authority of a Foreign Country or for scrapping in a foreign country of Documented Vessels or vessels the last documentation of which was under the laws of the United States and which are of under 1,000 gross tons if at the time of such Transfer there are no liens or encumbrances recorded against the vessel in the U.S. Coast Guard Documentation Office at its last U.S. port of record.
              (2) This approval shall not apply if the vessel is to be placed under the registry, or operated under the authority of, or scrapped in any country listed in § 221.13(a)(4) of this part.

              (3) This approval shall not apply to any such Transfer proposed to be made during any period when the United States is at war or during any national emergency, the existence of which has invoked the provisions of 46 U.S.C. 56102, or to any such Transfer proposed to be made to a citizen of any country when such transfer would be contrary to the foreign policy of the United States as declared by an executive department of the United States.
              
              (b) Vessels of 1,000 gross tons or more. (1) Applications for approval of Transfer to foreign registry and flag or Operation Under the Authority of a Foreign Country or for scrapping in a foreign country of Documented Vessels or vessels the last documentation of which was under the laws of the United States and which are of 1,000 gross tons or more will be evaluated in light of—
              (i) The type, size speed, general condition, and age of the vessel;
              (ii) The acceptability of the owner, proposed transferee and the country of registry or the country under the authority of which the vessel is to be operated; and
              (iii) The need to retain the vessel under U.S. documentation, ownership or control for purposes of national defense, maintenance of an adequate merchant marine, foreign policy considerations or the national interest.
              (2) If the application is found to be acceptable under the criteria of this paragraph, approval will be granted. For vessels of under 3,000 gross tons, in the absence of unusual circumstances, no conditions will be imposed on the transfer. For vessels of 3,000 gross tons and above, approval will be granted upon acceptance by the owner of the terms and conditions referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, as applicable. Additional terms deemed appropriate by the Maritime Administrator may be imposed. The terms and conditions shall be contained in an Approval Notice and Agreement (“Contract”) executed prior to issuance of the Transfer Order. Unless otherwise specified, the terms and conditions shall remain in effect for the period of the remaining economic life of the vessel or for the duration of a national emergency proclaimed by the President prior or subsequent to such Transfer, whichever period is longer. The economic life of a vessel for purposes of this regulation is deemed to be twenty (20) years for tankers and other liquid bulk carriers and twenty-five (25) years for other vessel types. This period is to be calculated from the date the vessel was originally accepted for delivery from the shipbuilder, but may be extended for such additional period of time as may be determined by the Maritime Administrator if the vessel has been substantially rebuilt or modified in a manner that warrants such extension.
              (c) Foreign transfer other than for scrapping. If the foreign Transfer of a vessel referred to in paragraph (b) of this section is other than for the purpose of scrapping the vessel and other than a Transfer to the government of an acceptable foreign country, and in the absence of unusual circumstances as determined by the Maritime Administrator (for example a Transfer to an entity controlled by the government of an acceptable foreign country), the following conditions will be imposed on the transferee:
              (1) Ownership. (i) Without the prior written approval of the Maritime Administrator, there shall be no further Transfer of ownership, change in the registry or Operation of such vessel Under the Authority of a Foreign Country; provided, however, that, if the Transfer of ownership is to a Citizen of the United States or other entity qualified under 46 U.S.C. 12102(a) to document a vessel and the vessel is thereafter documented under U.S. law, no prior written approval shall be required but the transferee shall notify the Vessel Transfer Officer in writing of such change in the ownership and the U.S. documentation within thirty (30) days after such change in ownership and documentation.
              (ii) The restrictions contained in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall not be applicable to a change in ownership resulting from the death of the vessel owner, so long as notification of any such Transfer of ownership occurring by reason of death shall be filed with the Vessel Transfer Officer within 60 days from the date of such Transfer identifying with particularity the name, legal capacity, citizenship, current domicile or address of, or other method of direct communication with, the transferee(s).
              (2) Requisition. The vessel shall, if requested by the United States, be sold or Chartered to the United States on the same terms and conditions upon which a vessel owned by a Citizen of the United States or documented under U.S. law could be requisitioned for purchase or Charter pursuant to 46 U.S.C. chapters 563 and 565. If the vessel is under the flag of a country that is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Maritime Administrator will consider this condition satisfied if the owner furnishes satisfactory evidence that the vessel is already in noncommercial service under the direction of the government of a NATO country.
              (3) Trade. Without the prior written approval of the Maritime Administrator, the vessel shall not carry cargoes of any kind to or from, or be operated commercially while within the waters of (as distinct from passage through), a country referred to in § 221.13(a)(4) of this part, nor shall there be any Charter or other Transfer of an interest in the vessel, other than to a Citizen of the United States, for carriage of cargoes of any kind to or from, or for commercial operation while within the waters of (as distinct from passage through), any such country.
              (4) Default. In the event of default under any or all of the conditions set forth in paragraphs (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section, the owner shall pay to the Maritime Administration, without prejudice to any other rights that the United States may have, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, the sum of not less than $25,000 or more than $1,000,000, as specified in the contract, and the vessel shall be subject to the penalties imposed by 46 App. U.S.C. 808 and 839. Pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 56105, the Maritime Administrator may remit forfeiture of the vessel upon such conditions as may be required under the circumstances of the particular case, including the payment of a sum in lieu of forfeiture, and execution of a new agreement containing substantially the same conditions set forth above and such others as the Maritime Administrator may deem appropriate and which will be applicable to the vessel for the remaining period of the original agreement. In order to secure the payment of any such sums of money as may be required as a result of default, the transferee shall contractually agree, in form and substance approved by the Chief Counsel of the Maritime Administration, to comply with the above conditions and to provide a United States commercial surety bond or other surety acceptable to the Maritime Administrator for an amount not less than $25,000 and not more than $1,000,000, depending upon the type, size and condition of the vessel. “Other surety” may be any one of the following:
              (i) An irrevocable letter of credit, which is acceptable to the Maritime Administrator, issued or guaranteed by a Citizen of the United States or by a federally insured depository institution;
              (ii) A pledge of United States Government securities;
              (iii) The written guarantee of a friendly government of which the transferee is a national;
              (iv) A written guarantee or bond by a United States corporation found by the Maritime Administrator to be financially qualified to service the undertaking to pay the stipulated amount;
              (v) If the transferee is controlled in any manner by one or more Citizens of the United States, a contractual agreement in form and substance acceptable to the Chief Counsel of the Maritime Administration by the transferee and the Citizens of the United States with authority to exercise such control, if found by the Maritime Administrator to be financially qualified, jointly and severally to pay the stipulated amount, such agreement to be secured by the written guarantee of the transferee and each of the Citizens of the United States or other form of guarantee as may be required by the Maritime Administrator; or
              (vi) Any other surety acceptable to the Maritime Administrator and approved as to form and substance by the Chief Counsel of the Maritime Administration.
              (d) Foreign transfer for scrapping. If the transfer of control, whether or not there is a transfer of registry, of a vessel referred to in paragraph (b) of this section is for the purpose of scrapping the vessel abroad, the following conditions will be imposed on the transferee:
              (1) The vessel or any interest therein shall not be subsequently sold to any Person without the prior written approval of the Maritime Administrator, nor shall it be used for the carriage of cargo or passengers of any kind whatsoever.

              (2) Within a period of 18 months from the date of approval of the sale, the hull of the vessel shall be completely scrapped, dismantled, dismembered, or destroyed in such manner and to such extent as to prevent the further use thereof, or any part thereof, as a ship, barge, or any other means of transportation.
              (3) The scrap resulting from the demolition of the hull of the vessel, the engines, machinery, and major items of equipment shall not be sold to, or utilized by, any citizen or instrumentality of a country referred to in § 221.13(a)(4) of the part, nor may such scrap be exported to these countries. The engines, machinery and major items of equipment shall not be exported to destinations within the United States.
              (4) In the event of default under any or all of the conditions set forth in paragraphs (d) (1), (2) or (3) of this section, the transferee shall pay to the Maritime Administration, without prejudice to any other rights that the United States may have, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, the sum of not less than $25,000 or more than $1,000,000, as specified in the contract, depending upon the size, type and condition of the vessel. This payment shall be secured by a surety company bond or other surety satisfactory to the Maritime Administrator. “Other surety” may be one of those set out in paragraph (c)(4) (i) through (vi) of this section.
              (5) There shall be filed with the Vessel Transfer Officer a certificate or other evidence satisfactory to the Chief Counsel of the Maritime Administration, duly attested and authenticated by a United States Consul, that the scrapping of the vessel (hull only) and disposal or utilization of the resultant scrap and the engines, machinery and major items of equipment have been accomplished in accord with paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section.
              (e) Resident agent for service. (1) Any proposed foreign transferee shall, prior to the issuance and delivery of the Transfer Order covering the vessel or vessels to be transferred, designate and appoint a resident agent in the United States to receive and accept service of process or other notice in any action or proceeding instituted by the United States relating to any claim arising out of the approved transaction.
              (2) The resident agent designated and appointed by the foreign transferee shall be subject to approval by the Maritime Administrator. To be acceptable, the resident agent must maintain a permanent place of business in the United States and shall be a banking or lending institution, a ship-owner or ship-operating corporation or other business entity that is satisfactory to the Maritime Administrator.
              (3) Appointment and designation of the resident agent shall not be terminated, revoked, amended or altered without the prior written approval of the Maritime Administrator.
              (4) The foreign transferee shall file with the Vessel Transfer Officer a written copy of the appointment of the resident agent, which copy shall be fully endorsed by the resident agent stating that it accepts the appointment, that it will act thereunder and that it will notify the Vessel Transfer Officer in writing in the event it becomes disqualified from so acting by reason of any legal restrictions. Service of process or notice upon any officer, agent or employee of the resident agent at its permanent place of business shall constitute effective service on, or notice to, the foreign transferee.
              (f) Administrative provisions. (1) The subsequent Transfer of ownership or registry of vessels that have been Transferred to foreign ownership or registry or both, or to Operation Under the Authority of a Foreign Country, that remain subject to Maritime Administration contractual control as set forth above, will be subject to substantially the same Maritime Administration policy considerations that governed the original Transfer, including such changes or modifications that have subsequently been made and continued in effect. Approval of these subsequent Transfers will be subject to the same terms and conditions governing the foreign Transfer at the time of the previous Transfer, as modified (if applicable).

              (2) The authorization for all approved transactions, either by virtue of U.S.C. chapter 561 or the Maritime Administration's Contract with the vessel owner, will be by notification in the form of a Transfer Order upon receipt of the executed Contract, the required bond or other surety, and other supporting documentation required by the Contract.
              (3) In order that the Maritime Administration's records may be maintained on a current basis, the transferor and transferee of the vessel are required to notify the Vessel Transfer Officer of the date and place where the approved transaction was completed, and the name of the vessel, if changed. This information relating to the completion of the transaction and any change in name shall be furnished as soon as possible, but not later than 10 days after the same has occurred.

              (a) A Documented Vessel may be sold by order of a district court only to a Person eligible to own a Documented Vessel or to a mortgagee of the vessel. Unless waived by the Maritime Administrator, a Person purchasing the vessel pursuant to court order or from a mortgagee not eligible to document a vessel who purchased the vessel pursuant to a court order must document the vessel under chapter 121 of title 46, United States Code.
              (b) A Person purchasing the vessel, pursuant to court order or from a mortgagee not eligible to document a vessel who purchased the vessel pursuant to a court order, and wishing to obtain waiver of the documentation requirement must submit a request including the reason therefor to the Vessel Transfer Officer.
              (c)(1) A mortgagee not eligible to own a Documented Vessel shall not operate, or cause operation of, the vessel in commerce. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the vessel may not be operated for any purpose without the prior written approval of the Maritime Administrator.
              (2) The Maritime Administrator hereby grants approval for a mortgagee not eligible to own a Documented Vessel to operate the vessel to the extent necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel or for repairs, drydocking or berthing changes, but only under the command of a Citizen of the United States.

              § 221.19
              Possession or sale of vessels by mortgagees or trustees other than pursuant to court order.
              (a) A mortgagee or a trustee of a preferred mortgage on a Documented Vessel that is not eligible to own a Documented Vessel does not require the express approval of the Maritime Administrator to take possession of the vessel in the event of default by the mortgagor other than by foreclosure pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 31329, if provided for in the mortgage or a related financing document, but in such event the vessel may not be operated, or caused to be operated, in commerce. The vessel may not, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, be operated for any other purpose unless approved in writing by the Maritime Administrator, nor may the vessel be sold to a Noncitizen without the approval of the Maritime Administrator.
              (b) The Maritime Administrator hereby grants approval for such mortgagee or trustee to operate the vessel to the extent necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel, for its direct return to the United States or for its movement within the United States, or for repairs, drydocking or berthing changes, but only under the command of a Citizen of the United States.

              (c) A Noncitizen mortgagee that has brought a civil action in rem for enforcement of a preferred mortgage lien on a citizen-owned Documented Vessel pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 31325(b)(1) may petition the court pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 31325(e)(1) for appointment of a receiver and, if the receiver is Person eligible to own a Documented Vessel, to authorize the receiver to operate the mortgaged vessel on such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate. If the receiver is not a Citizen of the United States, the vessel may not be operated in coastwise trade without prior written approval of the Maritime Administrator.

              § 221.63
              Investigation.

              (a) When the Vessel Transfer Office obtains information that a Person may have violated a statute or regulation for which a civil penalty may be assessed under this subpart, that Officer may investigate the matter and decide whether there is sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case that a violation occurred.
              (b) If that Officer decides there is a prima facie case, then that Officer may enter into a stipulation with the Party in accordance with § 221.67 of this subpart, or may refer the matter directly to a Hearing Officer for procedures in accordance with § 221.73 to 221.89 of this subpart.
            
            
              § 221.65
              Criteria for determining penalty.
              In determining any penalties assessed, the Vessel Transfer Officer under § 221.67 and the Hearing Officer under §§ 221.73 to 221.89 of this part shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation committed and, with respect to the Party, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to pay and other matters that justice requires.
            
            
              § 221.67
              Stipulation procedure.
              (a) When the Vessel Transfer Office decides to proceed under this section, that Office shall notify the Party in writing by registered or certified mail—
              (1) Of the alleged violation and the applicable statute and regulations;
              (2) Of the maximum penalty that may be assessed for each violation;
              (3) Of a summary of the evidence supporting the violation;
              (4) Of the penalty that the Vessel Transfer Officer will accept in settlement of the violation;
              (5) Of the right to examine all the material in the case file and have a copy of all written documents provided upon request;
              (6) That by accepting the penalty, the Party waives the right to have the matter considered by a Hearing Officer in accordance with §§ 221.73 to 221.89 of this subpart, and that if the Party elects to have the matter considered by a Hearing Officer, the Hearing Officer may assess a penalty less than, equal to, or greater than that stipulated in settlement if the Hearing Officer finds that a violation occurred; and
              (7) That a violation will be kept on record and may be used by the Maritime Administration in aggravation of an assessment of a penalty for a subsequent violation by that Party.
              (b) Upon receipt of the notification specified in paragraph (a) of this section, a Party may within 30 days—
              (1) Agree to the stipulated penalty in the manner specified in the notification; or

              (2) Notify in writing the Vessel Transfer Officer that the Party elects to have the matter considered by a Hearing Officer in accordance with the procedure specified in §§ 221.73 through 221.89 of this subpart.
              (c) If, within 30 days of receipt of the notification specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Party neither agrees to the penalty nor elects the informal hearing procedure, the Party will be deemed to have waived its right to the informal hearing procedure and the penalty will be considered accepted. If a monetary penalty is assessed, it is due and payable to the United States, and the Maritime Administration may initiate appropriate action to collect the penalty.
            
            
              § 221.69
              Hearing Officer.
              (a) The Hearing Officer shall have no responsibility, direct or supervisory, for the investigation of cases referred for the assessment of civil penalties.
              (b) The Hearing Officer shall decide each case on the basis of the evidence before him or her, and must have no prior connection with the case. The Hearing Officer is solely responsible for the decision in each case referred to him or her.
              (c) The Hearing Officer is authorized to administer oaths and issue subpoenas necessary to the conduct of a hearing, to the extent provided by law.

              Hearing Officer referral.
              If, pursuant to § 221.67(b)(2) of this subpart, a Party elects to have the matter referred to a Hearing Officer, the Vessel Transfer Officer may—
              (a) Decide not to proceed with penalty action, close the case, and notify the Party in writing that the case has been closed; or
              (b) Refer the matter to a Hearing Officer with the case file and a record of any prior violations by the Party.
            
            
              § 221.73
              Initial Hearing Officer consideration.
              (a) When a case is received for action, the Hearing Officer shall examine the material submitted. If the Hearing Officer determines that there is insufficient evidence to proceed, or that there is any other reason which would make penalty action inappropriate, the Hearing Officer shall return the case to the Vessel Transfer Officer with a written statement of the reason. The Vessel Transfer Officer may close the case or investigate the matter further. If additional evidence supporting a violation is discovered, the Vessel Transfer Officer may resubmit the matter to the Hearing Officer.
              (b) If the Hearing Officer determines that there is reason to believe that a violation has been committed, the Hearing Officer notifies the Party in writing by registered or certified mail of—
              (1) The alleged violation and the applicable statute and regulations;
              (2) The maximum penalty that may be assessed for each violation;
              (3) The general nature of the procedure for assessing and collecting the penalty;
              (4) The amount of the penalty that appears to be appropriate, based on the material then available to the Hearing Officer;
              (5) The right to examine all the material in the case file and have a copy of all written documents provided upon requests; and
              (6) The right to request a hearing.
              (c) If at any time it appears that the addition of another Party to the proceedings is necessary or desirable, the Hearing Officer will provide the additional Party and the Party alleged to be in violation with notice as described above.
              (d) At any time during a proceeding, before the Hearing Officer issues a decision under § 221.89, the Hearing Officer and the Party may agree to a Settlement of the case.
            
            
              § 221.75

              (a) Within 30 days after receipt of notice from the Hearing Officer, the Party, or counsel for the Party, may—
              (1) Pay the amount specified in the notice as being appropriate;
              (2) In writing request a hearing, specifying the issues in dispute; or
              (3) Submit written evidence or arguments in lieu of a hearing.
              (b) The right to a hearing is waived if the Party does not submit a request to the Hearing Officer within 30 days after receipt of notice from the Hearing Officer, unless additional time has been granted by the Hearing Officer.

              (c) The Hearing Officer has discretion as to the venue and scheduling of a hearing. The hearing will normally be held at the office of the Hearing Officer. A request for a change of location of a hearing or transfer to another Hearing Officer must be in writing and state the reasons why the requested action is necessary or desirable. Action on the request is at the discretion of the Hearing Officer.
              (d) A Party who has requested a hearing may amend the specification of the issues in dispute at any time up to 10 days before the scheduled date of the hearing. Issues raised later than 10 days before the schedule hearing may be presented only at the discretion of the Hearing Officer.
            
            
              § 221.77
              Disclosure of evidence.
              The Party shall, upon request, be provided a free copy of all the evidence in the case file, except material that would disclose or lead to the disclosure of the identity of a confidential informant and any other information properly exempt from disclosure.
            
            
              § 221.79
              Request for confidential treatment.
              (a) In addition to information treated as confidential under § 221.77 of this subpart, a request for confidential treatment of a document or portion thereof may be made by the Person supplying the information on the basis that the information is—
              (1) Confidential financial information, trade secrets, or other material exempt from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552);
              (2) Required to be held in confidence by 18 U.S.C. 1905; or
              (3) Otherwise exempt by law from disclosure.
              (b) The Person desiring confidential treatment must submit the request to the Hearing Officer in writing and the reasons justifying nondisclosure. The Hearing Officer shall forward any request for confidential treatment to the appropriate official of the Maritime Administration for a determination hereon. Failure to make a timely request may result in a document being considered as nonconfidential and subject to release.
              (c) Confidential material shall not be considered by the Hearing Officer in reaching a decision unless—
              (1) It has been furnished by a Party; or
              (2) It has been furnished pursuant to a subpoena.

              Counsel.
              A Party has the right to be represented at all stages of the proceeding by counsel. After receiving notification that a Party is represented by counsel, the Hearing Officer will direct all further communications to that counsel.
            
            
              § 221.83
              Witnesses.
              A Party may present the testimony of any witness either through a personal appearance or through a written statement. The Party may request the assistance of the Hearing Officer in obtaining the personal appearance of a witness. The request must be in writing and state the reasons why a written statement would be inadequate, the issue or issues to which the testimony would be relevant, and the substance of the expected testimony. If the Hearing Officer determines that the personal appearance of the witness may materially aid in the decision on the case, the Hearing Officer will seek to obtain the witness' appearance. The Hearing Officer may move the hearing to the witness' location, accept a written statement, or accept a stipulation in lieu of testimony.
            
            
              § 221.85

              (a) The Hearing Officer shall conduct a fair and impartial proceeding in which the Party is given a full opportunity to be heard. At the opening of a hearing, the Hearing Officer shall advise the Party of the nature of the proceedings and of the alleged violation.
              (b) The material in the case file pertinent to the issues to be determined by the Hearing Officer shall first be presented. The Party may examine, respond to and rebut this material. The Party may offer any facts, statements, explanations, documents, sworn or unsworn testimony, or other exculpatory items that bear on the issues, or which may be relevant to the size of an appropriate penalty. The Hearing Officer may require the authentication of any written exhibit or statement.

              (c) At the close of the Party's presentation of evidence, the Hearing Officer may allow the introduction of rebuttal evidence. The Hearing Officer may allow the Party to respond to rebuttal evidence submitted.
              (d) In receiving evidence, the Hearing Officer shall not be bound by the strict rules of evidence. In evaluating the evidence presented, the Hearing Officer shall give due consideration to the reliability and relevance of each item of evidence.
              (e) After the evidence in the case has been presented, the Party may present argument on the issues in the case. The party may also request an opportunity to submit a written statement for consideration by the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer shall allow a reasonable time for submission of the statement and shall specify the date by which it must be received. If the statement is not received within the specified time, the Hearing Officer may render a decision in the case without consideration of the statement.
            
            
              § 221.87
              Records.
              (a) A verbatim transcript of a hearing will not normally be prepared. The Hearing Officer will prepare notes on material and points raised by the Party in sufficient detail to permit a full and fair review of the case.
              (b) A Party may, at its own expense, cause a verbatim transcript to be made, in which event the Party shall submit, without charge, two copies to the Hearing Officer within 30 days of the close of the hearing.
            
            
              § 221.89
              Hearing Officer's decision.
              (a) The Hearing Officer shall issue a written decision. Any decision to assess a penalty shall be based on substantial evidence in the record, and shall state the basis for the decision.
              (b) If the Hearing Officer finds that there is not substantial evidence in the record establishing the alleged violation, the Hearing Officer shall dismiss the case. A dismissal is without prejudice to the Vessel Transfer Officer's right to refile the case if additional evidence is obtained. A dismissal following a rehearing is final and with prejudice.
              (c) The Hearing Officer shall notify the Party in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the decision and, if adverse, shall advise the Party of the right to an administrative appeal to the Maritime Administrator or an individual designated by the Administrator from that decision.
              (d) If an appeal is not filed within the prescribed time, the decision of the Hearing Officer constitutes final agency action in the case.

              Appeals.
              (a) Any appeal from the decision of the Hearing Officer must be submitted in writing by the Party to the Hearing Officer within 30 days from the date of receipt of the Hearing Officer's decision.
              (b) The only issues that will be considered on appeal are those issues specified in the appeal which were raised before the Hearing Officer and jurisdictional questions.
              (c) There is no right to oral argument on an appeal.
              (d) The Maritime Administrator or an individual designated by the Administrator will issue a written decision on the appeal, and may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision, or remand the case for new or additional proceedings. In the absence of a remand, the decision on appeal is final agency action.
              (e) The Maritime Administrator or an individual designated by the Administrator shall notify the Party in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the decision on appeal and, if adverse, shall advise the Party of the right of appeal to the courts.
            
            
              § 221.93

              Within 30 days after receipt of the Hearing Officer's decision, or a decision on appeal, the Party must submit payment of any assessed penalty in the manner specified in the decision letter. Failure to make timely payment will result in the institution of appropriate action to collect the penalty.

            § 232.1
            Purpose and applicability.
            (a) Purpose. The purpose of this regulation is to establish uniform reporting requirements for the preparation of financial reports and submissions of information to the Maritime Administration. The Maritime Administration will, as necessary, issue clarifying instructions to those subject to these reporting requirements to assist in their interpretation and application. The uniform reporting requirements consist of:
            (1) A chart of accounts defined in this regulation.
            (2) Standard financial report formats, set forth in Form MA-172 (Revised).
            (b) Applicability. This regulation is application to all participants in financial assistant programs administered by the Maritime Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, that are required to file periodic financial reports with that agency.
            [48 FR 30122, June 30, 1983, as amended at 58 FR 62043, Nov. 24, 1993]
          
          
            § 232.2
            General instructions.
            (a) Use of generally accepted accounting principles. All contractors shall conform their accounting policies to generally accepted accounting principles (promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants).
            (b) Need to conform accounting information. All contractors may continue to use their current accounting system, if the system provides a basis for the preparation of reports in the prescribed formats and is consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.
            (c) Reconciliation of financial reports. When a program participant issues certified financial statements following accounting policies different from those followed for the financial statement filed with the Maritime Administration (such as reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, public service commissions or other regulatory agencies, or reports using other acceptable accounting methods differing from methods used for this regulation's purposes), the program participant shall clearly set forth the nature and amount of each adjustment necessary to reconcile the published statements with those filed with the Maritime Administration.
            (d) Submission of questions. (1) A contractor may submit in writing, or by electronic options (such as facsimile and Internet), if practicable, any question involving the interpretation of any provision of this part for consideration and decision to the Director, Office of Financial and Rate Approvals, for the Maritime Security Program, or Director, Office of Ship Financing, for the Maritime Loan Guarantee Program (Title XI), Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Appeals from such interpretation will be in accordance with the interpretation letter.
            (2) A contractor who has a question of financial accounting or reporting procedure pending before the Maritime Administration at the time a financial report is due shall file the report in accordance with established scheduled dates. The contractor shall include in the report a footnote disclosure that adequately describes the question pending, the manner of presentation in the report, and the relative impact on the balance sheet and income statement, respectively.
            (e) Effective Date. This regulation is effective as of December 27, 1993 and its requirements are mandatory for financial reports for accounting periods ending on or after December 31, 1993.
            [48 FR 30122, June 30, 1983, as amended at 58 FR 62043, Nov. 24, 1993; 68 FR 62537, Nov. 5, 2003; 69 FR 61449, Oct. 19, 2004]
          
          
            § 232.3
            Chart of accounts.
            (a) Purpose of accounts. A contractor shall use this chart of accounts as a guide for preparing the financial statements and for other required financial reports required to be submitted to the Maritime Administration. However, whenever there is a conflict between the meaning of any term used in the Chart of Accounts in this part 232 and that stated in any revision to generally accepted accounting principles, the meaning of the latter shall control and shall be followed.
            (b) Account numbers. Contractors are not required to use these account numbers or titles for their internal accounting.

              (iii) Records shall be maintained by vessel for each trade route or service area in which a vessel subject to an ODSA operates.
              (iv) If ODS is accrued at substantially different rates developed by the contractor applicable to any year in which final rates have not been agreed to, the difference between the ODS accruals based on billing rates established by MARAD and the ODS accruals based on the contractor's rates shall be disclosed in appropriate footnotes to the balance sheet and to the income statement.

              (i) Amounts representing gain or loss from extraordinary items, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles customarily applied in the industry of which the contractor is a part, shall be reported in this account. Generally, these transactions would be attributed to insurance proceeds from the total loss of a vessel or catastrophic losses to shore-based facilities, as well as from sales of damaged assets scrapped because of a natural catastrophe, and disposal of assets used primarily in a business segment which is being discontinued.
              (ii) Sufficient records shall be maintained to fully describe and account for all aspects of each item reported in this account, and when a firm commitment is made to dispose of an operating business segment, a provision for anticipated gain or loss to be realized in the subsequent period from disposal of assets and winding down of operations of the discontinued segment shall be taken into income in the year the contractor makes the decision.
              (iii) Amounts in this account must be net of all taxes including Federal income taxes.

              § 232.6
              Financial report filing requirement.
              (a) Reporting Frequency and Due Dates. The contractor shall file a semiannual financial report and an annual financial report, in the format referred to in § 232.1(a)(2), which MARAD shall make available to the contractor. This Form MA-172 (Revised) shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and modified to the extent necessary to comply with this regulation. The annual financial report shall be reconciled to the financial statements audited by independent certified public accountants (CPAs) licensed to practice by a state or other political subdivision of the United States, or licensed public accountants licensed to practice by regulatory authority or other political subdivision of the United States on or before December 31, 1970. Both the annual and semiannual financial reports shall be due within 120 days after the close of the contractor's annual or semiannual accounting period. If certified (CPA) statements are not available when required, company certified statements are to be submitted within the due dates, and the CPA statements shall be submitted as soon as available. The respondent may, in place of any Schedule(s) contained in the Form MA-172, submit a schedule or schedules from its audited financial statements, or a computer print-out or schedule, consistent with the instructions provided in the MARAD formats. MARAD will accept electronic options (such as facsimile and Internet) for transmission of required information to MARAD, if practicable.
              (b) Certification. Annual and semiannual reports shall be approved by the Respondent and Official of Respondent whom MARAD may contact regarding the report in the reporting formats prescribed as the MA-172 submission.
              (c) Presumption of confidentiality. MARAD will initially presume that each part of the financial reports or data submitted as prescribed by this Regulation, other than Schedule 101—Identity of Respondent and Schedules 102 and 103, only with respect to the names and titles of directors and principal officers and employees, is privileged or confidential within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). In the event of a subsequent request for any portion of the reports or data under 5 U.S.C. 552, the submitter will be notified of such request and given the opportunity to comment. The contractor shall claim confidentiality at that time by memorandum or letter stating the basis, in detail, for such assertion of exemption, including but not limited to statutory and decisional authorities. Those parts not so claimed by the submitter to be confidential will be disclosed, and those parts so claimed will be subject to initial determination by the Freedom of Information Act Officer.

            Sec. 204(b), 1109, Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1114(b), 1279b); 49 CFR 1.66.
          
          
            Source:
            53 FR 23119, June 20, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
          
          
            § 249.1
            Purpose.
            This part prescribes certain regulations governing the placement of marine hull insurance on vessels built or operated with subsidy or covered by vessel obligation guarantees issued pursuant to Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (Act). (46 U.S.C. 1271-1279)
          
          
            § 249.2
            Policy.
            (a) It is the policy of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) that companies subject to requirements for the placement of marine hull insurance shall be afforded the widest possible opportunity to obtain the necessary coverage, with minimal regulatory constraints, with financially sound underwriters, and that such placement should not create any unnecessary impediments to competitive maritime operations.
            (b) It is also the policy of MARAD to require owners of vessels with ODS or Title XI obligation guarantees to allow the American marine insurance market the opportunity to compete for the marine hull insurance on their vessels before such insurance is placed. Consistent with sound business judgment, owners will be expected to place their insurance with the American market to the maximum extent possible when the rates, terms and conditions offered by American underwriters are competitive with those offered by foreign underwriters.
          
          
            § 249.3
            Amounts of insurance.
            MARAD will inform the owner of each vessel that is subsidized or covered by vessel obligation guarantees, prior to initial placement and at least annually thereafter, of the minimum amount of insurance required to be placed on the vessel.
          
          
            § 249.4
            Eligibility.
            
              In General. All required marine hull insurance must be placed with:
            (a) Underwriters licensed to do business in one or more of the United States;
            (b) Underwriters at Lloyds;
            (c) Member companies of the Institute of London Underwriters; or
            (d) Other underwriters specifically approved in advance by the Maritime Administration.
          
          
            § 249.5
            Eligibility criteria.
            (a) U.S. Underwriters. Underwriters licensed to do business in a state are eligible to participate without further consideration, provided they have at least a B security rating, as published in the latest edition of A.M. Best's Insurance Reports, and the amount of insurance does not exceed the limitation on risk prescribed in § 249.8.
            (b) Foreign Underwriters. (1) Underwriters at Lloyds are eligible to participate without further consideration.

            (2) Underwriters which are members of the Institute of London Underwriters (ILU) (i.e., member companies, not parents or affiliates of the member companies) are eligible to participate without further consideration, provided that the ILU member company actually underwriting the risk maintains a trust fund in the United States for the benefit of its U.S. policyholders in an amount at least equal to the minimum provided in § 249.7(d), and the amount insured does not exceed the limitation on risk prescribed in § 249.8. Parent companies or affiliates of the ILU member companies are treated as other foreign underwriters under subsection (c) of this section.
            MARAD reserves the right to review this eligibility at any time.
            (c) Other Foreign Underwriters. Foreign underwriters, other than those specified in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, may also be eligible to participate in the writing of marine hull insurance on MARAD program vessels, if approved to do so in accordance with the procedures contained in §§ 249.6 and 249.7.
            (d) Documentation of eligibility. It shall be the responsibility of the vessel owner and its broker to ensure that the requirements of this section are met, and they should be able to provide MARAD, upon request, with documentation to that effect.
          
          
            § 249.6
            Application procedures.
            (a) MARAD may grant specific approval for underwriters described in § 249.5(c) to participate in the writing of marine hull insurance on MARAD program vessels, only in advance of any actual placement.
            (b) Only those foreign underwriters who have obtained a high rating (A or comparable) from an accepted international rating service may apply, and if approved, such approval will be contingent upon continued maintenance of such rating. MARAD will make available to interested parties the names of any accepted international rating service.
            (c) To seek approval, an applicant shall submit to MARAD:
            (1) Certified financial data for the five previous years in sufficient detail to enable MARAD to assess the financial strength and solvency of the applicant. Normally, this would be the same data which the underwriter must submit to the regulatory agency in its country of domicile. However, MARAD may request additional data if the applicant's submissions are considered inadequate;
            (2) A comprehensive description and English language version of the insurance regulatory regime that is in place in the insurer's country of domicile. (After review, MARAD may contact the foreign national regulatory authorities, as appropriate);
            (3) An affidavit in writing, executed by an agent of the applicant who is a domiciliary of the United States, and supported by appropriate documentation, to demonstrate that there is nothing in either law or practice to preclude a U.S. insurer from obtaining the same access to the applicant's home market as the applicant is seeking to the U.S. market, and
            (4) The details of its reinsurance program, if it wishes to write any risks in excess of five percent of its policyholders' surplus. These details shall be accompanied by a statement that clearly demonstrates the special circumstances and good cause by which MARAD should be persuaded to modify its general policy on limitation of risk described in § 249.8.
          
          
            § 249.7
            Approval.
            (a) Approval of the applicant will be based upon an assessment of the applicant's financial condition and solvency, its rating by an accepted international rating service, suitability of the regulatory regime under which the applicant must operate in its home country, and on the principle of reciprocal non-discrimination. MARAD will not approve access to the U.S. hull insurance market, if U.S. insurers are denied similar access to the hull insurance market in the applicant's home country.
            (b) MARAD will publish in the Federal Register each Notice of Application received from foreign underwriters described in § 249.5(c), affording interested persons an opportunity to bring to MARAD's attention any discriminatory laws or practices relating to the placement of marine hull insurance which might exist in the applicant's country of domicile.
            (c) In granting approval, MARAD will consider all materials available to it, and may impose reasonable terms and conditions upon any such approvals granted.

            (d) Upon approval, applicant will be required to establish and maintain for the benefit of its U.S. policyholders a U.S. trust fund in the amount of at least $1.5 million, such amount to be reviewed periodically (but not more frequently than annually), and adjusted as appropriate. This requirement may be satisfied by means of an appropriate irrevocable letter of credit.
            (e) All policies, at the time of issuance, shall contain the latest American Institute of Marine Underwriters' forms, or equivalent, as approved by MARAD.
            (f) All policies issued by foreign underwriters shall include New York Suable Clause or Service of Suit (USA) Clause.
            (g)(1) To maintain approval, foreign underwriters, other than those specified in § 249.5(b), shall, in addition to retaining the high rating from an accepted international rating service, file annual financial statements in the same level of detail as required for original approval. Such statements shall be due within 120 days after the close of the underwriter's annual accounting period.
            (2) In addition, a new affidavit concerning the lack of discriminatory laws or practices related to hull insurance in the underwriter's home market, as described in § 249.6(c)(3), shall be filed annually at the same time as the financial statements.
            (h) Since there is no annual reapproval required, foreign underwriters which are approved shall agree to submit additional information, as requested by MARAD, if it has reason to believe there has been a change in the underwriter's financial status or business practices which could affect the quality of its security. Failure to provide such information on a timely basis could result in immediate withdrawal of the authorization to write hull insurance on MARAD program vessels.
          
          
            § 249.8
            Limitation on risk.

            (a) Underwriters may take a line on any single risk in excess of five percent of its Policyholders' Surplus only with the prior approval of MARAD. MARAD will grant such approval to certain underwriters only in special circumstances, and for good cause shown. The standard to be applied in such cases shall be that the underwriter's net retention on any single risk may not exceed five percent of its Policyholders' Surplus, the gross amount of the risk may not exceed its surplus, and the reinsurers must have a high (A or comparable) rating from an accepted international rating service.
            (b) The vessel owner shall also provide MARAD with a mortgagee's interest policy in an amount equal to the difference between the net retention and the amount of the line taken by such underwriter.
          
          
            § 249.9
            American market participation.
            (a) Owners of vessels receiving ODS or Title XI vessel obligation guarantees, or their brokers, shall offer to the American marine insurance market the opportunity to compete for the placement of marine hull insurance on each vessel. Consistent with sound business judgment, owners will be expected to place their insurance with the American market to the maximum extent possible when the rates, terms and conditions offered by American underwriters are competitive with those offered by foreign underwriters. MARAD will make available a list of approved American underwriters and their capacities.
            (b) In the event that less than 50 percent of the placement is made with the American marine insurance market, the owners, or their brokers, shall file an affidavit confirming that the risk has been offered to a substantial portion of the American market. The affidavit shall list the American underwriters to which the risk was offered, and such underwriters shall account for at least 50 percent of the approved American market capacity, or 75 percent in the event that more than 75 percent of the risk was placed in foreign markets.
            (c) Failure to comply with (a) or (b), above, may result in MARAD requiring that the risk be reoffered and that the existing placement be modified, as deemed appropriate.
          
          
            § 249.10
            Non-discrimination policy.

            To administer effectively the policy regarding non-discrimination against U.S. insurers in other countries, as described in §§ 249.6(b)(3) and 249.7(a), MARAD seeks the assistance of the American marine insurance industry to provide information at the time of publication of Notice of Application described in § 249.7(b) concerning the existence of any discriminatory laws or practices in the marine hull insurance market abroad. Upon receipt of such information, MARAD will take whatever action it deems appropriate.
          
          
            § 249.11
            Confidentiality.
            (a) If the data submitted under this rule contain information that the submitter considers to be commercial or financial information and privileged or confidential, or otherwise exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), the submitter shall assert a claim of exemption at the time the data are submitted. The claim shall be made in a letter contained in a sealed enveloped marked “Confidential Information,” addressed to the Secretary, Maritime Administration. The submitter shall stamp or mark “confidential” on the top of each page containing information claimed to be confidential.
            (b) In claiming an exemption under FOIA, the submitter must state the basis for such action, including supporting information showing: (1) That the information claimed to be confidential is a trade secret or commercial or financial information in accordance with statutory and decisional authority; and (2) that measures have been taken by the submitter of the information to ensure that the information has not been disclosed or otherwise made available to the public, or, if the information has been disclosed or otherwise becomes available to the public, why such disclosure or availability does not compromise the confidential nature of the information.
            (c) In the event of a subsequent request for any portion of the data under the FOIA, those submissions not so claimed by the submitter will be disclosed, and those so claimed will be subject to the initial determination by the Secretary, Maritime Administration.
            (d) If the Secretary makes a determination unfavorable to the submitter, the submitter will be advised that MARAD will not honor the request for confidentiality at the time of any request for production of information under the FOIA by third parties.

              § 272.24
              Subsidy repair summaries.
              (a) Filing requirements. The Operator of an Eligible Vessel shall submit to the appropriate MARAD regional Ship Operations Office a Subsidy Repair Summary (Form MA-140) for each quarter of a calendar year in which one or more of the Operator's Eligible Vessels (including any vessel which has been temporarily withdrawn from subsidized service) terminates a voyage. This quarterly report shall include supporting documents and information, as described in paragraph (c) of this section. This summary may be for either a single voyage or multiple voyages, and shall be filed not later than 120 days after:
              (1) The close of the calendar quarter in which a voyage is terminated, or
              (2) The date the reported vessel is temporarily or permanently withdrawn from subsidized service.
              (b) Form requirements. MARAD will make available one copy of Form MA-140 upon request. Each Operator shall furnish its own supply of the form and prepare each form for submission. Information on any Form MA-140 shall pertain to only one vessel. The Operator's superintendent engineer or other responsible official shall certify every summary submitted by an Operator in the following manner:
              
              

                This is to certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, and based on recorded entries through (Date), this is a true and correct statement of repair and maintenance expenditures for the period stated, and that the repair and maintenance items indicated as eligible for subsidy participation are reasonably attributable to service subsequent to commencement of the first voyage under the Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreement and were necessary, satisfactorily completed, and the price is fair and reasonable (exceptions are listed on separate page).
              
              
              (c) Categorization. The Operator shall exercise due diligence in identifying each item in the Form MA-140 within the following three separate categories:
              (1) Claimed for subsidy. This includes the following:
              (i) M&R
              (ii) Spare Parts
              (iii) Improvements
              (2) Marine loss. If any M&R expense is incurred because of marine loss, the Operator shall list such an M&R expense under this separate category, and shall exclude such expense from the totals for the “Claimed for Subsidy” and “Non-Subsidized Items” categories provided for in this section.
              (3) Non-subsidized items. This category shall include builders' guarantee items, foreign repairs, and other items of M&R expense not claimed for subsidy.
              (d) Required supporting documents and information—(1) General. The Operator shall support every item in the Form MA-140 with documents or other information, in sufficient detail to permit MARAD to determine the fairness and reasonableness of the prices for the submitted work. With respect to any claims for M&R performed outside the United States, the Operator shall submit with the claim a certificate, signed either by the Operator (if it uses its own shore gang labor or materials from its own inventory) or by an official of the ship repair yard or the independent contractor performing the work, stating that the M&R were performed with materials, labor, or both, of Domestic Origin.
              (2) U.S. Independent contractors. If a U.S. independent contractor performed M&R work, the Operator shall support each such expense with one copy of the contractor's invoices covering the work performed. If an invoice is not itemized and fully descriptive of the work performed with item prices then the Operator shall attach to the contractor's invoice other supporting documentation, such as specifications, prepared in sufficient detail to permit a determination of the fairness and reasonableness of the prices for each segment of the work performed.
              (3) Operator's shore gang. If an Operator's own U.S. shore gang has performed any M&R work, the Operator shall submit with the Form MA-140 specifications covering that work, prepared in sufficient detail (including the material and labor cost of each item) to permit a determination of the specific cost of each segment of work performed.
              (4) Operator furnished material. Whenever an Operator furnishes to a contractor material obtained either from the Operator's own ship stores or shoreside inventory, or by direct purchase for a specific job, the Operator shall include on the invoice, requisition form or other form of transfer memorandum the item number for which the material was used and the contract number covering the work performed.
              (5) Spare parts. The Operator shall ensure that the invoice covering any Spare Part for an Eligible Vessel which is to be used or installed as an integral, permanent part of the vessel, indicates the specific piece or part of the vessel's hull, machinery, or Equipment for which the Spare Part was obtained.
              (6) Foreign repairs. Operators receiving M&R subsidy shall submit copies of all U.S. Customs entry forms detailing foreign expenditures on behalf of Eligible Vessels. The copies shall include all expenditures made during the quarter.
              (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2133-0007)
            
            
              § 272.25
              Requirements for subsidy repayment.
              (a) Repayment of M&R subsidy for compensated marine or other loss. If an Operator eventually receives compensation from an insurer or any other person for a marine loss or any other loss for which M&R subsidy has been paid, the Operator shall repay to MARAD an amount equal to the amount of subsidy paid with respect to that loss.
              (b) Repayment of M&R subsidy for Improvements—three year service requirement. If, within three years after the completion of an Improvement for which M&R subsidy was paid, the Operator permanently withdraws the Eligible Vessel from the ODSA, the Operator shall repay to MARAD an amount equal to the amount of M&R subsidy paid with respect to that Improvement unless MARAD shall have determined that such action was beyond the control of the Operator.
              (c) Repayment of M&R subsidy due to allocation of costs. If the allocation of total M&R costs required by § 272.41(e) of this part results in the allocation of a lesser amount of subsidizable M&R costs than were actually paid for during the calendar year, the Operator shall repay to MARAD the amount of ODS which was paid in excess of the allocated subsidizable costs.
              (d) Administrative action. If an Operator fails to repay an M&R subsidy required to be repaid by this section, MARAD may either reduce any ODS payable by the amount of M&R subsidy required to be repaid by this section, or take any other action necessary to secure repayment.
            
          
          
            Subpart D—Penalties
            
              § 272.31
              Determination of penalty.
              Operators whose Eligible Vessels have undergone foreign repairs, which MARAD determines are non-emergency in nature, may be subject to a penalty in an amount equal to the total cost (exclusive of applicable U.S. Customs duties) of such foreign repairs and purchases, such penalty to be effected by a deduction from the Operator's total ODS otherwise accrued. The Director, Office of Ship Operating Assistance, shall notify the Operator by letter with respect to:
              (a) MARAD's determination of a penalty and the reasons therefore; and
              (b) Whether the determination is final or subject to the submission of additional information.
            
            
              § 272.32
              Mitigation of penalty.
              The Director, Office of Ship Operating Assistance, may decide, after a non-emergency foreign repair occurs, to mitigate the penalty. Any mitigation of penalty shall be based on a determination that special circumstances existed at the time of repair. The Director shall not consider the difference in the price of foreign and domestic repair work in making this determination, and shall not grant prior approval of foreign repairs. In determining whether special circumstances existed, the Director shall consider, among others, the following factors:
              (a) The trading area of the vessel both before and after the repair was performed;
              (b) Loss of revenue and effect on vessel utilization if the vessel had returned to the United States for repairs;
              (c) The additional operating expense which would have resulted from a return to the United States to repair the vessel; and

              (d) Whether the repairs could have been deferred until return to the United States, taking into consideration the Coast Guard requirements for dry docking and special surveys.
            
            
              § 272.33
              Appeals.
              The Operator may appeal final penalty determinations of the Director, Office of Ship Operating Assistance, to the Board, as provided in § 272.43(c) of this part.
            
          
          
            Subpart E—Examination, Audit, Review and Appeal Procedures
            
              § 272.41
              Requirements for examination and allocation of M&R expenses.
              (a) Examination requirement. Pursuant to the specific limitations on M&R subsidy in section 603 of the Act, the Region Office shall examine the expenses submitted by an operator on Form MA-140 in order to determine eligibility to receive M&R subsidy and the reasonableness of such expenses.
              (b) Operator's responsibility. During the examination, the operator shall provide, at the request of the Director or other official of the Region Office, any further documentation or information necessary to support an M&R expense. If such documentation or information, including information required under paragraph (e) of this section, is not received at the Region Office on a timely basis, the Director or other official of the Region Office may disallow the M&R expense.
              (c) Notification of examination results. At the completion of the examination the Director or other appropriate official of the applicable Region Office shall notify the Operator by letter of the results of the examination, and shall state the reason for each disallowance of an item claimed for subsidy and/or each nonapproval of a marine loss item.
              (d) Record retention requirements. To facilitate an audit examination of M&R made pursuant to § 272.42 of this part, the Operator shall maintain files arranged by vessel and voyage, which shall include, at a minimum, a copy of the Region Office notice letter, a copy of the Form MA-140 with all supporting documents submitted therewith, and the condition survey report. The Operator shall retain all the required materials in files for not less than 3 years after completion of the audit.
              (1) Limitation on approval. Any approval for payment of M&R subsidy for a marine loss item shall be subject to rescission or modification if the Operator subsequently receives insurance or other compensation for the item. The Region Finance Officer may at any time request verification that the Operator has not received such compensation.
              (2) Status report on approved marine loss items. The Operator shall advise the Region Finance Office by letter as to whether insurance or other compensation will be recovered for the marine loss item. The Operator is responsible for ensuring that the letter reaches the applicable Region Office within 120 days after:
              (i) The date on which all repairs for damage attributed to the “Policy Voyage” (as defined in the Operator's insurance policy) are completed, when the amount for such repairs does not exceed the franchise or deductible of the policy, or
              (ii) The date of the underwriter's rejection of the Operator's marine loss insurance claim or claims.
              (Reporting and recordkeeping requirements contained in paragraph (d) introductory text were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2133-0007)

              § 272.42
              Audit requirements and procedures.
              (a) Required audit. In connection with the audit of the Operator's subsidizable expenses, the Office of the Inspector General, Department of Transportation, shall audit for MARAD the Operator's M&R costs, as necessary, for the determination of final subsidy rates. The Operator shall substantiate those costs recorded on the books of account which have been approved by the Administration.
              (b) Notification of audit results. Upon completion of the audit by the Office of Inspector General, the MARAD Office of Financial Approvals shall notify the Operator of the audit results, including any items disallowed and the reasons for such disallowance.

              Review and appeal procedures.
              (a) Exclusive procedures. Notwithstanding the audit appeal procedures of part 205 of this chapter, the provisions of this section shall be the exclusive remedy available to an Operator for the review and appeal of any disallowance of subsidy for a M&R expense claimed or any penalty assessed pursuant to § 272.31.
              (b) Request for review. An Operator may request review by:
              (1) The Director, Office of Ship Operations, with respect to any disallowance by the Region office of a claimed M&R expense, after receiving the notification required by § 272.41(c); or
              (2) The Director, Office of Financial Approvals, with respect to any disallowance of a claimed M&R expense, after receiving the notification required by § 272.42(b).
              (c) Timeliness of request. The Operator shall file all requests for review pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section within 60 days after the date of the audit notification. Any disallowance with respect to which the Operator fails to file a timely request for review shall be final and shall not be subject to appeal to the Board pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
              (d) Notification of review determination. The appropriate MARAD Office Director shall notify the Operator by letter, with respect to each timely filed review request, of the Director's determination and the reasons for each disallowance and whether the determination is final or subject to the submission of additional information.
              (e) Appeal to the Maritime Subsidy Board—(1) Right to appeal. An Operator may appeal a MARAD Office Director's final determination issued pursuant to § 272.32 (penalties) or § 272.43 (review of claims disallowance or of audit results) of this section to the Board in writing.
              (2) Contents and timeliness. The Operator shall set forth in any appeal the reasons for the Operator's objection to a penalty or disallowance of M&R subsidy and shall file such appeal with the Secretary of the Board within 60 days after the date of the notification sent to the operator by the appropriate Director pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section or § 272.33.
            
            
              § 272.44

It also permits the accumulation of the proceeds of such sales or indemnification and of certain earnings without liability under part I (section 531 and following), subchapter G, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and the regulations thereunder (26 CFR 1.531 through 1.537-1 (Income Tax Regulations)).
            (c) Availability of benefits. The benefits of section 511 of the Act are available to any citizen as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of § 287.1, who, during any taxable year owns, in whole or in part, a vessel or vessels within the scope of § 287.3. A citizen operating such a vessel or vessels owned by any other person or persons can derive no benefit from the provisions relating to the nonrecognition of gain from the sale or loss of such vessel or vessels so owned, but may establish a construction reserve fund in which he may deposit earnings from the operation of such vessel or vessels.
            (d) Applicability of section 511. Section 511 of the Act applies only with respect to sales or losses of vessels within the scope of § 287.3 or in respect of earnings derived from the operation of such vessels. A loss to be within section 511 of the Act must be an actual or constructive total loss. Whether there is a total loss, actual or constructive, will be determined by the Administration.
          
          
            § 287.3
            Requirements as to vessel operations.
            Section 511 of the Act applies with respect to vessels operated in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States or in the fisheries of the United States and vessels acquired or being constructed for the purpose of such operation. The foreign commerce of the United States includes commerce or trade between the United States (including the District of Columbia), the territories and possessions which are embraced within the coastwise laws, and a foreign country or other territories and possessions of the United States. The domestic commerce of the United States includes commerce or trade between ports of the United States and its territories and possessions, embraced within the coastwise laws and on inland rivers. The fisheries include the fisheries of the United States and its territories and possessions. Section 511 of the Act does not apply to vessels operated in the foreign commerce or fisheries of any country other than the United States.
          
          
            § 287.4
            Application to establish fund.
            (a) Any person claiming to be entitled to the benefits of section 511 of the Act may make application, in writing, to the Administration for permission to establish a construction reserve fund.

            [G.O. 38, 2d Rev., 30 FR 7215, May 29, 1965, as amended by Amdt. 1, 31 FR 3397, Mar. 4, 1966; 47 FR 25530, June 14, 1982; 68 FR 62537, Nov. 5, 2003; 69 FR 61451, Oct. 19, 2004]
          
          
            § 287.5
            Tentative authorization to establish fund.
            Where the time between the receipt by the Administration of the application for permission to establish a construction reserve fund and the date prior to which an amount received from the sale or loss of a vessel must be deposited to come within the scope of section 511 of the Act is insufficient to permit a determination of the eligibility of the applicant, the Administration may tentatively authorize the establishment of a construction reserve fund and the deposit of such amount therein. Such tentative authorization shall be subject to rescission by the Administration if subsequently it is determined that the applicant is not entitled to the benefits of section 511 of the Act, or has not complied with the statutory requirements. For example, a tentative authorization will be rescinded if the Administration ascertains that the applicant is not a citizen. Upon such determination, the fund shall be closed and all amounts on deposit therein shall be withdrawn.
          
          
            § 287.6
            Establishment of fund.
            (a) Authorization by the Administration. If the application is approved by the Administration, the Administration will adopt Orders authorizing the establishment of a construction reserve fund with the depository or depositories designated by the taxpayer and approved by the Administration. The Orders will provide for joint control by the Administration and the taxpayer over such fund, will set forth the conditions governing the establishment and maintenance of the fund and the making of deposits therein and withdrawals therefrom, and will designate the representatives authorized to execute instruments of withdrawal on behalf of the Administration.
            (b) Resolution or agreement of the taxpayer. A certified copy of the Orders of the Administration will be furnished the taxpayer. If the taxpayer is a corporation, it shall promptly adopt, through its board of directors, a resolution satisfactory in form and substance to the Administration, authorizing the establishment and maintenance of the fund in conformity with the action of the Administration. If the taxpayer is not a corporation, it shall promptly execute an agreement with the depository satisfactory in form and substance to the Administration to conform to the action of the Administration as set forth in the Orders. Certified copies of the Orders of the Administration and of the resolution of the taxpayer (if it is a corporation) will be furnished to the depository by the Administration and the taxpayer, respectively, for its guidance in maintaining the fund and honoring instruments of withdrawal. The taxpayer, if a corporation, shall also furnish the Administration with a certified copy of its resolution, or if not a corporation a duplicate original of its agreement with the depository.
            
            
              Note:
              The resolutions referred to in this section shall be retained 2 years after a final release or settlement agreement is completed between the Maritime Administration/Maritime Subsidy Board and the taxpayer.
            
            
            (c) Constructive action not recognized. Constructive deposits, substitutions or withdrawals will not be recognized by the Administration in the establishment and maintenance of the fund.
            (d) Failure to make deposits as basis for termination of fund. In the event no deposit is made into the fund for more than five years, any amounts remaining in the fund shall be removed from the fund at the discretion of the Administration and, if so removed, the fund shall be terminated. In the event of such termination, see § 287.23 for recognition of gain.
          
          
            § 287.7
            Circumstances permitting reimbursement from a construction reserve fund.
            (a) Payments prior to establishment of fund. If, prior to the establishment of a construction reserve fund under the regulations in this part, a taxpayer has made necessary payments under a contract which satisfies the provisions of the regulations in this part and section 511 of the Act for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel, such taxpayer may, if subsequently authorized to establish a construction reserve fund under the regulations in this part, draw against such fund as reimbursement for the amount, if any, of other funds which, with the approval or ratification of the Administration, the taxpayer used for making such necessary payments prior to the establishment of the fund.
            (b) Payments subsequent to establishment of fund. If, subsequent to the establishment of a construction reserve fund under the regulations in this part, the taxpayer has made necessary payments under a contract which satisfies the provisions of the regulations in this part and section 511 of the Act for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel, such taxpayer may draw against such fund as reimbursement for the amount, if any, of other funds which, with the approval or ratification of the Administration, the taxpayer had used for the purpose of making such necessary payments.
          
          
            § 287.8
            Investment of funds in securities.
            (a) Obligations of or guaranteed by the United States. Interest-bearing direct obligations of the United States, or obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States may be deposited in the construction reserve fund in lieu of cash, may be purchased with cash on deposit in the fund, or may be substituted for securities or commitment to finance in the fund, subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
            (b) Other securities. In cases where the taxpayer desires to deposit any securities in the fund in lieu of cash other than those of or guaranteed by the United States or to purchase such other securities with cash on deposit in the fund, or to substitute such other securities for securities or commitment to finance in the fund, the taxpayer shall make written application to the Administration and shall not consummate the transaction until the written consent of the Administration shall have been received. The application shall describe the securities fully. Every approval by the Administration of such application shall be conditioned upon agreement by the taxpayer forthwith to dispose of such securities upon subsequent request by the Administration. Immediately upon the purchase of any securities for deposit in the fund, the taxpayer shall advise the Administration, giving the date of purchase, a description of the securities, and the price paid therefor (net, brokerage and other charges, and gross). Ordinarily, the Administration will not approve the deposit in the fund in lieu of cash, or the purchase with cash on deposit in the fund or the substitution for securities in the fund of securities not actively traded in on exchanges registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. Chapter 2B), or securities which are not legal for investment of trust funds. Whenever the Administration approves the substitution of other securities for securities in the fund, such substitution shall be effected only upon or after the deposit of the substituted securities into the fund.
            (c) Cash. Cash may be substituted for amounts which are on deposit in the fund in any other form.
            (d) Devalued securities. In the event the Administration determines that the market value at any date of any securities in the fund has decreased to a figure which is less than 90 percent of the market value at the time of deposit into the fund, then within 60 days after the taxpayer receives notice of such determination the taxpayer shall (except as otherwise provided in this paragraph) deposit into the fund cash or securities in an amount equal to the difference between the current market value of the devalued securities and the market value of such securities at the time of their original deposit. However, if any securities in the fund are valued at the time of their deposit at less than the market value of such securities at the time of their deposit the taxpayer shall be required to deposit only an amount equal to that portion of the difference between the current market value of the devalued securities and the market value of such securities at the time of their original deposit which bears the same ratio to such total difference as the amount at which the securities were valued at the time of their deposit bears to the market value at the time of such deposit.
          
          
            § 287.9
            Valuation of securities in fund.
            (a) Equipment values. In cases where securities are deposited in the fund in lieu of cash, or are purchased with cash on deposit in the fund, or are substituted for securities in the fund, the value of such securities must not be less than the amount of cash in lieu of which they are so deposited or with which they are so purchased, or the value at the time of deposit of the securities for which they were so substituted. If the securities on deposit in the fund are replaced by cash from the general funds of the taxpayer, the amount of cash to be deposited in the fund in lieu thereof shall be not less than the amount at which such securities were valued at the time of their deposit in the fund.
            (b) Determination of value. (1) For the purpose of determining the amount in the fund, the value of securities shall be their “market value” (which shall be the basis for determining value, unless otherwise agreed to by the administration) and shall be determined in the following manner:
            (i) In instances where no actual purchase is involved, such as the initial deposit of securities in the fund in lieu of cash, the last sales price thereof on the principal exchange on the day the deposit was made shall be deemed to be the “market value” thereof, or, if no such sales were made, the “market value” thereof will be determined by the Administration on such basis as it may deem to be fair and reasonable in each case.

            (ii) In instances where the purchase of securities with cash on deposit in the fund is involved, “market value” shall be the gross price paid (adjusted for accrued interest); Provided, That if such securities are purchased otherwise than upon a registered exchange the price shall be within the range of transactions on the exchange on the date of such purchase, or, if there were no such transactions, then the “market value” thereof will be determined by the Administration on such basis as it may deem to be fair and reasonable in each case.
            (2) Purchase-money obligations secured by mortgages on vessels sold or irrevocable commitments to finance the construction or acquisition of new vessels which are deposited in the construction reserve fund as provided in § 287.13 ordinarily will be considered as equivalent to their face value.
          
          
            § 287.10
            Withdrawals from fund.
            (a) Withdrawals for obligations or liquidation. (1) Checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal to meet obligations under a contract for the construction or acquisition of new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness, after having been executed by the taxpayer, shall be forwarded to the Administration in Washington, DC, with appropriate explanation of the purpose of the proposed withdrawal, including properly certified invoices or other supporting papers. Such instruments of withdrawal, if payable to the Administration, will be deposited by the Administration for collection, and the proceeds thereof, upon collection, will be credited to the appropriate contract with the Administration; but if drawn to the order of payees other than the Administration, after countersignature on behalf of the Administration, will ordinarily be forwarded to the payees.
            (2) An amount obligated under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness, whether the obligor has the entire or a partial interest therein within the scope of section 511 of the Act, may not, so long as the contract or indebtedness continues in full force and effect, be withdrawn except to meet payments due or to become due under such contract or for such liquidation.
            (b) Other withdrawals. Checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal executed by the taxpayer for purposes other than to meet obligations under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness, whether the taxpayer has the entire or a partial interest therein, shall be drawn by the taxpayer to its own order and forwarded to the Administration in Washington, DC, with appropriate explanation of the purpose of the proposed withdrawal. Such withdrawals may occur by reason of a determination by the Administration that the taxpayer is not entitled to the benefits of section 511 of the Act (see § 287.5), or that a particular deposit has been improperly made (see § 287.13), or by reason of the election of the taxpayer to make such withdrawals. Upon receipt of such checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal, the Administration will give notice thereof to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The Commissioner will advise the Administration of the receipt of the notice and the date it was received. The Administration shall not countersign such checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal or transmit them to the taxpayer until the expiration of 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice by the Commissioner, unless the Commissioner or such official of the Internal Revenue Service as he may designate for the purpose consents in writing to earlier countersignature by the Administration and transmittal to the taxpayer. Upon the expiration of such 30-day period, or prior thereto if the aforesaid consent of the Commissioner has been obtained, the Administration will countersign the check, draft, or other instrument of withdrawal and forward it to the taxpayer.
            (c) Inapplicability to certain transactions. The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to transactions deemed to be withdrawals by reason of the sale of securities held in the fund for an amount less than the market value thereof at the time of their deposit (see § 287.23), nor to the cancellation of an irrevocable commitment deposited in the fund, upon proof satisfactory to the Administration that the terms of such commitment have been fully satisfied.
          
          
            § 287.11
            Time deposits.
            Deposits in the construction reserve fund not invested in securities may be placed in time deposits when, in the judgment of the taxpayer, it is desirable and feasible so to do. The taxpayer shall promptly advise the Administration of any time deposit arrangements made with the depository. The Administration reserves the right at any time to require the termination or modification of any such arrangements. With prior approval of the Administration a time deposit may be made in a depository other than the one with which the construction reserve fund is established.
          
          
            § 287.12
            Election as to nonrecognition of gain.
            (a) Election requirements. As a prerequisite to the nonrecognition of gain on the sale or loss of a vessel (or of a part interest therein) for Federal income tax purposes, the taxpayer, after establishing a construction reserve fund, must make an election with respect to such vessel or interest in the manner set forth in this paragraph.
            (1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the election must be made in the taxpayer's Federal income tax return (or, in the case of a partnership, in the partnership return of income) for the taxable year in which the gain with respect to the sale or loss of the vessel is realized. The election as to the nonrecognition of gain shall be shown by a statement to that effect, submitted as a part of, and attached to, the return. The statement, which need not be on any prescribed form, shall set forth a computation of the amount of the realized gain, the identity of the vessel, the nature and extent of the taxpayer's interest therein, whether such vessel was sold or lost and the date of sale or loss, the full sale price or full amount of indemnity, and the amount and date of each payment thereof, the basis of tax purposes and any other data affecting the determination of the realized gain.
            (2) Certain Government payments. In case a vessel is purchased or requisitioned by the United States, or is lost, in any taxable year and the taxpayer receives payment for the vessel so purchased or requisitioned, or receives from the United States indemnity on account of such loss, subsequent to the end of such taxable year, the taxpayer shall make his election by filing notice thereof with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC, 20224, prior to the expiration of 60 days after receipt of the payment or indemnity. The taxpayer shall file a copy of the notice with the Secretary, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC, 20590. The form of the notice of election shall be prepared by the taxpayer and shall be substantially as follows:
            

              Election Relative to Nonrecognition of Gain Under Section 511(c)(2), Merchant Marine Act, 1936

              Pursuant to the provisions of section 511(c)(2) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, notice is hereby given that the undersigned taxpayer elects that gain in respect of the sale to the United States, or indemnification received from the United States on account of the loss, of the vessel named below or share therein shall not be recognized. The circumstances involved in the computation of such gain are as follows:
              
              Name and other identification of vessel
              
              Nature and extent of the taxpayer's interest in the vessel

              Date of disposition
              
              Full sale price or full amount of indemnity received by taxpayer
              
              Amount and date of each payment of sale price or indemnity received by taxpayer
              
              Amount and date of each previous deposit of such payments in construction reserve fund
              
              Identification of each check or other instrument by which payment made to taxpayer
              
              Tax basis of taxpayer's interest in vessel
              
              Any other data affecting the determination of the realized gain
              
              Amount of gain (submit computation)
              
                   
              (Name of taxpayer)
                   By
              
              (Date of execution)
            
          
          
            § 287.13
            Deposit of proceeds of sales or indemnities.
            (a) Manner of deposit. The deposit required by section 511 of the Act must be made in a construction reserve fund established with a depository or depositories approved by the Administration and subject to the joint control of the Administration and the taxpayer. It is not necessary to establish a separate fund with respect to each vessel or share in a vessel sold or lost.
            (b) Amount of deposit. With respect to any vessel sold or lost, or a share therein, the deposit must be in an amount equal to the “net proceeds” of the sale, or the “net indemnity” for the loss. By “net proceeds” and “net indemnity” is meant (1) the depositor's interest in the adjusted basis of the vessel plus (2) the amount of gain which would be recognized for tax purposes in the absence of section 511 of the Act. In determining “net proceeds”, the amount necessarily paid or incurred for brokers' commissions is to be deducted from the gross amount of the sales price. In the event the taxpayer is an affiliate or associate of the buyer, the amount of the sales price shall not exceed the fair market value of the vessel or vessels sold as determined by the Administration. In such case the taxpayer shall furnish evidence sufficient, in the opinion of the Administration, to establish that the sales price is not in excess of the fair market value. In determining “net indemnity”, the amount necessarily paid or incurred purely for collection, or rate of exchange discounts on the payment, of the indemnity is to be deducted from the gross amount of collectible indemnity. In case of the sale or loss of several vessels or share therein, a deposit of the “net proceeds” or “net indemnity” with respect to one or more of the vessels or shares is permissible. Where several vessels or shares are sold for a lump sum, the “net proceeds” allocated to each vessel or share shall be determined in accordance with any reasonable rule satisfactory to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The taxpayer must deposit the full amount of each payment (including cash, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness) as a single deposit in the construction reserve fund. A payment divided between two or more depositories will be regarded as a single deposit. Amounts received by the taxpayer prior to the date of consummation of the sale of the vessel shall be considered as having been received by the taxpayer at the time the sale is consummated.
            (c) Purchase-money obligations. Where the proceeds from the sale of a vessel include purchase-money obligations, such obligations together with the entire collateral therefor, or, in the case of deposit of the proceeds of a share in the vessel, a proportionate part of the obligations and collateral as determined by the Administration, shall be deposited, with the remainder of the proceeds, in the construction reserve fund as a part of the “net proceeds”. The depository shall receive payment of all amounts due on such purchase-money obligations and such amounts shall be placed in the fund in substitution for the portion of the obligations paid. All installments of purchase-money obligations shall be paid directly into the fund by the obligor. In the event any such installment is not so deposited, the Administration, at any time after the due date, may require the taxpayer to deposit an amount equal to such installment. If the taxpayer so desires, he may deposit in the construction reserve fund cash or approved securities in an amount equal to the face value of any purchase-money obligations in lieu of depositing such obligations.
            (d) Vessel subject to mortgage at time of sale or loss. Where a vessel is subject to a mortgage or other encumbrance at the time of its sale or loss and the taxpayer actually receives only an amount representing the equity therein or a share in such equity corresponding to his share in the vessel, he shall deposit in the construction reserve fund such amount and concurrently therewith other funds in an amount equal to the difference between the amount received and the “net proceeds” or “net indemnity”. Such other funds may be in the form of cash, or, subject to the approval of the Administration, (1) interest-bearing securities, or (2) an irrevocable and unconditional commitment to finance the construction or acquisition of a new vessel in whole or in part by an obligor approved by the Administration in an amount equal to the amount by which the “net proceeds” exceed the cash or securities deposited in the fund.
            (e) Unauthorized deposits. A deposit which is not provided for by section 511 of the Act shall, without unreasonable delay, be withdrawn from the fund and tax liability will be determined as though such deposit had not been made. (See §§ 287.10 and 287.24.)
          
          
            § 287.14
            Deposit of earnings and receipts.
            (a) Earnings. A citizen may deposit all or any part of earnings derived from the operation, within the scope of § 287.3, of a vessel or vessels owned either by himself or any other person, if such earnings are intended for construction or acquisition of new vessels. Such earnings may include payments received by an owner, as compensation for use of his vessel, from other persons by whom it is so operated. Earnings from other sources may not be deposited. The earnings from operation of vessels which are eligible for deposit are the net earnings determined without regard to any deduction for depreciation, obsolescence, or amortization with respect to such vessels.
            (b) Receipts. Receipts from deposited funds, in the form of interest or otherwise, may be deposited.
          
          
            § 287.15
            Time for making deposits.
            (a) Proceeds of sale or indemnification. Deposits of amounts representing proceeds of the sale or indemnification for loss of a vessel or share therein must be made within 60 days after receipt by the taxpayer.
            (b) Earnings and receipts. Earnings and receipts for the taxable year may be deposited at any time. (See § 287.14.)
          
          
            § 287.16
            Tax liability as to earnings deposited.
            Deposit in the construction reserve fund of earnings from the operation of a vessel or vessels, or receipts, in the form of interest or otherwise, with respect to amounts previously deposited does not exempt the taxpayer from tax liability with respect thereto nor postpone the time such earnings or receipts are includible in gross income. Earnings and receipts deposited in a construction reserve fund established in accordance with the provisions of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part will be deemed to have been accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business within the meaning of part 1 (section 531 and following), subchapter G, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, so long as the requirements of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part are satisfied relative to the use of the fund in the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels. For incurrence of tax liability due to noncompliance with the requirements of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part with respect to deposits in the construction reserve fund, see the provisions of § 287.23.
          
          
            § 287.17
            Basis of new vessel.
            The basis for determining gain or loss and for depreciation for the purpose of the Federal income tax with respect to a new vessel constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned, or acquired by the taxpayer, or with respect to which purchase-money indebtedness is liquidated as provided in section 511(g) of the Act, with funds deposited in the construction reserve fund, is reduced by the amount of the unrecognized gain represented in the funds allocated under the provisions of the regulations in this part to the cost of such vessel. (See § 287.18.)
          
          
            § 287.18
            Allocation of gain for tax purposes.
            (a) General rules of allocation. As provided in § 287.17, if amounts on deposit in a construction reserve fund are expended, obligated, or withdrawn for construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness of such vessels, the portion thereof which represents gain shall be applied in reduction of the basis of such new vessels. The rules set forth below in this paragraph shall apply in allocating the unrecognized gain to the amounts so expended, obligated, or withdrawn:
            (1) If the “net proceeds” of a sale or “net indemnity” in respect of a loss are deposited in more than one deposit, the portion thereof representing unrecognized gain shall be considered as having been deposited first.
            (2) Amounts expended, obligated, or withdrawn from the construction reserve fund shall be applied against amounts deposited in the order of deposit.
            (3) If any deposit consists in part of gain not recognized under section 511(c) of the Act, then any expenditure, obligation, or withdrawal applied against such deposit shall be considered to consist of gain in the same proportion that the part of the deposit which constitutes gain bears to the total amount of the deposit.
            (b) Date of obligation. The date funds are obligated under a contract for the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels, rather than the date of payment from the fund, will determine the order of application against the deposits in the fund. When a contract for the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels is entered into, amounts on deposit in the construction reserve fund will be deemed to be obligated to the extent of the amount of the taxpayer's liability under the contract. Deposits will be deemed to be so obligated in the order of deposit, each new contract obligating the earliest deposit not previously expended, obligated, or withdrawn. If the liability under the contract exceeds the amount in the construction reserve fund, the contract will be deemed to obligate, to the extent of that part of such excess not otherwise satisfied, the earliest deposit or deposits thereafter made.
            (c) Illustration. The foregoing rules are illustrated in the following example:
            
            
              Example.
              (1) A taxpayer who makes his returns on the calendar year basis sells a vessel in 1963 for $1,000,000, realizing a gain of $400,000. Payment of $100,000 is received in March 1963 when the contract is signed, and the balance of $900,000 is received in June 1963 on delivery of the vessel. The $1,000,000 is deposited in a construction reserve fund in July 1963. In December 1963, the taxpayer also deposits $150,000, representing earnings of that year. In 1964, he sells another vessel for $1,000,000, realizing a gain of $250,000. The sale price of $1,000,000 is received on delivery of the vessel in February 1964, and deposited in the construction reserve fund in March 1964. In September 1964, the taxpayer purchases for cash out of the construction reserve fund a new vessel for $1,750,000. To the cost of this vessel must be allocated the 1963 deposits of $1,150,000 and $600,000 of the March 1964 deposit. This leaves in the fund $400,000 of the March 1964 deposit. The amount of the unrecognized gain to be applied against the basis of the new vessel is $550,000, computed as follows: Gain of $400,000 represented in the 1963 deposits, plus the same proportion of the $250,000 gain represented in the March 1964 deposit ($1,000,000) which the amount ($600,000) allocated to the vessel is of the amount of the deposit, i.e., $400,000 plus 600,000/1,000,000 of $250,000 or $150,000, a total of $550,000. This reduces the basis of the new vessel to $1,200,000 ($1,750,000 less $550,000).
              (2) In 1965, the taxpayer sells a third vessel for $3,000,000, realizing a gain of $900,000. The $3,000,000 is received and deposited in the construction reserve fund in June 1965, making a total in the fund of $3,400,000. In December 1965, the taxpayer contracts for the construction of a second new vessel to cost a maximum of $3,200,000, thereby obligating that amount of the fund, and in June 1966, receives permission to withdraw the unobligated balance amounting to $200,000. To the cost of the second new vessel must be allocated the $400,000 balance of the March 1964 deposit and $2,800,000 of the June 1965 deposit. The unrecognized gain to be applied against the basis of such new vessel is that proportion of the gain represented in each deposit which the portion of the deposit allocated to the vessel bears to the amount of such deposit, i.e., 400,000/1,000,000 of $250,000, or $100,000 plus 2,800,000/3,000,000 of $900,000, or $840,000 making a total of $940,000. The $200,000 withdrawal is applied against the June 1965 deposit and the portion thereof which represents gain will be recognized as income for 1965, the year in which realized. The computation of the recognized gain is as follows: 200,000/3,000,000 of $900,000, or $60,000.
            
          
          
            § 287.19
            Requirements as to new vessels.
            (a) Requirements. For the purposes of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part, the new vessel must be—
            
            (1) Documented under the laws of the United States when it is acquired by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer must agree that when acquired it will be documented under the laws of the United States;
            (2)(i) Constructed in the United States after December 31, 1939, or (ii) its construction has been financed under Title V or Title VII of the Act, or (iii) its construction has been aided by a mortgage insured under Title XI of the Act; and
            (3) Either (i) of such type, size, and speed as the Administration determines to be suitable for use on the high seas or Great Lakes in carrying out the purposes of the Act, but of not less than 2,000 gross tons or of less speed than 12 knots, except that a particular vessel may be of lesser tonnage or speed if the Administration determines and certifies that the particular vessel is desirable for use by the United States in case of war or national emergency, or (ii) constructed to replace a vessel or vessels requisitioned or purchased by the United States, in which event it must be of such type, size, and speed as to constitute a suitable replacement for the vessel requisitioned or purchased, but if a vessel already built is acquired to replace a vessel or vessels requisitioned or purchased by the United States, such vessel must meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. Ordinarily, under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, a vessel constructed more than five years before the date on which deposits in a construction reserve fund are to be expended or obligated for acquisition of such vessel will not be considered suitable for use in carrying out the purpose of the Act, except that the five-year age limitation provided above in this sentence shall not apply to a vessel to be reconstructed before being placed in operation by the taxpayer.
            (b) Time of construction. A vessel will be deemed to be constructed after December 31, 1939, only if construction was commenced after that date. Subject to the provisions of this section, a new vessel may be newly built for the taxpayer, or may be acquired after it is built.
            (c) Replacement of vessels. It is not necessary that vessels shall be replaced vessels for vessel. The new vessels may be more or less in number than the replaced vessels, provided the other requirements of this section are met.
          
          
            § 287.20
            Obligation of deposits.
            (a) Time for obligation. Within three years from the date of any deposit in a construction reserve fund, unless extension is granted as provided in § 287.22, such deposit must be obligated under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels (or in the discretion of the Administration for a share therein), with not less than 121/2 percent of the construction or contract price of the entire vessel or vessels actually paid or irrevocably committed on account thereof or must be expended or obligated for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness to persons other than a parent company of, or a company affiliated or associated with, the mortgagor on a new vessel or vessels. Amounts on deposit in a construction reserve fund will be deemed to be obligated for expenditure when a binding contract of construction or acquisition has been entered into or when purchase-money indebtedness has been incurred and, if obligated under a contract of construction or acquisition, will be deemed to be irrevocably committed when due and payable in accordance with the terms of the contract of construction or acquisition.
            (b) Requirements for obligation. Unless otherwise authorized by the Administration, contracts for the construction of new vessels must be for a fixed price, or provide for a base price that may be adjusted for changes in labor and material costs not exceeding 15 percent of the base price. The fixed or base price, as the case may be, shall be fair and reasonable as determined by the Maritime Administration. Any financial or other interests between the taxpayer and the contractor shall be disclosed to the Administration by the taxpayer. Plans and specifications for the new vessel or vessels must be approved by the Administration to the extent it deems necessary. A deposit in a construction reserve fund may be expended or obligated for expenditure for procurement under an acquisition or construction contract of a part interest in a new vessel or vessels only after obtaining the written consent of the Administration. The granting of such consent shall be entirely in the discretion of the Administration and it may impose such conditions with respect thereto as it may deem necessary or advisable for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of section 511 of the Act. Applications for such consent shall be executed in triplicate, and, together with eight conformed copies thereof, filed with the Administration.
          
          
            § 287.21
            Period for construction of certain vessels.
            A new vessel constructed otherwise than under the provisions of Title V of the Act, and not purchased from the Administration must, within six months from the date of the construction contract, or within the period of any extension, be completed to the extent of not less than 5 percent as estimated by the Administration and certified by it to the Secretary of the Treasury. In case of a contract covering more than one vessel it will be sufficient if one of the vessels is 5 percent completed within the six months' period from the date of the contract or within the period of any extension, and so certified. All construction must be completed with reasonable dispatch as determined by the Administration. If, for causes within the control of the taxpayer, the entire construction is not completed with reasonable dispatch, the Administration will so certify to the Secretary of the Treasury. For the effect of such certification, see § 287.23.
          
          
            § 287.22
            Time extensions for expenditure or obligation.
            (a) Extensions. The Administration, upon application and a showing of proper circumstances, (1) may allow an extension of time within which deposits shall be expended or obligated, not to exceed one year, and upon a second application received before the expiration of the first extension, may allow an additional extension not to exceed one year, and (2) may allow an extension or extensions of time within which five percent of the construction shall have been completed as provided in § 287.21 not to exceed one year in the aggregate, and (3) may allow any other extensions that may be provided by amendment to the Act.
            (b) Application required. A taxpayer seeking an extension of time shall make application therefor, and transmit it with an appropriate statement of the circumstances, including the reasons justifying the requested extension or extensions, and appropriate documents in substantiation of the statement, to the Administration. The Administration will notify the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of any extension granted. In case an application for extension is denied, the taxpayer will be liable for delay as though no application had been made.
          
          
            § 287.23
            Noncompliance with requirements.
            (a) Noncompliance. The amount of the gain which is that portion of the construction reserve fund otherwise constituting taxable income under the law applicable to the taxable year in which such gain was realized shall be included in the taxpayer's gross income for such taxable year for income or excess-profits tax purposes, if:
            (1) A portion of such fund is withdrawn for purposes other than—
            (i) The construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of a new vessel; or
            (ii) The liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness to persons other than a parent company of, or a company affiliated or associated with, the mortgagor on a new vessel or vessels; or
            (2) The taxpayer fails to comply with the requirements of section 511 of the Act or the regulations in this part relating to the utilization of construction reserve funds in the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of a new vessel, or the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such a vessel.

            If securities on deposit in a construction reserve fund are sold and the amount placed in the fund in lieu thereof is less than the value of the securities at the time of their deposit, the difference between such market value and the amount placed in the fund in lieu of the securities will be deemed to have been withdrawn. With respect to the substitution of new financing in the case of an irrevocable commitment, see paragraph (d) of § 287.13.
            (b) Amount recognized. In the event of noncompliance with the prescribed conditions relative to any contract for construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels, recognition will extend to the entire amount of the gain represented in that portion of the construction reserve fund obligated under such contract. Thus, if the Administration determines and certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury that for causes within the control of the taxpayer construction under a contract is not completed with reasonable dispatch, the entire amount of the gain represented in the portion of the construction reserve fund obligated under the contract will be recognized even though all other conditions have been satisfied. In case of noncompliance with the requirements of section 511 of the Act or the regulations in this part, see the provisions of § 287.18 as to the allocation of gain.
            (c) Unreasonable accumulation. Noncompliance with the provisions of section 511 of the Act or the regulations in this part relative to the utilization of the deposited amounts may also, inasmuch as the provision of section 511(f) of the Act is then inapplicable, warrant an examination to ascertain whether such amounts constitute an unreasonable accumulation of earnings and profits within the meaning of part I (section 531 and following), subchapter G, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or corresponding provisions of prior law. If amounts are deposited and the fund maintained in good faith for the purpose of construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, and acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels, such amounts will be deemed to have been accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business.
          
          
            § 287.24
            Extent of tax liability.
            (a) Declared value excess-profits tax. Gain which is includible in gross income under § 287.23 shall be included in gross income for all income and excess-profits tax purposes, but not for the purposes of the declared value excess-profits tax and the capital stock tax as provided in section 511(i) of the Act. In lieu of any adjustment with respect to such declared value excess-profits tax, there is imposed for any taxable year ending on or before June 30, 1945, in which the gain is realized an additional tax of 1.1 percent of the amount of the gain. No additional capital stock tax liability is incurred.
            (b) Improper deposits. In the case of deposits in the construction reserve fund of amounts derived from sources other than those specified in section 511 of the Act, or in the case of failure to deposit an amount equal to the “net proceeds” or “net indemnity” within the period prescribed in section 511(c) of the Act and § 287.15, the taxpayer obtains no suspension or postponement of any tax liability and the tax is collectible without regard to the provisions of section 511(c) of the Act.
            (c) Time for filing claim subsequent to election under section 511(c)(2). If an election is made under section 511(c)(2) of the Act, and paragraph (a)(2) of § 287.12, and if computation or recomputation in accordance therewith is otherwise allowable but is prevented, on the date of filing of notice of such election, or within six months thereafter, by any statute of limitation, such computation or recomputation nevertheless shall be made notwithstanding such statute if a claim therefor is filed within six months after the date of making such election. If as the result of such computation or recomputation an overpayment is disclosed, a claim for refund on Form 843 should also be filed within such six months' period.
          
          
            § 287.25
            Assessment and collection of deficiencies.

            Any additional tax, including the 1.1 percent amount imposed by section 511(i) of the Act, due on account of withdrawal from a construction reserve fund, or failure to comply with section 511 of the Act or the regulations in this part, is collectible as a deficiency. Interest upon such deficiency will run from the date the withdrawal or noncompliance occurs. The amount of any deficiency, including interest and additions to the tax, determined as a result of such withdrawal or noncompliance, may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection thereof may be begun without assessment, at any time and without regard to any period of limitations or any other provisions of law or rule of law, including the doctrine of res judicata.
          
          
            § 287.26
            Reports by taxpayers.
            (a) Information required. With each income tax return filed for a taxable year during any part of which a construction reserve fund is in existence the taxpayer shall submit a statement setting forth a detailed analysis of such fund. The statement, which need not be on any prescribed form, shall include the following information with respect to the construction reserve fund:
            (1) The actual balance in the fund at the beginning and end of the taxable year;
            (2) The date, amount, and source of each deposit during the taxable year;
            (3) If any deposit referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section consists of proceeds from the sale, or indemnification of loss, of a vessel or share thereof, the amounts of the unrecognized gain;
            (4) The date, amount, and purpose of each expenditure or withdrawal from the fund; and
            (5) The date and amount of each contract, under which deposited funds are deemed to be obligated during the taxable year, for the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels, and the identification of such vessels.
            (b) Records required. Taxpayers shall keep such records and make such additional reports as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the Administration may require.
            
            
              Note:
              The records referred to in this section shall be retained for a period of six months beyond the termination or closing out of the reserve fund.
            
          
          
            § 287.27
            Controlled corporation.
            For the purpose of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part a new vessel is considered as constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned, or acquired by the taxpayer if constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned, or acquired by a corporation at a time when the taxpayer owns not less than 95 percent of the total number of shares of each class of stock of the corporation.
          
          
            § 287.28
            Administrative jurisdiction.
            Sections 287.3 to 287.11, inclusive, §§ 287.13 to 187.15, inclusive, and §§ 287.19 to 287.22, inclusive, deal primarily with matters under the jurisdiction of the Administration. Sections 287.12, 287.16 to 287.18, inclusive, and §§ 287.23 to 287.27, inclusive, deal primarily with matters under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Generally, matters relating to the establishment, maintenance, expenditure, and use of construction reserve funds and the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels are under the jurisdiction of the Administration; and matters relating to the determination, assessment, and collection of taxes are under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Correspondence should be addressed to the particular authority having jurisdiction in the matter.

              Applications.

After the Administrator has fully allocated authorized contracting authority through the award of the maximum number of vessels allowed under § 295.30(a), MARAD will not accept any applications for award of new Operating Agreements until additional contracting authority becomes available, or existing contracting authority reverts back to MARAD.
              (3) Reflagging for Eligible vessels. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, an applicant may remove a vessel from U.S. registry without MARAD approval if an application for a MSP Operating Agreement has been filed for that vessel, the applicant is qualified, and it has been determined by MARAD to be eligible under MSA section 651(b)(1) under a priority for which sufficient funds are available and the Administrator has not awarded an Operating Agreement for the vessel within 90 days of that application.
              (4) Reflagging ODS and MSC chartered vessels. Vessels eligible under MSA section 651(b)(1) which are also subject to ODS contracts or on charter to MSC, and for which applications have been denied pursuant to § 295.11(a)(1) of this part, may be removed from U.S. registry only after those agreements have expired and only after the age requirement in section 9(e)(3) of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 808) has been met.
              (b) Action by the Applicant. Applicants for MSP Payments shall submit information on the following (Note: MARAD will accept electronic options (such as facsimile and Internet) for transmission of required information to MARAD, if practicable):
              (1) Intermodal network. A statement describing its operating and transportation assets, including vessels, container stocks, trucks, railcars, terminal facilities, and systems used to link such assets together;

              § 295.12
              Priority for awarding agreements.
              Subject to the availability of appropriations, MARAD shall enter into individual MSP Operating Agreements for Eligible Vessels according to the following priorities:
              (a) First priority requirements. First priority shall be accorded to any Eligible Vessel meeting the following requirements:
              (1) U.S. citizen ownership. Vessels owned and operated by persons who are Citizens of the United States as defined in § 295.2; or
              (2) Other corporations. Vessels less than 10 years of age and owned and operated by a corporation that is:
              (i) eligible to document a vessel under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121; and

              (ii) affiliated with a corporation operating or managing for the Secretary of Defense other vessels documented under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121, or chartering other vessels to the Secretary of Defense.
              
              (3) Limitation on number of vessels. Limitation on the total number of Eligible Vessels awarded under paragraph (a) of this section shall be:
              (i) For any U.S. citizen under paragraph (a)(1), the number of vessels may not exceed the sum of:
              (A) the number of U.S.-flag documented vessels that the Contractor or a related party operated in the foreign commerce of the United States on May 17, 1995, except mixed coastwise and foreign commerce; and
              (B) the number of U.S.-flag documented vessels the person chartered to the Secretary of Defense on that date; and
              (ii) For any corporation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, not more than five Eligible Vessels.
              (4) Related party. For the purpose of this section a related party with respect to a person shall be treated as the person.
              (b) Second priority requirements. To the extent that appropriated funds are available after applying the first priority in paragraph (a) of this section, the MARAD shall enter into individual MSP Operating Agreements for Eligible Vessels owned and operated by a person who is:
              (1) U.S. citizen. A Citizen of the United States, as defined in § 295.2(g), that has not been awarded a MSP Operating Agreement under the priority in paragraph (a) of this section, or
              (2) Other. A person (individual or entity) eligible to document a vessel under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121, and affiliated with a person or corporation operating or managing other U.S.-documented vessels for the Secretary of Defense or chartering other vessels to the Secretary of Defense.
              (c) Third priority. To the extent that appropriated funds are available after applying the first and second priority, any other Eligible Vessel.
              (d) Number of MSP Operating Agreements Awarded. If appropriated funds are not sufficient to award agreements to all vessels within a priority set forth herein, MARAD shall award to each eligible applicant in that priority a number of Operating Agreements that bears approximately the same ratio to the total number of Operating Agreements requested under that priority, and for which timely applications have been made, as the amount of appropriations available for MSP Operating Agreements for Eligible Vessels in the priority bears to the amount of appropriations necessary for MSP Operating Agreements for all Eligible Vessels in the priority.
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Maritime Security Program Operating Agreements
            
              § 295.20
              General conditions.
              (a) Approval. MARAD may approve applications to enter into a MSP Operating Agreement and make MSP Payments with respect to vessels that are determined to be necessary to maintain a United States presence in international commercial shipping or those that are deemed, after consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to be militarily useful for meeting the sealift needs of the United States in national emergencies.
              (b) Effective date—(1) General Rule. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the effective date of a MSP Operating Agreement is the date when executed by the Contractor and MARAD.
              (2) Exceptions. In the case of an Eligible Vessel to be included in a MSP Operating Agreement that is subject to an ODS contract under subtitle A, title VI, of the act or on charter to the U.S. Government, other than a charter under the provisions of an Emergency Preparedness Program Agreement provided by section 653 of the act, unless an earlier date is requested by the applicant, the effective date for a MSP Operating Agreement shall be:
              (i) The expiration or termination date of the ODS contract or Government charter covering the vessel, respectively, or
              (ii) Any earlier date on which the vessel is withdrawn from that contract or charter.
              (c) Replacement Vessels. MARAD may approve the replacement of an Eligible Vessel in a MSP Operating Agreement provided the replacement vessel is eligible under § 295.10.
              (d) Notice to shipbuilders. The Contractor agrees that no later than 30 days after soliciting any offer or bid for the construction of any vessel in a foreign shipyard, and before entering into any contract for construction of a vessel in a foreign shipyard, the Contractor shall provide notice of its intent to enter into such a contract (for vessels being considered for U.S.-flag registry) to MARAD. Within 10 business days after the receipt of such notification, MARAD shall issue a notice in the Federal Register of the Contractor's intent. The Contractor is prohibited from entering into any such contract until 10 business days after the date of publication of such notice.
              (e) Early termination. A MSP Operating Agreement shall terminate on a date specified by the Contractor if the Contractor notifies MARAD not later than 60 days before the effective date of the proposed termination, that the Contractor intends to terminate the Agreement. The Contractor shall be bound by the provisions relating to vessel documentation and national security commitments to the extent and for the period contained in section 652(m) of the Act.
              (f) Non-renewal for lack of funds. If, by the first day of a fiscal year, insufficient funds have been appropriated under section 655 of the act for that fiscal year, MARAD shall notify the Congress that MSP Operating Agreements for which insufficient funds are available will be terminated on the 60th day of that fiscal year if sufficient funds are not appropriated or otherwise made available by that date. If only partial funding is appropriated by the 60th day of such fiscal year, then MSP Operating Agreements for which funds are not available shall be terminated using the pro rata distribution method used to award MSP Operating Agreements set forth in § 295.12(d). With respect to each terminated agreement the Contractor shall be released from any further obligation under the agreement, and the Contractor may transfer and register the applicable vessel under a foreign registry deemed acceptable by MARAD. In the event that no funds are appropriated, then all MSP Operating Agreements shall be terminated and each Contractor shall be released from its obligations under the agreement. Final payments under the terminated agreements shall be made in accordance with § 295.30. To the extent that funds are appropriated in a subsequent fiscal year, existing operating agreements may be renewed if mutually acceptable to the Administrator and the Contractor and the MSP vessel remains eligible.
              (g) Operation under a Continuing Resolution. In the event a Continuing Resolution (CR) is in place that does not provide sufficient appropriations to fully meet obligations under MSP Operating Agreements, a Contractor may request termination of the agreement in accordance with paragraph (f), herein, and § 295.30.
              (h) Requisition authority. To the extent section 902 of the act is applicable to any vessel transferred foreign under this section, the vessel shall remain available to be requisitioned by the Maritime Administration under that provision of law.
              (i) Transfer of Operating Agreements. A Contractor subject to an Agreement may transfer that Agreement (including all rights and obligations thereunder) to any person eligible to enter into an Agreement under the same priority established in section 652(i)(1)(A) of the act as the Contractor, provided that:
              (1) The Contractor gives notice of any such transfer to the Maritime Administrator by filing a completed application;
              (2) The transfer is not disapproved in writing by the Maritime Administrator within 90 days of the notification; and
              (3) the vessel to be covered by the Agreement after transfer is the same vessel originally covered by the Agreement or is an eligible vessel under section 651(b) of the act and is the same type, and comparable to, the vessel originally covered by the Agreement.
            
            
              § 295.21
              MSP assistance conditions.
              (a) Term of MSP Operating Agreement. MSP Operating Agreements shall be effective for a period of not more than one fiscal year, and unless otherwise specified in the Agreement, shall be renewable, subject to the availability of appropriations or amounts otherwise made available, for each subsequent fiscal year through the end of FY 2005. In the event appropriations are enacted after October 1 with respect to any subsequent fiscal year, October 1 shall be considered the effective date of the renewed agreement, provided sufficient funds are made available and subject to the Contractor's rights for early termination pursuant to section 652(m) of the act.
              (b) Terms under a Continuing Resolution (CR). In the event funds are available under a CR, the terms and conditions of the MSP Operating Agreements shall be in force provided sufficient funds are available to fully meet obligations under MSP Operating Agreements, and only for the period stipulated in the applicable CR. If funds are not appropriated at sufficient levels for any portion of a fiscal year, the terms and conditions of any applicable MSP Operating Agreement may be voided and the Contractor may request termination of the MSP Operating Agreement in accordance with § 295.20(f).
              (c) National security requirements. Each MSP Operating Agreement shall require the owner or operator of an Eligible Vessel included in that agreement to enter into an Emergency Preparedness Program Agreement pursuant to section 653 of the act.
              (d) Vessel operating requirements. The MSP Operating Agreement shall require that during the period an Eligible Vessel is included in that Agreement, the Eligible Vessel shall:
              (1) Documentation. Be documented as a U.S.-flag vessel under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121; and
              (2) Operation. Be operated exclusively in the U.S.-foreign trade or in mixed foreign and domestic trade allowed under a registry endorsement issued under 46 U.S.C. 12105, and shall not otherwise be operated in the coastwise trade of the United States.
              (e) Limitations. Limitations on Contractors with respect to the operation of foreign-flag vessels shall be in accordance with section 804 of the act, as amended. The operation of vessels, other than Agreement Vessels, in the noncontiguous trades shall be limited in accordance with service levels and conditions permitted in section 656 of the act.
              (f) Non-Contiguous Domestic Trade. [Reserved]
              (g) Obligation of the U.S. Government. The amounts payable as MSP Payments under a MSP Operating Agreement shall constitute a contractual obligation of the United States Government to the extent of available appropriations.

              (1) Existing vessel. Within one year after the initial effective date of the MSP Operating Agreement in the case of a vessel in existence on that date and after notification to MARAD within 30 days of the Contractor's intent; or
              (2) New building. Within 30 months after the initial effective date of the MSP Operating Agreement in the case of a vessel to be constructed after that date.
              (b) Unused authority. In the event of a termination of unused authority pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, such authority shall revert to MARAD.

            Subpart D—Payment and Billing Procedures
            
              § 295.30
              Payment.
              (a) Amount payable. A MSP Operating Agreement shall provide, subject to the availability of appropriations and to the extent the agreement is in effect, for each Agreement Vessel, an annual payment of $2,100,000 for each fiscal year. This amount shall be paid in equal monthly installments at the end of each month. The annual amount payable shall not be reduced except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and § 295.31(a)(3).
              (b) Reductions in amount payable. (1) The annual amount otherwise payable under a MSP Operating Agreement shall be reduced on a pro rata basis for each day less than 320 in a fiscal year that an Agreement Vessel is not operated exclusively in the U.S.-foreign trade or in mixed foreign and domestic trade allowed under a registry endorsement issued under 46 U.S.C. 12105. Days during which the vessel is drydocked or undergoing survey, inspection, or repair shall be considered to be days during which the vessel is operated, provided the total of such days within a fiscal year does not exceed 30 days, unless prior to the expiration of a vessel's 30 day period, approval is obtained from MARAD for an extension of the 30 day provision.
              (2) There shall be no payment for any day that a MSP Agreement Vessel is engaged in transporting more than 7,500 tons (using the U.S. English standard of short tons, which converts to 6,696.75 long tons, or 6,803.85 metric tons) of civilian bulk preference cargoes pursuant to section 901(a), 901(b), or 901b of the act, provided that it is bulk cargo.
            
            
              § 295.31
              Criteria for payment
              (a) Submission of voucher. For contractors operating under more than one MSP Operating Agreement, the contractor may submit a single monthly voucher applicable to all its agreements. Each voucher submission shall include a certification that the vessel(s) for which payment is requested were operated in accordance with § 295.21(d) and applicable MSP Operating Agreements with MARAD, and consideration shall be given to reductions in amounts payable as set forth in § 295.30. All submissions shall be forwarded to the Director, Office of Accounting, MAR-330 Room 7325, Maritime Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Payments shall be paid and processed under the terms and conditions of the Prompt Payment Act, 31 U.S.C. 3901.
              (1) Payments shall be made per vessel, in equal monthly installments, of $175,000.

              (2) To the extent that reductions under § 295.30(b) are known, such reductions shall be applied at the time of the current billing. The daily reduction amounts shall be based on the annual amounts in 295.30(a) of this part divided by 365 days (366 days in leap years) and rounded to the nearest cent. Daily reduction amounts shall be applied as follows:
              
              
                FY 1997—$5,753.42

                FY 2004—$5,737.70
                FY 2005—$5,753.42
              
              
              (3) In the event a monthly payment is for a period less than a complete month, that month's payment shall be calculated by multiplying the appropriate daily rate in § 295.31(a)(2) by the actual number of days the Eligible Vessel operated in accordance with § 295.21.
              (4) MARAD may require, for good cause, that a portion of the funds payable under this section be withheld if the provisions of § 295.21(d) have not been met.

              (5) Amounts owed to MARAD for reductions applicable to a prior billing period shall be electronically transferred using MARAD's prescribed format, or a check may be forwarded to the Maritime Administration, P.O. Box 845133, Dallas, Texas 75284-5133, or the amount owed can be credited to MARAD by offsetting amounts payable in future billing periods.

              (3) The Secretary will not enter into more than five MSP Operating Agreements for tank vessels under this priority. If the five tank vessel MSP Operating Agreement slots are not fully subscribed, the Secretary, in consultation with the SecDef, may award the non-subscribed slots to lower priority vessels, if deemed appropriate. If the Secretary determines that no funds are, or are likely to be, allocated for any tank vessel construction in the United States, the five slots may nevertheless be awarded to existing tank vessels or the slots may be awarded permanently to any eligible vessels. The Secretary may temporarily award a slot reserved for a tank vessel under construction to a lower priority vessel during the construction period of that vessel if an existing tank vessel offered by the tank vessel Contractor is not eligible for priority for that slot. If no existing tank vessel is offered by the tank vessel Contractor, the Secretary may temporarily award an MSP Operating Agreement to any eligible vessel of another Contractor until a new tank vessel's construction is completed in the United States. Such temporary MSP Operating Agreements may be terminated under terms set forth in the temporary MSP Operating Agreement.

              Subsequent awards of MSP Operating Agreements.
              (a) MARAD intends to ensure that all available MSP Operating Agreements are fully utilized at all times in order to maximize the benefit of the MSP. Accordingly, when an MSP Operating Agreement becomes available through termination by the Secretary or early termination by the MSP contractor, and no transfer under 46 U.S.C. 53105(e) is involved, MARAD will reissue the MSP Operating Agreement pursuant to the following criteria:
              (1) The proposed vessel shall meet the requirements for vessel eligibility in 46 U.S.C. 53102(b);
              (2) The applicant shall meet the vessel ownership and operating requirements for priority in 46 U.S.C. 53102(c); and
              (3) Priority will be assigned on the basis of vessel type established by military requirements specified by the Secretary of Defense. After consideration of military requirements, priority shall be given to an applicant that is a United States citizen under section 50501 of this title.
              (b) MARAD shall allow an applicant at least 30 days to submit an application for a new MSP Operating Agreement.
              (c) MARAD and USTRANSCOM will determine if the applications received form an adequate pool for award of a reissued MSP Operating Agreement. If so, MARAD will award a reissued MSP Operating Agreement from that pool of qualified applicants in its discretion according to the procedures of paragraph (a) of this section, subject to approval of the Secretary of Defense. MARAD and USTRANSCOM may decide to open a new round of applications. MARAD shall provide written reasons for denying applications. In as much as MSP furthers a public purpose and MARAD does not acquire goods or services through MSP, the selection process for award of MSP Operating Agreements does not constitute an acquisition process subject to any procurement law or the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

            Subpart D—Maritime Security Program Operating Agreements
            
              § 296.30
              General conditions.
              (a) Approval. The Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense, may approve applications to enter into a MSP Operating Agreement and make MSP Payments with respect to vessels that are determined by the Secretary to be commercially viable and deemed by the Secretary of Defense to be militarily useful for meeting the sealift needs of the United States in time of war or national emergencies. The Secretary announced an initial award of 60 MSP Operating Agreements on January 12, 2005. In June 2014, the Secretary extended the term of all 60 MSP Operating Agreements through FY 2025.
              (b) Effective date—(1) General rule. Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of an MSP Operating Agreement is October 1, 2005.
              (2) Exceptions. In the case of an Eligible Vessel to be included in an MSP Operating Agreement that is on charter to the U.S. Government, other than a charter under the provisions of an Emergency Preparedness Agreement (EPA) provided by 46 U.S.C. 53107, as amended, unless an earlier date is requested by the applicant, the effective date for an MSP Operating Agreement shall be:
              (i) The expiration or termination date of the Government charter covering the vessel; or
              (ii) Any earlier date on which the vessel is withdrawn from that charter, but not before October 1, 2005.
              (c) Replacement vessels. A Contractor may replace an MSP vessel under an MSP Operating Agreement with another vessel that is eligible to be included in the MSP under section 296.11(a), if the Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense, approves the replacement vessel.
              (d) Termination by the Secretary. If the Contractor materially fails to comply with the terms of the MSP Operating Agreement:
              (1) The Secretary shall notify the Contractor and provide a reasonable opportunity for the Contractor to comply with the MSP Operating Agreement;
              (2) The Secretary shall terminate the MSP Operating Agreement if the Contractor fails to achieve such compliance; and
              (3) Upon such termination, any funds obligated by the relevant MSP Operating Agreement shall be available to the Secretary to carry out the MSP.
              (e) Early termination by Contractor, generally. An MSP Operating Agreement shall terminate on a date specified by the Contractor if the Contractor notifies the Secretary not later than 60 days before the effective date of the proposed termination that the Contractor intends to terminate the MSP Operating Agreement. The Contractor shall be bound by the provisions relating to vessel documentation and national security commitments, and by its EPA for the full term, from October 1, 2005, through September 30, 2025, of the MSP Operating Agreement.
              (f) [Reserved]
              (g) Non-renewal for lack of funds. If, by the first day of a fiscal year, sufficient funds have not been appropriated under the authority of MSA 2003, as amended, for that fiscal year, the Secretary will notify the Senate Committees on Armed Services and Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and the House of Representatives Committee on Armed Services, that MSP Operating Agreements for which sufficient funds are not available will not be renewed for that fiscal year if sufficient funds are not appropriated by the 60th day of that fiscal year. If only partial funding is appropriated by the 60th day of such fiscal year, then the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall select the vessels to retain under MSP Operating Agreements, based on the Secretaries' determinations of the most militarily useful and commercially viable vessels. In the event that no funds are appropriated, then all MSP Operating Agreements shall be terminated, and each Contractor shall be released from its obligations under the MSP Operating Agreement. Final payments under the terminated MSP Operating Agreements shall be made in accordance with § 296.41. To the extent that funds are appropriated in a subsequent fiscal year, former MSP Operating Agreements may be reinstated if mutually acceptable to the Administrator and the Contractor, provided the MSP vessel remains eligible.
              (h) Release of vessels from obligations. If sufficient funds are not appropriated for payments under an MSP Operating Agreement for any fiscal year by the 60th day of that fiscal year, then—
              (1) Each vessel covered by a terminated MSP Operating Agreement is released from any further obligation under the MSP Operating Agreement;
              (2) The owner and operator of a non-tank vessel may transfer and register the applicable vessel under foreign registry deemed acceptable by the Secretary and the SecDef, notwithstanding 46 U.S.C. chapter 561 and 46 CFR part 221;
              (3) If section 902 of the Act is applicable to a vessel that has been transferred to a foreign registry due to a terminated MSP Operating Agreement, then that vessel is available to be requisitioned by the Secretary pursuant to section 902 of the Act; and
              (4) Paragraph (h) of this section is not applicable to vessels under MSP Operating Agreements that have been terminated for any other reason.
              (i) Foreign transfer of vessel. A Contractor may transfer a non-tank vessel to a foreign registry, without approval of the Secretary, if the Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense, determines that the contractor will provide a replacement vessel:
              (1) Of equal or greater military capability and of a capacity that is equivalent or greater as measured in deadweight tons, gross tons, or container equivalent units, as appropriate;
              (2) That is a documented vessel under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121 by the owner of the vessel to be placed under a foreign registry; and
              (3) That is not more than 10 years of age on the date of that documentation.
              (j) Transfer of MSP Operating Agreements. A contractor under an MSP Operating Agreement may transfer the agreement (including all rights and obligations under the MSP Operating Agreement) to any person that is eligible to enter into the MSP Operating Agreement under this chapter if the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense determine that the transfer is in the best interests of the United States. A transaction shall not be considered a transfer of an MSP Operating Agreement if the same legal entity with the same vessels remains the contracting party under the MSP Operating Agreement.

              § 296.31
              MSP assistance conditions.
              (a) Term of MSP Operating Agreement. MSP Operating Agreements are authorized for 20 years, starting on October 1, 2005, and ending on September 30, 2025, but payments to Contractors are subject to annual appropriations each fiscal year. MARAD may enter into MSP Operating Agreements for a period less than the full term authorized under the MSA 2003, as amended.
              (b) Terms under a Continuing Resolution (CR). In the event funds are available under a CR, the terms and conditions of the MSP Operating Agreements shall be in force provided sufficient funds are available to fully meet obligations under MSP Operating Agreements, and only for the period stipulated in the applicable CR. If funds are not appropriated under a CR at sufficient levels for any portion of a fiscal year, the Secretary will select the vessels to retain within the funding level of the previous fiscal year, in consultation with the SecDef, based on the Secretaries' determination of the most militarily useful and commercially viable vessels. With regard to an MSP Operating Agreement that does not receive funds, the terms and conditions of any applicable MSP Operating Agreement may be voided and the Contractor may request termination of the MSP Operating Agreement.
              (c) National security requirements. Each MSP Operating Agreement shall require the owner or operator of an Eligible Vessel included in that MSP Operating Agreement to enter into an EPA pursuant to section 53107 of the MSA 2003. The EPA shall be a document incorporating the terms of the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA), as approved by the Secretary and the SecDef, or other agreement approved by the Secretaries.
              (d) Vessel operating agreements. The MSP Operating Agreement shall require that during the period an Eligible Vessel is included in that MSP Operating Agreement, the Eligible Vessel shall:
              
              (1) Documentation: Be documented as a U.S.-flag vessel under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121;
              (2) Operation: Be operated exclusively in the foreign commerce or in mixed foreign commerce and domestic trade allowed under a registry endorsement issued under 46 U.S.C. 12111, and shall not otherwise be operated in the coastwise trade of the United States; and
              (3) Noncontiguous Domestic Trade: Not receive MSP payments during a period in which the Contractor participates, i.e., directly or indirectly owns, charters, or operates, a vessel engaged in noncontiguous domestic trade unless the Contractor is a Section 2 Citizen.
              (e) Obligation of the U.S. Government. The amounts payable as MSP payments under an MSP Operating Agreement shall constitute a contractual obligation of the United States Government to the extent of available appropriations.
              (f) U.S. Merchant Marine Academy cadets. The MSP Operator shall agree to carry on the MSP vessel two U.S. Merchant Marine Academy cadets, if available, on each voyage.

              The Contractor shall submit to the Director, Office of Financial Approvals, Maritime Administration, 2nd Floor, West Building, 1200 New Jersey Ave. SE., Washington, DC 20590, one of the following reports, including management footnotes where necessary to make a fair financial presentation:
              (a) Form MA-172: Not later than 120 days after the close of the Contractor's semiannual accounting period, a Form MA-172 on a semiannual basis, in accordance with 46 CFR 232.6; or
              (b) Financial Statement: Not later than 120 days after the close of the Contractor's annual accounting period, an audited financial statement in accordance with 46 CFR 232.6 and the most recent vessel operating cost data submitted as part of its EPA, or if not current year data, a Schedule 310 of the MA-172.

              § 296.41
              Payment procedures.
              (a) Amount payable. An MSP Operating Agreement shall provide, subject to the availability of appropriations and to the extent the MSP Operating Agreement is in effect, for each Agreement Vessel, an annual payment equal to $2,600,000 for FY 2006, FY 2007, FY 2008; $2,900,000 for FY 2009, FY 2010, FY 2011; $3,100,000 for FY 2012, FY 2013, FY 2014, and FY 2015; $3,500,000 for FY 2016; $4,999,950 for FY 2017; $5,000,000 for FY 2018, FY 2019, and FY 2020; $5,233,463 for FY 2021; and $3,700,000 for FY 2022, FY 2023, FY 2024, and FY 2025. This amount shall be paid in equal monthly installments at the end of each month. The annual amount payable shall not be reduced except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
              (b) Reductions in amount payable. (1) The annual amount otherwise payable under an MSP Operating Agreement shall be reduced on a pro rata basis for each day less than 320 in a fiscal year that an Agreement Vessel:
              (i) Is not operated exclusively in the foreign commerce, except for tank vessels, which may be operated in foreign-to-foreign commerce;
              (ii) Is operated in the coastwise trade; or
              (iii) Is not documented under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121.
              (2) To the extent that a Contractor operates MSP vessels less than 320 days under the provisions of § 296.31(d), payments will be reduced for each day less than 320 days.
              (c) No payment. (1) Regardless of whether the Contractor has or will operate for 320 days in a fiscal year, a Contractor shall not be paid:
              (i) For any day that an Agreement Vessel is engaged in transporting more than 7,500 tons (using the U.S. English standard of short tons, which converts to 6,696.75 long tons, or 6,803.85 metric tons) of civilian bulk preference cargoes pursuant to section 901(a), 901(b), or 901b of the Act, provided that it is bulk cargo;
              (ii) During a period in which the Contractor participates in noncontiguous domestic trade, unless that Contractor is a Section 2 Citizen;
              (iii) While under charter to the United States Government other than a charter pursuant to an EPA under § 53107 of the MSA 2003. A voyage charter that is essentially a contract of affreightment will not be considered to be a charter;
              (iv) For a vessel in excess of 25 years of age, except for a LASH vessel in excess of 30 years of age or a tank vessel which is limited to 20 years of age, unless the vessel is a Participating Fleet Vessel meeting the requirements of § 296.21(e);
              (v) For days in excess of 30 days in a fiscal year in which a vessel is drydocked or undergoing survey, inspection, or repair unless prior to the expiration of the vessel's 30-day period, approval is obtained from MARAD for an extension beyond 30 days. Drydocking, survey, inspection, or repair periods of 30 days or less are considered operating days; and
              (vi) If the contracted vessel is not operated or maintained in accordance with the terms of the MSP Operating Agreement.
              (2) To the extent that non-payment days under paragraph (c) of this section are known, Contractor payments shall be reduced at the time of the current billing. The daily reduction amounts shall be based on the annual amounts in paragraph (a) of this section divided by 365 days (366 days in leap years) and rounded to the nearest cent. Daily reduction amounts shall be applied.
              (3) MARAD may require, for good cause, that a portion of the funds payable under this section be withheld if the provisions of § 296.31(d) have not been met.
              (4) Amounts owed to MARAD for reductions applicable to a prior billing period shall be electronically transferred using MARAD's prescribed format, or a check may be forwarded to the Maritime Administration, P.O. Box 845133, Dallas, Texas 75284-5133, or the amount owed can be credited to MARAD by offsetting amounts payable in future billing periods.

              Administrative determinations.
              (a) Policy. A Contractor who disagrees with the findings, interpretations or decisions of the Maritime Administration or the Contracting Officer with respect to the administration of this part or any other dispute or complaint concerning MSP Operating Agreements may submit an appeal to the Administrator. Such appeals shall be made in writing to the Secretary, within 60 days following the date of the document notifying the Contractor of the administrative determination of the Contracting Officer. Such an appeal should be addressed to the Maritime Administrator, Attn.: MSP Operating Agreement Appeals, Maritime Administration, 400 Seventh St., SW., Washington, DC 20590. Such an appeal is a prerequisite to exhausting administrative remedies.
              
              (b) DOD determinations. The MSA 2003 assigns joint and separate roles and responsibilities to the Secretary and to the SecDef. The Administrator and the Commander will make joint and separate findings, interpretations, and decisions necessary to implement the MSA 2003. A Contractor who disagrees with the initial findings, interpretations or decisions regarding the implementation of the MSA 2003—whether joint or separate in nature—shall communicate such disagreement to the Contracting Officer. Any disagreement or dispute of a Contractor may, where appropriate, be transferred to the Director, Policy and Plans, U.S. Transportation Command (Director), for resolution. A Contractor who disagrees with the findings, interpretations, or decisions of the Director, with respect to the administration of this part, may submit an appeal to the Commander. Such an appeal shall be made in writing to the Commander within 60 days following the date of the document notifying the Contractor of the administrative determination of the Director. Such an appeal should be addressed to the Commander, U.S. Transportation Command, 508 Scott Drive, Scott Air Force Base, IL 62225-5357.
              (c) Process. The Administrator, or the Commander in the case of a DOD determination, may require the person making the request to furnish additional information, or proof of factual allegations, and may order any proceeding appropriate in the circumstances. The decision of the Administrator, or the Commander in the case of a DOD determination, shall be final.

              (4) Applications from those willing to take guarantees for less than the normal term for that class of vessel.
              (5) Eligible Export Vessels. We may issue a commitment to guarantee Obligations for an Eligible Export Vessel if we determine, in our sole discretion, that the issuance of a commitment to guarantee Obligations for an Eligible Export Vessel will not cause us to deny an economically sound application to issue a commitment to guarantee Obligations for vessels documented under the laws of the United States operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States, after considering:
              (i) The status of pending applications for commitments to guarantee obligations for vessels documented under the laws of the United States and operating or to be operated in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States;
              (ii) The economic soundness of the applications referred to in paragraph (k)(5)(i) of this section; and

              (iii) Laws of the ports it serves.
              (b) Actual Cost. We must approve your estimated Actual Cost for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a Vessel as a condition for issuance of the Letter Commitment. The estimated cost of the Vessel may include escalation for the anticipated construction period of the Vessel. We may contact the shipyard directly and may require you to have the shipyard that has contracted to build the Vessel to submit additional technical data, backup cost details, and other evidence if we have insufficient data.
              (c) Class, condition, and operation. The Vessel must be constructed, maintained, and operated so as to meet the highest classification, certification, rating, and inspection standards for vessels of the same age and type imposed by:
              (1) The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), or
              (2) Another classification society that also meets the inspection standards of the United States Coast Guard with respect to the documentation of U.S.-flag vessels, or
              (3) In the case of an Eligible Export Vessel, such standards as may be imposed by a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), classification societies to be ISO 9000 series registered or Quality Systems Certificate Scheme qualified IACS members who have been recognized by the United States Coast Guard as meeting acceptable standards with such recognition including, at a minimum, that the society meets the requirements of IMO Resolution A.739(18) with appropriate certificates required at delivery, so long as the home country of the IACS member accords equal reciprocity, as determined by us, to United States classification societies.
              (4) Except in the case of an Eligible Export Vessel, the Vessel must be in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations as to condition and operation, including, but not limited to, those administered by the:

              (d) Documentation. (1) An Eligible Export Vessel must be documented in a country that is party to the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, or other treaty, convention, or international agreement governing vessel inspection to which the United States is a signatory, and must comply with the applicable laws, rules, and regulations of its country of documentation, all applicable treaties, conventions on international agreements to which that country is a signatory, and the laws of the ports it serves.
              (2) All other Eligible Vessels must be documented under U.S. registry.
              (e) Reconstruction or reconditioning. Repairs necessary for the Vessel to meet the classification standards approved by us, or any regulatory body, or for previous inadequate maintenance and repair, will not constitute reconstruction or reconditioning within the meaning of this paragraph.
              (f) Condition survey. If your application involves a reconstructed or reconditioned Vessel, you must make the Vessel available at a time and place acceptable to us so that we may conduct a condition survey. You must:
              (1) Pay the cost of the condition survey.
              (2) Ensure that the scope and extent of the condition survey will not be less effective than that required by the last ABS special survey completed (if the Vessel is classified), next due or overdue, whichever date is nearest in accordance with the Vessel's age.
              (3) Ensure that the Vessel meets the standard of the survey necessary for retention of class (if the Vessel is classified), and
              (4) Ensure that the operating records of the Vessel reflect normal operation of the Vessel's main propulsion and other machinery and equipment, consistent with accepted commercial experience and practice.
              (g) Metric Usage. Our preferred system of measurement and weights for Vessels and Shipyard Projects is the metric system.

              (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2133-0005)
              
              (d) Financial definitions. For the purpose of this section and §§ 298.35 and 298.42 of this part:
              (1) “Company” means any Person subject to financial requirements imposed under paragraph (f) of this section and in § 298.35, as well as the reporting requirements imposed by § 298.42.
              (2) “Working Capital” means the excess, if any, of current assets over current liabilities, both determined in accordance with GAAP and adjusted as follows:
              (i) In determining current assets you must exclude:
              (A) Any securities, obligations or evidence of indebtedness of a Related Party or of any stockholder, director, officer or employee (or any member of his family) of the Company or of such Related Party, except advances to agents required for the normal current operation of the Company's vessels and current receivables arising out of the ordinary course of business and not outstanding for more than 60 days; and
              (B) An amount equal to any excess of unterminated voyage revenue over unterminated voyage expenses.

              (ii) In determining current liabilities, you must deduct any excess of unterminated voyage expenses over unterminated voyage revenue and add one half of all annual charter hire and other lease obligations (having a term of more than six months) due and payable within the succeeding fiscal year, other than charter hire and such other lease obligations already included and reported as a current liability on the Company's balance sheet.
              (3) “Equity” or “net worth” means, as of any date, (the total of paid-in-capital stock, paid-in surplus, earned surplus and appropriated surplus,) and all other amounts that would be included in net worth in accordance with GAAP, but does not include:
              (i) Any receivables from any stockholder, director, Officer or employee (or their family) of the Company or from any Related Party (other than current receivables arising out of the ordinary course of business and not outstanding for more than 60 days), and
              (ii) Any increment resulting from the reappraisal of assets.
              (4) “Long-Term Debt” means, as of any date, the total notes, bonds, debentures, equipment obligations and other evidence of indebtedness that would be included in long term debt in accordance with GAAP. You must include any guarantee or other liability for the debt of any other Person not otherwise included on the balance sheet.
              (5) “Capitalizable Cost” means the aggregate of the Actual Cost of the Vessel or Shipyard Project and those other items which customarily would be capitalized as Vessel costs or Shipyard Project costs under GAAP.
              (6) “Depreciated Capitalizable Cost” means the Capitalizable Cost of a Vessel or Shipyard Project, depreciated on a straightline basis over the same useful life as determined by us for Actual Cost, and depreciated as required by § 298.21(g).
              (e) Applicability. The financial resources must be adequate to meet the Equity requirements in the project and Working Capital requirements, as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (1) The various financial requirements shall be met by the owner of the Vessel or Vessels or Shipyard Project to be security to us for the Guarantees, except that if the owner is not the operator, the overall financial requirements will be allocated among the owner, the operator and other parties as determined by us.
              (2) The Company must satisfy the applicable financial requirements, in addition to any other financial requirements already imposed or which may be imposed upon it in connection with other Vessels financed under the Title XI program or in connection with other Shipyard Project financed under the Title XI program.
              (3) A determination as to whether the Company has satisfied all financial requirements shall be based on the assumption that the projected financing has been completed. Accordingly, you must submit:
              (i) A pro forma balance sheet at the time of the application, reflecting any adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, and
              (ii) A revised pro forma balance sheet, reflecting the completion of the projected financing, at least five business days before the first Closing at which the Obligations are issued.
              (f) Financial requirements at Closing. Financial requirements can apply to one or more Companies, and are determined as follows:
              (1) Owner as operator. Where the owner is to be the Vessel operator, minimum requirements at Closing usually are as follows:
              (i) Working Capital. The Company's Working Capital shall not be less than one dollar. This Working Capital requirement is based on the premise that the Company engages in a service-type activity with only normal vessel inventory. If Working Capital includes other inventory, in addition to such normal Vessel inventory, we may adjust the requirement as appropriate. Also, if we determine that the Company's Working Capital includes amounts receivable that it reasonably could not expect to collect within one year, we may make adjustments to the Working Capital requirements.
              (ii) Long-Term Debt. The Company's Long-Term Debt must not be greater than twice its Equity.
              (iii) Equity (net worth). The Company's Equity must be:
              (A) The greater of:
              (1) 50 percent of its Long-Term Debt; or
              
              (2) 90 percent of its Equity as shown on the last audited balance sheet, dated not earlier than six months before the date of issuance of the Letter Commitment; or
              (B) Such other amount as may be specified by us.
              (2) Lessee or charterer as operator. Where a lessee or charterer is to be the Vessel operator, minimum requirements at Closing usually are as follows:
              (i) Working Capital. The operator's Working Capital requirement will be the same as that which would have otherwise been imposed on the owner as operator under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and based on the same premise stated in that paragraph.
              (ii) Long-Term Debt. The operator's Long-Term Debt will be the same as that which would have otherwise been imposed on the owner as operator under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (iii) Equity (net worth). The operator's equity requirement will be the same as that which would have otherwise been imposed on the owner as operator under paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section.
              (iv) The owner's Equity shall at least be equal to the difference between the Capitalizable Cost or Depreciated Capitalizable Cost of the Vessel (whichever is applicable) and the total amount of the Guarantees.
              (3) Owner as General Shipyard Facility. Where the owner of Shipyard Project is a General Shipyard Facility, minimum requirements at Closing will be the same as those set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section for an owner as operator.
              (g) Adjustments to financial requirements at Closing. If the owner, although not operating a Vessel, assumes any of the operating responsibilities, we may adjust the respective Working Capital and Equity requirements of the owner and operator, otherwise applicable under paragraph (f) of this section, by increasing the requirements of the owner and decreasing those of the operator by the same amount.
              (h) Subordinated debt considered to be Equity. With our consent, part of the Equity requirements applicable under paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section may be satisfied by debt, fully subordinated as to the payment of principal and interest on the Secretary's Note and any claims secured as provided for in the Security Agreement or the Mortgage. Repayment of subordinated debt may be made only from funds available for payment of dividends or for other distributions, in accordance with requirements of the Title XI Reserve Fund and Financial Agreement (described in § 298.35). Such subordinated debt shall not be secured by any interest in property that is security for Guarantees under Title XI, unless the Obligor and the lender enter into a written agreement, satisfactory to us, providing, among other things, that if any Title XI financing or advance by us to the Obligor shall occur in the future, such security interest of the lender shall become subordinated to any indebtedness to us incurred by the Obligor and to any security interest obtained by us in that property or other property, with respect to the subsequent indebtedness.
              (i) Modified requirements. We may waive or modify the financial terms or requirements otherwise applicable under this section and §§ 298.35 and 298.42, upon determining that there is adequate security for the Guarantees. We may impose similar financial requirements on any Person providing other security for the Guarantees.

              Economic soundness.
              (a) Economic Evaluation. We shall not issue a Letter Commitment for guarantees unless we find that the proposed project, regarding the Vessel(s) or Shipyard Project for which you seek Title XI financing or refinancing, will be economically sound. The economic soundness and your ability to repay the Obligations will be the primary basis for our approval of a Letter Commitment. We will consider the value of the collateral for which we will issue the Obligations as only a secondary consideration in determining your ability to repay the Obligations.
              (b) Basic feasibility factors. In making the economic soundness findings, we shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to:
              (1) The need in the particular segment of the maritime industry for new or additional capacity, including any impact on existing equipment for which a guarantee under this title is in effect;
              (2) The market potential for the employment of the Vessel or utilization of the Shipyard Project of a General Shipyard Facility over the life of the guarantee;
              (3) Projected revenues and expenses associated with employment of the Vessel or utilization of the Shipyard Project of a General Shipyard Facility;
              (4) Any charters, contracts of affreightment, transportation agreements, or similar agreements or undertakings relevant to the employment of the Vessel or utilization of the Shipyard Project of a General Shipyard Facility;
              (5) For inland waterways, the need for technical improvements including but not limited to increased fuel efficiency, or improved safety; and
              (6) Other relevant criteria.
              (c) Project Feasibility. To demonstrate the economic feasibility of the project over the Guarantee period, you must submit the following information:

The cash flow statements should be footnoted to explain the assumptions used.
              (d) Objective Criteria. We must make a finding of economic soundness as to each project based on an assessment of the entire project. In order for the project to receive approval, we must determine that a project meets the following criteria:
              (1) The projected long-term demand (equal to length of time that you request financing) for the particular Vessel(s) or new Shipyard Project to be financed must exceed the supply of similar vessels or new shipyard project in the applicable markets. We will determine the supply of similar vessels and similar shipyard projects based on:
              (i) Existing equipment,
              (ii) Similar vessels or new shipyard project under construction, and
              (iii) The projected need for new equipment in that particular segment of the maritime industry.
              (2) We will base our determination of the project's economic soundness on the following:
              (i) Conformity of your projections with our supply and demand analyses;
              (ii) Availability of charters, letters of intent, outstanding contractual commitments, contracts of affreightment, transportation agreements or similar agreements or undertakings; and
              (iii) Your existing market share compared with the market share necessary to meet projected revenues.
              (3) In cases where market conditions are temporarily inadequate for you to service the Obligation indebtedness at the time of Vessel delivery, or completion of the Shipyard Project, we may approve your application only if you have sufficient outside sources of cash flow to service your indebtedness during this temporary period.
              (4) With respect to the asset for which Obligations are to be issued, the operating cash flow to Obligation debt service ratio over the term of the Guarantee must be in excess of 1:1. Operating cash flow means revenues less operating and capital expenses including taxes paid but exclusive of interest, accrued taxes, depreciation and amortization for the Title XI asset. Debt service means interest plus principal.
            
            
              § 298.15
              Investigation fee.
              (a) In general. Before we issue a Letter Commitment, you shall pay us an investigation fee. The Letter Commitment will state the fee which is based on the formula in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (1) The investigation fee covers the cost of the investigation of the project described in the application and the participants in the project, the appraisal of properties offered as security, Vessel inspection during construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning (where applicable) and other administrative expenses.
              (2) If, for any reason, we disapprove the application, you shall pay one-half of the investigation fees.
              (b) Base Fee. (1) The investigation fee shall be one-half (1/2) of one percent on Obligations to be issued up to and including $10,000,000, plus
              (2) One-eighth (1/8) of one percent on all Obligations to be issued in excess of $10,000,000.
              (c) Credit for filing fee. You will receive credit for the $5,000 filing fee that you paid upon filing the original application (described in § 298.3) towards the investigation fee.
            
            
              § 298.16
              Substitution of participants.
              (a) You may request our permission to substitute participants to a Mortgage and/or Security Agreement in a financing that is receiving assistance authorized by Title XI of the Act.
              (b) A non-refundable fee of $3,000 is due, payable at the time of the request. The fee defrays all costs of processing and reviewing a joint application by a mortgagor and/or Obligor and a proposed transferee of a Vessel or Shipyard Project, which is security for Title XI debt, if the proposed transferee is to assume the Mortgage and/or the Security Agreement.
            
            
              § 298.17
              Evaluation of applications.
              (a) In evaluating project applications, we shall also consider whether the application provides for:
              (1) The capability of the Vessel(s) serving as a naval and military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency.
              (2) The financing of the Vessel(s) within one year after delivery.
              (3) The acquisition of Vessel(s) currently financed under Title XI by assumption of the total obligation(s).
              (4) The Guarantees extend for less than the normal term for that class of vessel.
              (5) In the case of an Eligible Shipyard, the capability of the shipyard to engage in naval vessel construction in time of war or national emergency.
              (6) In the case of Shipyard Project, the Guarantees extend for less than the technological life of the asset.
              (b) In determining the amount of equity which you must provide, we will consider, among other things, the following:
              (1) Your financial strength;
              (2) Adequacy of collateral; and
              (3) The term of the Guarantees.
            
            
              § 298.18
              Financing Shipyard Projects.
              (a) Initial criteria. We may issue Guarantees to finance a Shipyard Project at a General Shipyard Facility. We may approve such Guarantees after we consider whether the Guarantees will result in shipyard modernization and support increased productivity.
              (b) Detailed statement. You must provide a detailed statement, with the Guarantee application, which will provide the basis for our consideration.
              (c) Required conditions. We shall approve your application for loan guarantees under this section if we determine the following:
              (1) The term for such Guarantees will not exceed the reasonable economic useful life of the collective assets which comprise this Shipyard Project;
              (2) There is sufficient collateral to secure the Guarantee; and
              (3) Your application will not prevent us from guaranteeing debt for a Shipyard Project that, in our sole opinion, will serve a more desirable use of appropriated funds. In making this determination, we will consider:
              (i) The types of vessels which will be built by the shipyard,
              (ii) The productivity increases which will be achieved,
              (iii) The geographic location of the shipyard,
              (iv) The long-term viability of the shipyard,
              (v) The soundness of the financial transaction,

              (vi) Any financial impact on other Title XI transactions, and
              
              (vii) The furtherance of the goals of the Shipbuilding Act.
            
            
              § 298.19
              Financing Eligible Export Vessels.
              (a) Notification to Secretary of Defense. (1) We will provide prompt notice of our receipt of an application for a loan Guarantee for an Eligible Export Vessel to the Secretary of Defense.
              (2) During the 30-day period, beginning on the date on which the Secretary of Defense receives such notice, the Secretary of Defense may disapprove the loan guarantee if the Secretary of Defense makes an assessment that the Vessel's potential use may cause harm to United States national security interests.
              (3) The Secretary of Defense may not disapprove a loan Guarantee under this section solely on the basis of the type of vessel to be constructed with the loan Guarantee. The authority of the Secretary of Defense to disapprove a loan Guarantee under this section may not be delegated to any official other than a civilian officer of the Department of Defense appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. We will not approve a loan guarantee disapproved by the Secretary of Defense.
              (b) Vessel eligibility. We may not approve a Guarantee for an Eligible Export Vessel unless:
              (1) We find that the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the Vessel will aid in the transition of United States shipyards to commercial activities or will preserve shipbuilding assets that would be essential in time of war or national emergency;
              (2) The owner of the Vessel agrees with us that the Vessel shall not be transferred to any country designated by the Secretary of Defense as a country whose interests are hostile to the interests of the United States; and
              (3) We determine that the countries in which the shipowner, its charterers, guarantors, or other financial interests supporting the transaction, if any, have their chief executive offices or have located a substantial portion of their assets, present an acceptable financial or legal risk to our collateral interests. Our determination will be based on confidential risk assessments provided by the Inter-Agency Country Risk Assessment System and will take into account any other factors related to the loan guarantee transaction that we deem pertinent.
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Guarantees
            
              § 298.20
              Term, redemptions, and interest rate.
              (a) In general. The maturity date of the Obligations must be satisfactory to us and must not exceed the anticipated physical and economic life of the Vessel or Vessels or Shipyard Project, and may be less than but no more than:
              (1) Twenty-five years from the date of delivery from the shipbuilder of a single new Vessel which is to be security for Guarantees;
              (2) Twenty-five years from the date of delivery from the shipyard of the last of multiple Vessels which are to be security for the Guarantees but that the amount of the Guarantees will relate to the amount of the depreciated actual cost of the multiple Vessels as of the Closing;
              (3) The later of twenty-five years from the date of original delivery of a reconstructed, or reconditioned Vessel which is to be security for the Guarantees, or at the expiration of the remaining useful life of the Vessel, as we determine; or
              (4) The technological life of the Shipyard Project.
              (b) Required redemptions. Where multiple Vessels or multiple Shipyard Project assets are to be used as security for the Guarantees, as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, we may require payments of principal prior to maturity (redemptions) regarding all related Obligations, as we may deem necessary to maintain adequate security for the Guarantees.
              (c) Interest rate. We will make a determination as to the reasonableness of the interest rate of each Obligation, taking into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans and the risks that we assume.
            
            
              § 298.21
              Limits.
              (a) Actual Cost basis. We will issue a guarantee on an amount of the Obligation satisfactory to us based on the economic soundness of the transaction. The Obligation amount may be less than but not more than 75 percent or 871/2 percent, whichever is applicable, under the provisions of section 1104A(b)(2) or section 1104B(b)(2) of the Act of the Actual Cost of the Vessel or Vessels or Shipyard Project asset(s).
              (1) If minimum horsepower of the main engine is a requirement for Guarantees up to 871/2 percent of the Actual Cost, the standard for the horsepower will be continuous rated horsepower.
              (2) Where we refinance existing debt, the amount of new Obligations we issue for the existing debt may not exceed the lesser of:
              (i) The amount of outstanding debt being refinanced (whether or not receiving assistance under Title XI); or
              (ii) Seventy-five or 871/2 percent, whichever is applicable, of the Depreciated Actual Cost of the Vessel or Shipyard Project with respect to which the new Obligations are being issued.
              (b) Actual Cost items. Actual Cost is comprised essentially of those items which would customarily be capitalized as Vessel or Shipyard Project construction costs such as designing, engineering, constructing (including performance bond premiums that we approve), inspecting, outfitting and equipping.

              (1) Cost items include those items usually specified in Vessel or Shipyard Project construction contracts, e.g., changes and extras, cost of owner furnished equipment, shoreside spare parts and commitment fees and interest on the Obligations or other borrowings incurred during the construction period (excluding interest paid on subordinated debt considered to be Equity), and less income realized from investment of Escrow Fund deposits during the construction period.
              (2) Commissions (which represent a portion of the total shipyard contract price) may be included in the foreign equipment and services amount of the Actual Cost of an export project, provided:
              (i) A majority of the work done by the parties receiving the commissions is in the form of design and engineering work, and
              (ii) The commissions represent a small amount of the total contract price.
              (3) You may include Guarantee Fees determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1104(e) of the Act as an item of Actual Cost.
              (4) In approving an item of Actual Cost, we will consider all pertinent factors.
              (c) Items excludible from Actual Cost. Actual Cost shall not include any other costs such as the following:
              (1) Legal fees or expenses;
              (2) Accounting fees or expenses;
              (3) Commitment fees or interest other than those specifically allowed;
              (4) Fees, commissions or charges for granting or arranging for financing;
              (5) Fees or charges for preparing, printing and filing an application for Title XI Guarantees and supporting documents, for services rendered to obtain approval of the application and for preparing, printing and processing documents relating to the application for Guarantees;
              (6) Underwriting or trustee's fees;
              (7) Foreign, federal, state or local taxes, user fees, or other governmental charges;
              (8) Investigation fee determined in accordance with section 1104(f) of the Act and § 298.15;
              (9) Predelivery Vessel operating expenses, Vessel insurance premiums and other items which may not be properly capitalized by the owner as costs of the Vessel under GAAP;
              (10) The cost of the condition survey required by § 298.11(f) and all work necessary to meet the standards set forth in that paragraph;

              (11) The cost to the Shipowner of a Vessel which is to be reconstructed, or reconditioned, e.g., cost of acquisition or repair work;
              (12) Generally, any amount payable to the shipyard for early delivery of the Vessel;
              (13) Generally, any amount payable to the manufacturer of the Shipyard Project for early delivery of the equipment to the General Shipyard Facility;
              (14) Predelivery Shipyard Project expenses which may not be properly capitalized by the General Shipyard Facility as costs of the Shipyard Project under GAAP; and

              (15) The cost of major foreign components and other foreign components for which there is no waiver and their assembly when comprising any part of the hull and superstructure of a Vessel.
              (d) Substantiation of Actual Cost. (1) Before we make distribution from the Escrow Fund or Construction Fund (described in §§ 298.33 and 298.34), and prior to our final Actual Cost determination for each Vessel or Shipyard Project, you must submit to us documents substantiating all claimed costs eligible under paragraph (b) of this section or, alternatively, appropriate certification of such costs by an agent who has received our approval.
              (2) These documents may include, but need not be limited to, copies of invoices, change orders, subcontracts, and where we require, statements from independent certified or independent licensed public accountants that the costs for which you seek payment or reimbursement were actually paid or are payable for the construction of a Vessel or Shipyard Project.
              (3) You must summarize, index and arrange these documents according to cost categories by following the directions contained in our forms.
              (e) Escalation as part of Actual Cost. Escalation clauses in construction contracts shall be subject to our approval. After a review of the base contract price and the escalation clauses, we shall, in order to estimate the Actual Cost amount to be stated in the Letter Commitment, add to the approved base contract price the amount of estimated escalation as approved by us. We must subsequently approve the amount of escalation cost you claimed as a component of Actual Cost.
              (f) Monies received in respect of construction. (1) If you or any Person acting on your behalf, from time to time receives moneys due for construction of a Vessel or Shipyard Project (described in the Security Agreement) from the shipbuilder, guarantors, sureties or other Persons, you shall give us written notice of such fact.
              (2) As long as we have not paid the Guarantees, you or other recipient shall promptly deposit these moneys with us to be held by the Depository in accordance with the Depository Agreement.
              (3) We will determine the extent to which Actual Cost is to be reduced by these moneys.
              (4) In no event shall Actual Cost be reduced with respect to payments by the shipyard to a Vessel or Shipyard Project owner of liquidated damages for late delivery of the Vessel or Shipyard Project .
              (5) If we have paid the Guarantees, you or other recipient must promptly pay these moneys, including any liquidated damages, to us for deposit into the Maritime Guaranteed Loans account.
              (g) Depreciated Actual Cost. After a Vessel or Shipyard Project has been delivered or redelivered (in the case of reconstruction or reconditioning), the limitation on the amount of Guarantees will be 75 or 871/2 percent, whichever is applicable, of the Depreciated Actual Cost of the Vessel or Shipyard Project.

              § 298.22
              Amortization of Obligations.
              (a) Generally, after delivery or completion of Shipyard Project, and until maturity of the Obligations, provisions of the Trust Indenture or other part of the Documentation require you to make periodic payment of principal and interest on the Obligations.
              (b) Usually, the payment of principal (amortization) shall be made semi-annually, but in no event, less frequently than on an annual basis, and in either case the amortization shall be in equal payments of principal (level principal), unless we consent to the periodic payment of a constant aggregate amount, comprised of both interest and principal components which are variable in amount (level payment). No other proposed method of amortization will be allowed which would reduce the amount of periodic amortization below that determined under the level principal or level payment basis at any time prior to maturity of the Obligations, except where:
              (1) You can demonstrate to our satisfaction that there will be adequate funds to discharge the Obligations at maturity;

              (2) You establish a fund with the Depository in which you deposit an equal annual amount necessary to redeem the outstanding Obligations at maturity; or
              (3) With regard to Eligible Export Vessels, in accordance with such other terms as we determine to be more favorable and to be compatible with export credit terms offered by foreign governments for the sale of vessels built in foreign shipyards.

              § 298.23
              Refinancing.
              (a) We may approve guarantees of Obligations to be secured by one or more Vessels or a Shipyard Project issued to refinance existing Title XI debt for either Vessels or for Shipyard Project and existing non-Title XI debt, so long as the existing debt has been previously issued for one of the purposes set forth in sections 1104(a)(1) through (4) of the Act. Section 1104 (a) (1) of the Act requires that, if the existing indebtedness was incurred more than one year after the delivery or redelivery of the related Vessel or Shipyard Project, the proceeds of such Obligations will be applied to the construction, reconstruction or reconditioning of other Vessels or Shipyard Project or as provided in § 298.24.
              (b) We shall require any security lien on the Vessel(s) or Shipyard Project to be discharged immediately before we place a Mortgage or other security interest on any of the above assets. You must satisfy all necessary eligibility requirements as set forth in subpart B of this part, including economic soundness.
            
            
              § 298.24
              Financing a Vessel more than a year after delivery.
              (a) We may approve Guarantees for a Vessel which has been delivered (or redelivered in the case of reconstruction or reconditioning of a Vessel) more than one year prior to the issuance of the Guarantees only if:
              (1) The issuance of the Guarantees would otherwise satisfy the requirements of the Act and the regulations in this part, and
              (2) The proceeds of the Obligation financing such existing Vessel are used to finance:
              (i) The construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a different Vessel within one year of that Vessel's delivery or redelivery, as the case may be, or
              (ii) Facilities or equipment pertaining to marine operations. Such facilities or equipment must be of a specialized nature, used principally for servicing vessels and in handling waterborne cargo in the close proximity of the berthing area, excluding over-the-road equipment (other than chassis and containers), permanent or semipermanent structures and real estate, as well as new or less than one year old.
              (b) At the Closing of Guarantees covered by this section, you must deposit the proceeds of the Obligation into an Escrow Fund established to pay for the cost unless you demonstrate to our satisfaction that all such costs have been paid.
            
            
              § 298.25
              Excess interest or other consideration.
              We shall not execute Guarantees if any agreement in the Documentation directly or indirectly provides for:
              (a) The payment to an Obligee of interest, or other compensation for services which have not been performed, in a manner that such compensation or payment is being provided as interest in excess of the rate approved by us; or
              (b) Grants of security to an Obligee in addition to the Guarantees.
            
            
              § 298.26
              Lease payments.
              You must obtain our approval of the amount and conditions of lease or charter hire payments if the payment of principal and interest on Obligations would be dependent, in any way, upon the lease or charter hire payments for a Vessel or Shipyard Project.
            
            
              § 298.27
              Advances.
              (a) In general. (1) In accordance with section 207 and Title XI of the Act, we have the discretion to make or commit to make an advance or payment of funds to, or on behalf of the owner, or operator or directly to any other person or entity for items, including, but not limited to:
              (i) Principal,

              (2) We will make advances or payments only to protect, preserve or improve the collateral held as our security for Title XI debt.
              (3) When requesting an advance, you must demonstrate that:
              (i) Your problems are short term (less than two years) by using market and cash flow analysis and other projections.
              (ii) An advance(s), would assist you over temporary difficulties; and

              (b) Filing requirements. (1) You shall apply for an advance or other payment as early as is reasonably possible.

            Subpart D—Documentation
            
              § 298.30
              Nature and content of Obligations.
              (a) Single page. An Obligation, in the form of a note, bond of any type, or other debt instrument, when engraved, printed or lithographed on a single sheet of paper must include on its face the:
              (1) Name of the Obligor,
              (2) Principal sum,
              (3) Rate of interest,
              (4) Date of maturity, and
              (5) Guarantee of the United States, authenticated by the Indenture Trustee, if any.
              (b) Several pages. If the Obligation is typewritten, printed or reproduced by other means on several pages of paper, the Guarantee of the United States and the authentication certificate of the Indenture Trustee, if any, may appear at the end of the typewritten Obligation.
              (c) Rights and responsibilities. The instrument which is evidence of indebtedness shall also contain all information necessary to apprise the Obligees of their rights and responsibilities including, but not limited to:
              (1) Time and manner for payment of principal and interest,
              (2) Redemptions,
              (3) Default procedure, and
              (4) Notification (in case of registered Obligations) of sale or other transfer of the instruments.
            
            
              § 298.31
              Mortgage.
              (a) In general. Under normal circumstances, a Guarantee shall not be endorsed on any Obligation until we receive satisfactory evidence that we hold a Mortgage in one or more Vessels or a Mortgage or other security interest in the Shipyard Project. During construction of a new Vessel or any Shipyard Project, a security interest may be perfected by a filing under the Uniform Commercial Code.
              (b) Ensuring validity of security interest. In order to ensure that our Mortgages or other security interests are valid and enforceable, we shall require that the Obligor obtain legal opinions, in form and substance satisfactory to us, from independent, outside legal counsel satisfactory to us, including foreign independent outside legal Counsel for Eligible Export Vessels, which opinions shall state, among other things, that the Mortgage or other security interest(s) are valid and enforceable:
              
              (1) In the country in which the Vessel is documented (or, in the case of a security interest, in jurisdictions acceptable to us);
              (2) In the United States; and
              (3) For vessels operating on specified trade routes, in the country or countries involved in this service, unless we determine that those destinations are too numerous, in which case, we will instead require an opinion of foreign validity and enforceability in the Vessel's primary port of operation.
              (c) Alternative forms of security. In the case where a Mortgage or security interest on the financed assets may not be available or enforceable, we will require alternative forms of security.
              (d) Mortgage in our favor. The Security Agreement shall provide that upon delivery of a new Vessel or upon final completion of the Shipyard Project, or at the time Guarantees are issued with respect to an existing Vessel or the Shipyard Project, a Mortgage on the Vessel and a Mortgage or other security interest on the Shipyard Project will be executed in our favor, unless we determine that a Mortgage or a security interest is not available or enforceable in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
              (e) Filing. You must file the Mortgage with the United States Coast Guard's National Vessel Documentation Center. You must file the Mortgage for an Eligible Export Vessel with the proper foreign authorities. For assets of a General Shipyard Facility, you must file a Mortgage and security interest with the proper authorities within the appropriate state for recording. After you have recorded the Mortgage, you must deliver to us the Mortgage and evidence of the filing of the security interest.
              (f) Mortgage secured by multiple Vessels. (1) When two or more Vessels are to be security for Guarantees, the Security Agreement may provide that one Mortgage relating to all the Vessels (Fleet Mortgage) shall be executed, perfected and delivered to us by the Obligor.
              (2) If the Fleet Mortgage relates to undelivered Vessels, the Fleet Mortgage will be executed upon delivery of the first vessel. At the time of each subsequent Vessel delivery, the Obligor shall execute a supplement to the Fleet Mortgage which makes that Vessel subject to our Mortgage lien.
              (3) The Fleet Mortgage shall provide that payment by the Obligor of the entire amount of Obligations covered or to be covered by Guarantees shall be required to discharge the Fleet Mortgage, regardless of the amount of the Secretary's Note or Notes issued and outstanding at the time of execution and delivery of the Fleet Mortgage or the number of Vessels covered by the Fleet Mortgage.
              (4) The discharge date of the Fleet Mortgage shall be the maturity date of the Secretary's Note. We may require, as authorized by section 1104(c)(2) of the Act, such payments of principal prior to maturity (redemptions), regarding all related Obligations, as deemed necessary to maintain adequate security for the Guarantees.
              (5) Each Fleet Mortgage shall provide that in the event of constructive total loss, requisition of title or sale of any Vessel covered by the Fleet Mortgage, indebtedness represented by the Obligations shall be paid, unless we otherwise determine that there remains adequate security for the Guarantees, and the Vessel shall be discharged from the Mortgage lien.
              (g) Adequacy of collateral. (1) Under normal circumstances, a First Preferred Mortgage on the Vessel(s) or Shipyard Project will be adequate security for the Guarantees.
              (2) If, however, we determine that the Mortgage on the Vessel(s) or Shipyard Project is not sufficient to provide adequate security, as a condition to approving the Letter Commitment or processing the application, we may require additional collateral, such as a mortgage(s) on other vessel(s) or Shipyard Project or on other assets, special escrow funds, pledges of stock, charters, contracts, notes, letters of credit, accounts receivable assignments, and guarantees.
            
            
              § 298.32
              Required provisions in documentation.

              (a) Performance under shipyard and related contracts. Generally, shipyard and related contracts must contain provisions for:
              
              (1) Furnishing by the shipyard or contractor of the Shipyard Project of satisfactory insurance and a satisfactory performance bond where Obligations are issued during the construction period, except that if the shipyard or contractor of the Shipyard Project demonstrates to our satisfaction that it has sufficient financial resources and operational capacity to complete the project, posting of a bond will not be required;
              (2) Allowing access to the Vessel or Shipyard Project, as well as all related work projects being performed by the contractor and subcontractors, to our representative, at all reasonable times, to inspect performance of the work and to observe trials and other tests for the purpose of determining that the Vessel or Shipyard Project is being constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned in accordance with contract plans and specifications approved by us;
              (3) Submitting to us, upon request, one set of shipyard plans, in form and substance satisfactory to us, for the Vessel or Shipyard Project as built;
              (4) Making periodic payments for the work in accordance with an agreed schedule, submitted by the shipyard or contractor, as appropriate, in a form acceptable to us, based on percentage of completion, after such percentage and satisfactory performance are certified by the Obligor, shipyard or contractor, as appropriate, and our representative as to each payment;
              (5) Prohibiting the use of proceeds from the sale of Obligations for the payment of work performed outside the shipyard, unless we consent in writing to such use; and
              (6) Requiring that all components of the hull and superstructure of a U.S.-documented Vessel and an Eligible Export Vessel shall be assembled in the United States.
              (7) If Obligation will not be issued during the construction period of the Vessel and Shipyard Project, requiring that shipyard-related contracts shall generally include the provisions specified in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(6) of this section.
              (b) Assignments and general covenants from Obligor to us. The Obligor shall assign rights and shall covenant with us, as we require, including, but not limited to, the following:
              (1) Assignment of all or part of the right, title and interest under the construction contract and related contracts, except those rights expressly reserved therein by the Obligor relating to such things as patent infringement and liquidated damages;
              (2) Assignment of rights to receive all moneys which from time to time become due regarding Vessel or Shipyard Project construction;
              (3) Assignment, where applicable, of all or a part of the bareboat charter, time charter, contracts of affreightment or other agreements relating to the use of the Vessel or Shipyard Project and all hire payable to the Obligor, and delivery to us of required consents by appropriate parties to any such assignments;
              (4) Covenants relating to the filing of satisfactory evidence of continuing United States citizenship, in accordance with 46 CFR part 355, with the exception of Eligible Export Vessels and shipyards with Shipyard Projects; warranty of Vessel or Shipyard Project title free from all liens other than those specifically excepted; maintaining United States documentation of the Vessel or documentation under the laws of a country other than the United States with regard to an Eligible Export Vessel; compliance with the provisions of 46 U.S.C. 31301-31343, except that Eligible Export Vessels shall comply with the definition of a “preferred mortgage” in 46 U.S.C. 31301(6)(B), requiring, among other things, that the Mortgage shall comply with the mortgage laws of the foreign country where the Vessel is documented and shall have been registered under those laws in a public register; Notice of Mortgage, payment of all taxes (except if being contested in good faith); annual financial statements audited by independent certified or independent licensed public accountant.
              (5) Covenants to keep records of construction costs paid by or for the Obligor's account and to furnish us with a detailed statement of those costs, distinguishing between:

              (i) Items paid or obligated to be paid, attested to by independent certified public accountants unless otherwise verified by us; and
              (ii) Costs of American and foreign materials (including services) in the hull and superstructure.
              (6) Covenants to maintain Marine and War Risk Hull and Machinery insurance on the Vessel or Eligible Export Vessel in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding Obligations or up to the full commercial value of the Vessel or Eligible Export Vessel, whichever is greater; Marine and War Risk Protection and Indemnity insurance; Interim War Risk Binders for Hull and Machinery, and Protection and Indemnity coverages underwritten by us as authorized by Title XII of the Act; and such additional insurance as may be required by us. All insurance required to be maintained shall be placed with the United States Government and American and/or British (and/or other foreign, if permitted by us by prior written notice) insurance companies, underwriters' associations or underwriting funds approved by us through marine insurance brokers and/or underwriting agents approved by us. All insurance required to be maintained shall be placed under the latest (at the time of issue) forms of American Institute of Marine Underwriters policies approved by us and/or under such other forms of policies which we may approve in writing and/or policies issued by or for us insuring the Vessel or Eligible Export Vessel against the usual risks provided for under such forms, including such amounts of increase value or other forms of “that total loss only” insurance permitted by the Hull and Machinery insurance policies;
              (7) Collateralize other debt due to us under other Title XI financings;
              (8) Covenants to maintain shipyard insurance on the Shipyard Project in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding Obligations or up to the full commercial value of the Shipyard Project, whichever is greater, and such additional insurance as may be required by us; and

              (9) Covenants to maintain additional types of insurance as may be required by us with respect to Eligible Export Vessels, i.e. political risk insurance, to cover such items as the political, financial, and/or economic risk in a foreign country.
            
            
              § 298.33
              Escrow fund.
              (a) Escrow Fund Deposits. At the time of the sale of the Obligations, the Obligor shall deposit with the Depository in an escrow fund (the “Escrow Fund”) all of the proceeds of that sale unless the Obligor is entitled to withdraw funds under paragraph (b) of this section. The Obligor must also deposit into the Escrow Fund on the Closing date an amount equal to six months interest at the rate borne by the Obligations, unless we find the existence of adequate consideration or accept other consideration in lieu of the interest deposit.
              (b) Escrow Fund Withdrawals. You, as Obligor, may make a written request for us to disburse funds from the Escrow Fund. Within a reasonable time thereafter, we shall disburse directly to the Indenture Trustee, any Paying Agent for such Obligations, or any other Person entitled to payment any amount which you are obligated to pay or have paid, on account of the items and amounts or any other item approved by us, provided that we are satisfied with the accuracy and completeness of the information contained in the following submissions:
              (1) A responsible officer of the Obligor shall deliver an officer's certificate, in form and substance satisfactory to us, stating that:
              (i) There is no default under the construction contract or the Security Agreement;
              (ii) There have been no occurrences which have or would adversely and materially affect the condition of the Vessel, its hull or any of its component parts, or the Shipyard Project;
              (iii) The amounts of the request are in accordance with the construction contract including the approved disbursement schedule and each item in these amounts is properly included in our approved estimate of Actual Cost;

              (iv) With respect to the request, once the contractor is paid there will be no liens or encumbrances on the applicable Vessel, its hull or component parts, or the Shipyard Project for which the withdrawal is being requested except for those already approved by us; and
              
              (v) If the Vessel or Shipyard Project has already been delivered or completed, it is in class, if required, and is being maintained in the highest and best condition. The Obligor must also attach an officer's certificate of the shipyard and other general contractors, in form and substance satisfactory to us, stating that there are no liens or encumbrances as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section and attaching the invoices and receipts supporting each proposed withdrawal to our satisfaction.
              (2) No payment or reimbursement under this section shall be made:
              (i) To any Person until the total amount paid by or for the account of the Obligor from sources other than the proceeds of such Obligations equals at least 121/2 percent or 25 percent as applicable, of the Actual Cost of the Vessel or Shipyard Project is made;
              (ii) To the Obligor which would have the effect of reducing the total amounts paid by the Obligor pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section; or
              (iii) To any Person on account of items, amounts or increases representing changes and extras or owner furnished equipment, if any, unless such items, amounts and increases shall have been previously approved by us; provided, however, that when the amount guaranteed by us equals 75 percent or less of the Actual Cost and the Obligor demonstrates to our satisfaction the ability to pay in the remaining 25 percent, or more, then after the initial 121/2 percent of Actual Cost has been paid by or on behalf of the Obligor for such Vessel or completed Shipyard Project and up to 371/2 percent of Actual Cost has been withdrawn from the Escrow Fund for such Vessel or Shipyard Project, the Obligor must pay the remaining Obligor's equity of at least 121/2 percent (as determined by us) before additional monies can be withdrawn from the Escrow Fund relating to such Vessel or Shipyard Project.
              (3) We will not be required to make any disbursement except out of the cash available in the Escrow Fund. If any sale or payment on maturity results in a loss in the principal amount of the Escrow Fund invested in securities so sold or matured, the requested disbursement from the Escrow Fund shall be reduced by an amount equal to such loss, and the Obligor must pay to any Person entitled thereto, the balance of the requested disbursement from the Obligor's funds other than the proceeds of such Obligations.
              (4) If we assume the Obligor's rights and duties under the Obligations or we pay the Guarantees, all amounts in the Escrow Fund (including realized income which has not yet been paid to the Obligor), shall be paid to us and be credited against any amounts due or to become due to us under the Security Agreement and the Secretary's Note.
              (5) Other rights and duties with respect to withdrawals from the Escrow Fund shall be set out in the closing documentation in form and substance satisfactory to us.
              (c) Investment and liquidation of the Escrow Fund. We may invest the Escrow Fund in obligations of the United States. We will deposit amounts in the Escrow Fund into an account with the U.S. Treasury Department and upon agreement with the Obligor, shall deliver to the U.S. Treasury Department instructions for the investment, reinvestment and liquidation of the Escrow Fund. We will have no liability to the Obligor for acting in accordance with such instructions.
              (d) Income on the Escrow Fund. Unless there is an existing default, any income realized on the Escrow Fund shall be paid to the Obligor upon our receipt of such income.
              (e) Termination date of the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall terminate 90 days after the delivery date of the last Vessel or Shipyard Project covered by the Security Agreement (the “Termination Date”). In the event that on such date the payment of the full amount of the aggregate Actual Cost of all of the Vessels or Shipyard Project has not been made or the amounts with respect to such Actual Cost are not then due and payable, then we and the Obligor by written agreement shall extend the Termination Date for such period as we and the Obligor shall determine is sufficient to allow for such contingencies. Any amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund on the Termination Date which are in excess of 871/2 percent or 75 percent of Actual Cost, as the case may be, shall be applied to retire a pro rata portion of the Obligations.

              § 298.35
              Title XI Reserve Fund and Financial Agreement.
              (a) Purpose. In order to provide us with further security and to ensure payment of the interest and principal due on the Obligations, we will require the Company to enter into a Title XI Reserve Fund and Financial Agreement (Agreement) at the first Closing at which the Company issues Obligations. We may waive or modify provisions of the Agreement based on our evaluation of the aggregate security for the Guarantees.
              (b) Financial covenants. There will be two sets of covenants. One set of covenants will be imposed regardless of the Company's financial condition (primary covenants). The other set of covenants will be imposed only if the Company does not meet specific financial conditions (supplemental covenants). The primary and supplemental covenants are to be set forth in the Agreement. Covenants shall be imposed on the Company as follows:
              (1) Primary covenants. So long as Guarantees are in effect the Company shall not, without our prior written consent:
              (i) Make any distribution of earnings, except as may be permitted as follows:
              (A) From retained earnings in an amount specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section, provided that, in the fiscal year in which the distribution of earnings is made there is no operating loss to the date of such payment of such distribution of earnings, and there was no operating loss in the immediately preceding three fiscal years, or there was a one-year operating loss during the immediately preceding three fiscal years, but such loss was not in the immediately preceding fiscal year, and there was positive net income for the three year period;
              (B) If distributions of earnings may not be made under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section, a distribution can be made in an amount equal to the total operating net income for the immediately preceding three fiscal year period, provided that:
              (1) There were no two successive years of operating losses;
              (2) There is no operating loss to the date of such distribution in the fiscal year in which such distribution is made; and
              (3) The distribution of earnings made would not exceed an amount specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section;
              (C) Distributions of earnings may be made from earnings of prior years in an aggregate amount equal to 40 percent of the Company's total net income after tax for each of the prior years, less any distributions that were made in such years; or the aggregate of the Company's total net income after tax for such prior years, provided that, after making such distribution, the Company's Long-Term Debt does not exceed its Net Worth. In computing net income for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C), extraordinary gains, such as gains from the sale of assets, will be excluded;
              (ii) Enter into any service, management or operating agreement for the operation of the Vessel or the Shipyard Project (excluding husbanding type agreements), or appoint or designate a managing or operating agent for the operation of the Vessel or the Shipyard Project (excluding husbanding agents) unless approved by us;
              (iii) Sell, mortgage, transfer, or demise charter the Vessel or the Shipyard Project or any assets to any non-Related Party except as permitted in paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section or sell, mortgage, transfer, or demise charter the Vessel or any assets to a Related Party, unless such transaction is at a fair market value as determined by an independent appraiser acceptable to us, and is a total cash transaction;
              (iv) Enter into any agreement for both sale and leaseback of the same assets so sold unless the proceeds from such sale are at least equal to the fair market value of the property sold;

              (v) Guarantee, or otherwise become liable for the obligations of any other Person, except with respect to any undertakings as to the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee, except endorsement for deposit of checks and other negotiable instruments acquired in the ordinary course of business and except as otherwise permitted in this section;
              (vi) Directly or indirectly embark on any new enterprise or business activity not directly connected with the business of shipping or other activity in which the Company is actively engaged;

              (vii) Enter into any merger or consolidation or convey, sell, demise charter, or otherwise transfer, or dispose of any portion of its properties or assets (any and all of which acts are encompassed within the words “sale” or “sold” as used in this section), provided that, the Company will not be deemed to have sold such properties or assets if the net book value of the aggregate of all the assets sold by the Company during any period of 12 consecutive calendar months does not exceed ten percent of the total net book value of all of the Company's assets; the Company retains the proceeds of the sale of assets for use in accordance with the Company's regular business activities; and the sale is not otherwise prohibited by paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. The Company may not consummate such sale without our prior written consent if the Company has not, prior to the time of such sale, submitted to us, as required, its most recently audited financial statements referred to in § 298.42(a) and any attempt to consummate a sale absent such approval will be null and void ab initio.
              
              (2) Supplemental Covenants which may become applicable. Unless, after giving effect to such transaction or transactions, during any fiscal year of the Company, the Company's Working Capital is equal to at least one dollar, the Company's Long-Term Debt does not exceed two times the Company's Net Worth and the Company's Net Worth is at least the amount specified by us, the Company shall not, without our prior written consent:
              (i) Withdraw any capital;
              (ii) Redeem any share capital or convert any of the same into debt;
              (iii) Pay any dividend (except dividends payable in capital stock of the Company);
              (iv) Make any loan or advance (except advances to cover current expenses of the Company), either directly or indirectly, to any stockholder, director, officer, or employee of the Company, or to any other Related Party;
              (v) Make any investments in the securities of any Related Party;
              (vi) Prepay in whole or in part any indebtedness to any stockholder, director, officer, or employee of the Company, or to any Related Party, which has a stated maturity of more than one year from such date;
              (vii) Increase any direct employee compensation (as defined in this paragraph) paid to any employee in excess of $100,000 per annum; nor increase any direct employee compensation which is already in excess of $100,000 per annum; nor initially employ or re-employ any person at a direct employee compensation rate in excess of $100,000 per annum; provided, however, that beginning with January 1, 2000 the $100,000 limit may be increased annually based on the previous years' closing Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “direct employee compensation” is the total amount of any wage, salary, bonus commission, or other form of direct payment to any employee from all companies with guarantees under the Act as reported to the Internal Revenue Service for any fiscal year.
              (viii) Acquire any fixed assets other than those required for the maintenance of the Company's existing assets, including normal maintenance and operation of any vessel or vessels owned or chartered by the Company;
              (ix) Either enter into or become liable (directly or indirectly) under charters and leases (having a term of six months or more) for the payment of charter hire and rent on all such charters and leases which have annual payments aggregating in excess of an amount specified by us;

              (x) Pay any indebtedness subordinated to the Obligations or to any other Title XI obligations;
              
              (xi) Create, assume, incur, or in any manner become liable for any indebtedness, except current liabilities, or short term loans, incurred or assumed in the ordinary course of business as such business presently exists;
              (xii) Make any investment whether by acquisition of stock or indebtedness, or by loan, advance, transfer of property, capital contribution, guarantee of indebtedness or otherwise, in any Person, other than obligations of the United States, bank deposits or investments in securities of the character permitted for monies in the Title XI Reserve Fund; and,
              (xiii) Create, assume, permit or suffer to exist or continue any mortgage, lien, charge or encumbrance upon, or pledge of, or subject to the prior payment of any indebtedness, any of its property or assets, real or personal, tangible or intangible, whether now owned or thereafter acquired, or own or acquire, or agree to acquire, title to any property of any kind subject to or upon a chattel mortgage or conditional sales agreement or other title retention agreement, except loans, mortgages and indebtedness guaranteed by us under Title XI of the Act or related to the construction of a vessel approved for Title XI by us, and liens incurred in the ordinary course of business as such business presently exists.
              (c) Title XI Reserve Fund Net Income. The Agreement shall provide that within 105 days after the end of its accounting year, the Company will compute its net income attributable to the operation of the Vessel(s) that were constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned or refinanced with Title XI financing assistance (Title XI Reserve Fund Net Income). The computation utilizes a ratio expressed as a percentage, and applies this percentage to the Company's total net income after taxes. The numerator of the ratio is be the total original capitalized cost of all Company Vessels (whether leased or owned) which were constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned or refinanced with the assistance of Guarantees. The denominator shall be the total original capitalized cost of all the Company's fixed assets. In the case of Shipyard Project, the Agreement shall provide that within 105 days after the end of its accounting year, the Company shall submit its audited financial statements showing its net cash flow in a manner acceptable to us, in lieu of any other computation of Reserve Fund Net Income specified in this section for Vessels. The net income after taxes, computed in accordance with GAAP, will be adjusted as follows:
              (1) The depreciation expense applicable to the accounting year shall be added back.
              (2) There shall be subtracted:
              (i) An amount equal to the principal amount of debt required to be paid or redeemed, and actually paid or redeemed by the Company (other than from the Title XI Reserve Fund) during the year; and
              (ii) The principal amount of Obligations retired or paid (as defined in the Security Agreement), prepaid or redeemed, in excess of the required redemptions or payments which may be used by the Company as a credit against future required redemptions or other required payments with respect to the Obligations.
              (d) Deposits. Unless the Company, as of the close of its accounting year, was subject to and in compliance with the financial requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Company shall make one or more deposits to us to be held by the Depository (the Title XI Reserve Fund), as further provided for in the Depository Agreement. The amount of deposit as to any year, or period less than a full year, where applicable, will be determined as follows:
              (1) Fifty percent of the Title XI Reserve Fund Net Income, less an amount equal to 10% of the Company's total original equity investment in the Vessel or Vessels, (if the Company is the owner of the assets), will be deposited into the Title XI Reserve Fund.
              (2) In the case of Shipyard Project, the shipyard shall make a deposit at two percent of its net cash flow, as defined by GAAP, and as shown on its audited financial statements.

              (3) Any additional amounts that may be required pursuant to the Security Agreement or any other agreement in the documentation to which the Company is a party.
              
              (4) Any additional amounts that may be required, pursuant to provisions of the Security Agreement or any other agreement in the documentation to which the Company is a party.
              (5) Irrespective of the Company's deposit requirement, as stated in paragraphs (d) (1) through (4) of this section, the Company will not be required to make any deposits into the Title XI Reserve Fund if any of the following events will have occurred:
              (i) The Company will have discharged the Obligations and related Secretary's Note and will have paid other sums secured under the Security Agreement and Preferred Mortgage;
              (ii) All Guarantees with respect to outstanding Obligations will have terminated pursuant to the provisions of the Security Agreements, other than by reason of payment of the Guarantees; or
              (iii) The amount in the Title XI Reserve Fund, (including any securities at market value), is equal to, or in excess of 50 percent of the principal amount of outstanding Obligations.
              (e) Fund in lieu of Title XI Reserve Fund. If the Company has established a Capital Construction Fund (CCF), pursuant to section 607 of the Act, whether interim or permanent, at any time when a deposit would otherwise be required to be made into the Title XI Reserve Fund, and the Company elects to make such deposits to the CCF, the Company must enter into an agreement, satisfactory to us, providing that all such deposits of assets therein will be security (CCF Security Amount) to the United States in lieu of the Title XI Reserve Fund. The deposit requirements of the Title XI Reserve Fund and Financial Agreement will be deemed satisfied by deposits of equal amounts in the CCF, and withdrawal of the CCF Security Amount will be subject to our prior written consent. If, for any reason, the CCF terminates prior to the payment of the Obligations, the Secretary's Note and all other amounts due under or secured by the Security Agreement or Mortgage, the CCF Security Amount will be deposited or redeposited in the Title XI Reserve Fund.

              § 298.36
              Guarantee Fee.
              (a) Rates in general. (1) For annual periods, beginning with the date of the Security Agreement and prior to the delivery date of a Vessel or Shipyard Project, we shall charge a Guarantee Fee set at a rate of not less than 1/4 of 1 percent and not more than 1/2 of 1 percent of the excess of the average principal amount of the Obligations estimated to be outstanding during the annual periods covered by said Guarantee Fee over the average principal amount, if any, on deposit in the Escrow Fund during said annual period (Average Principal Amount of Obligations Outstanding).
              (2) For annual periods beginning with the delivery date of a Vessel or Shipyard Project, the Guarantee Fee shall be set at an annual rate of not less than 1/2 of 1 percent and not more than 1 percent of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations Outstanding during the annual periods covered by the Guarantee Fee. You will be responsible for payment of the Guarantee Fee.
              (b) Rate calculation. (1) The Guarantee Fee rate generally shall vary inversely with the ratio of Equity to Long-Term Debt (Variable Rate) of the Person who we consider to be the primary source of credit in the transaction (Credit Source), for example,
              (i) The long term time charterer (where the charter hire represents the source of payment of interest and principal with respect to the Obligations),
              (ii) The guarantor of the Obligations,
              (iii) The Obligor, or
              (iv) The bareboat charterer.
              (2) Where the Variable Rate is used, we may make such adjustments to the computation of Equity and Long-Term Debt considered necessary to reflect more accurately the financial condition of the Credit Source.
              (3) We shall base our determination of Equity and Long-Term Debt on information contained in forms or statements on file with us prior to the date on which the Guarantee Fee is to be paid.

              (4) With our consent, you may include in Equity and exclude from Long-Term Debt, any subordinated indebtedness representing loans from any credit source.
              
              (5) We may establish a fixed rate or other method of calculation of the Guarantee Fee, upon an evaluation of the aggregate security for the Guarantees.
              (c) Variable Rate prior to Vessel or Shipyard Project. For annual periods beginning prior to the delivery date of a Vessel or Shipyard Project being constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned, the Guarantee Fee shall be determined as follows:
              (1) If the Equity is less than 15 percent of the Long-Term Debt, the Guarantee Fee rate shall be 1/2 of 1 percent of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations Outstanding during the annual period covered by the Guarantee Fee.
              (2) If the Equity is at least 15 percent of the Long-Term Debt, but less than the Long-Term Debt, the Guarantee Fee rate shall be 3/8 of 1 percent of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations Outstanding during the annual period covered by the Guarantee Fee.
              (3) If the Equity is equal to or exceeds the Long-Term Debt, the Guarantee Fee rate shall be 1/4 of 1 percent of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations Outstanding during the annual period covered by the Guarantee Fee.
              (d) Variable Rate after Vessel or Shipyard Project delivery or completion. For annual periods beginning on or after the Vessel or Shipyard Project delivery date, the Guarantee Fee shall be determined as follows:
              (1) If the Equity is less than 15 percent of the Long-Term Debt, the Guarantee Fee rate shall be 1 percent of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations Outstanding during the annual period covered by the Guarantee Fee.
              (2) If the Equity is at least 15 percent of the Long-Term Debt but less than 60 percent of the Long-Term Debt, the Guarantee Fee rate shall be 3/4 of 1 percent of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations Outstanding during the annual period covered by the Guarantee Fee.
              (3) If the Equity is at least 60 percent of the Long-Term Debt, but less than the Long-Term Debt, the Guarantee Fee rate shall be 5/8 of 1 percent of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations outstanding during the annual period covered by the Guarantee Fee.
              (4) If the Equity is equal to or exceeds the Long-Term Debt, the Guarantee Fee rate shall be 1/2 of 1 percent of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations outstanding during the annual period covered by the Guarantee Fee.
              (e) Payment of Guarantee Fee. (1) The Guarantee Fee covering the full period of the stated maturity of the Obligations commencing with the date of the Security Agreement shall be paid to us concurrently with the execution and delivery of said Agreement. The project's entire Guarantee Fee payment shall be made by you to us in an amount equal to the sum of the present value of the separate products obtained by applying the pertinent pre or post delivery Guarantee Fee rate or rates to the projected amount of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations Outstanding for each year of the stated maturity of the Obligations. In calculating the present value used in determining the amount of the Guarantee Fee to be paid, we shall use a discount rate based on information contained in the President's most recently submitted budget.
              (2) The Guarantee Fee may be included in Actual Cost, is eligible to be financed, and is non-refundable.
              (f) Proration of Guarantee Fee. The Guarantee Fee shall be prorated where a Vessel delivery is scheduled to occur during the annual period with respect to which payment of said Guarantee Fee is being made, as follows:
              (1) Undelivered Vessel. If the Guarantee Fee relates to an undelivered Vessel, the predelivery rate is applicable to the Average Principal Amount of Obligations Outstanding for the period from the date of the Security Agreement to the delivery date, and the delivered Vessel rate is applicable for the balance of the annual period in which the delivery occurs.

              (2) Multiple Vessels. If the Guarantee Fee relates to more than one Vessel, the amount of outstanding Obligations will be allocated to each Vessel in the manner prescribed in § 298.33(d), and an amount shall be determined for each Vessel by using the rate that is applicable under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. The Guarantee Fee shall be the aggregate of the amounts calculated for each Vessel.
            
            
              § 298.37
              Examination and audit.
              (a)(1) We shall have the right to examine and audit the books, records (including original logs, cargo manifests and similar records) and books of account, which pertain directly to the project, of the Obligor, bareboat charterer, time charterer or any other Person who has an agreement with respect to control of, or a financial interest in, a Vessel or Shipyard Project, as well as records of a Related Party and domestic agents connected with such Persons, and shall have full, free and complete access to these items at all reasonable times.
              (2) We shall have the right to full, free and complete access, at all reasonable times, to each Vessel or Shipyard Project for which Guarantees are in force.
              (3) When a Vessel is in port or undergoing repairs, we may make photostatic or other copies of any books, records and other relevant documents or papers being examined or audited.
              (b) The Person in control of the premises where we conduct the examination or audit must furnish, without charge, adequate office space and other facilities that we reasonably require in performing the examination, audit or inspection.
            
            
              § 298.38
              Partnership agreements and limited liability company agreements.
              Partnership and limited liability company agreements must be in form and substance satisfactory to us prior to any Guarantee Closing, especially relating, but not limited to:
              (a) Duration of the entity;
              (b) Adequate partnership or limited liability company funding requirements and mechanisms;
              (c) Dissolution of the entity and withdrawal of a general partner or member;
              (d) The termination, amendment, or other modification of the entity without our prior written consent; and
              (e) Distribution of funds or ownership interest.
            
            
              § 298.39
              Exemptions.
              We may exempt an applicant from any requirement of this part, unless required by statute or other regulations, in exceptional cases, on written findings that:
              (a) The case materially involves factors not considered in the promulgation of this part;
              (b)(1) A national emergency makes it necessary to approve the exemption, or
              (2) The exemption will substantially relieve the financial liability of the United States;
              (c) The exemption will not substantially impact effective regulation of the Title XI program, consistent with the objectives of this part;
              (d) The exemption will not be unjustly discriminatory; and
              (e) For Eligible Export Vessels, such exemption would assist in creating financing terms that would be compatible with export credit terms for the sale of vessels built in shipyards other than those in the United States.
            
          
          
            Subpart E—Defaults and Remedies, Reporting Requirements, Applicability of Regulations
            
              § 298.40
              Defaults.
              (a) In General. Provisions concerning the existence and declaration of a default and demand for payment of the Obligations (described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section) shall be included in the Security Agreement and in other parts of the Documentation.
              (b) Principal and interest Payment Default. Unless we have assumed the Obligor's rights and duties under the Obligation and agreements and have made any payments in default under terms in the Obligation or related agreements, the following procedures regarding principal and interest payment default shall apply:
              (1) No demand shall be made for payment under the Guarantees unless the default shall have continued for 30 days (Payment Default).

              (2) After the expiration of said 30-day period, demand for payment of all amounts due under the Guarantees must be made no later than 60 days afterward.
              
              (3) After demand for payment is made by or on behalf of the Obligees, we shall make payment under the Guarantees, except if we determine that a Payment Default has not occurred or that such Payment Default has been remedied prior to demand being made.
              (c) Security Default. If a default occurs under the Security Agreement which is other than a Payment Default (Security Default), section 1105(b) of the Act allows us, in our sole discretion, to declare such default a Security Default, and we may notify the Obligee or agent of the Obligee of such Security Default, stating that demand for payment under the Guarantees must be made no later than 60 days after the date of such notification.
              (d) Payment of Guarantees. If we receive notice of demand for payment of the Guarantees, we shall, no later than 30 days after the date of such demand (provided that we shall not have, upon such terms as may be provided in the Obligations or related agreements, prior to that demand, assumed the Obligor's rights and duties under the Obligation and agreements and shall have made any payments in default), make payment to the Obligees, Indenture Trustee or any other agent of the unpaid principal amount of Obligations and unpaid interest accrued and accruing thereon up to, but not including, the date of payment.
            
            
              § 298.41
              Remedies after default.
              (a) In general. The Security Agreement or other parts of the Documentation shall include provisions governing remedies after a default, which relate to our rights and duties, the rights and duties of the Obligor, and other appropriate Persons.
              (b) Action by the Secretary. (1) We may take the Vessel or Shipyard Project and hold, lease, charter, operate or use the Vessel or Shipyard Project, accounting only for the net profits to the Obligor after a default has occurred and is continuing and before making payment required under the Guarantees.
              (2) After making payment required under the Guarantees, we may initiate or otherwise participate in legal proceedings of every type, or take any other action considered appropriate, to protect rights and interests granted to us under:
              (i) Sections 1105(c), 1105(e) and 1108(b) of the Act,
              (ii) The Security Agreement,
              (iii) Other applicable provisions of law, and
              (iv) The Documentation.
              (c) Security proceeds to Secretary. Our interest in proceeds realized from the disposition of or collection regarding the security granted to us in consideration for the Guarantees (except all proceeds from the sale, requisition, charter or other disposition of property purchased by us at a foreclosure or other public sale, which proceeds shall belong to and vest exclusively in us), shall be an amount equal to, but not in excess of, the sum of (in order of priority of application of the proceeds):
              (1) All moneys due and unpaid and secured by the Mortgage or Security Agreement;
              (2) All advances, including interest thereon, by us, under the Security Agreement and all our reasonable charges and expenses;
              (3) The accrued and unpaid interest on the Secretary's Note;
              (4) The accrued and unpaid balance of the principal of the Secretary's Note; and
              (5) To the extent of any collaterization by the Obligor of other debt due to us from the Obligor under other Title XI financings, such other Title XI debt.
              (d) Security proceeds to Obligor. You shall be entitled to the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of security, described in paragraph (c) of this section, if and to the extent that the proceeds realized are in excess of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section.
            
            
              § 298.42
              Reporting requirements—financial statements.
              (a) In general. The financial statements of the Company shall be audited at least annually, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, by independent certified public accountants licensed to practice by the regulatory authority of a State or other political subdivision of the United States or, licensed public accountants licensed to practice by the regulatory authority or other political subdivision of the United States on or before December 31, 1970.
              (b) Eligible Export Vessels. In the case of Eligible Export Vessels, the accounts of the Company shall be audited at least annually, and unless otherwise agreed to by us, we shall require that the financial statements be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, by accountants as described in paragraph (a) of this section or by independent public accountants licensed to practice by the regulatory authority or other political subdivision of a foreign country, provided such accountants are satisfactory to us. The accountants performing such audits may be the regular auditors of the Company.
              (c) Reports of Company and other Persons. Except as we require otherwise, the Company must file a semiannual financial report and an annual financial report, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, with us as specified in the Documentation. You must include:
              (1) The balance sheet and a statement of paid-in-capital and retained earnings at the close of the required reporting period,
              (2) A statement of income for the period, and
              (3) Any other statement that we consider necessary to accurately reflect the Company's financial condition and the results of its operations.
              (d) Required form. We will specify in a letter to the Company the form required for reporting and the number of copies that you must submit
              (e) Other Persons. We may after providing the Company notice, also require the Company to submit financial statements of any other Person, directly or indirectly participating in the project, if the financial condition of that Person affects our security for the Guarantees.

              (g) Public accountant's report. The annual report will be accompanied by the public accountant's report based on an audit of the company's financial statements. We may require an audit by the public accountants of the financial statements contained in the company's semiannual report. We also may require certification of the semiannual report by the accountants. Where independent certification is not required, a responsible corporate officer will attach a certification that such report is based on the accounting records and, to the best of that officer's knowledge and belief, is accurate and complete.
              (h) Leveraged lease financing. If the method of financing involved is a leveraged lease financing, or a trust is the owner of the Vessels, we may modify the requirements for annual and semiannual accounting reports of the Obligor accordingly.
              (i) Letter of confirmation. The Company must furnish, along with its financial report, a letter of confirmation issued by its insurance underwriter(s) or broker(s) that the Company has paid premiums on insurance applicable to the preservation, protection and operation of the asset, which information must state the term for which the insurance is in force.

            (a) The information collected under these instructions will be released to recognized search-and-rescue authorities, to make advance notice to the U.S. Coast Guard of arrival in U.S. ports as required by certain sections of 33 CFR.

            (b) AMVER reports will remain voluntary for foreign ships unless otherwise directed by their governments, and will be kept strictly confidential by the U.S. Coast Guard. Information collected from such foreign ships will not be forwarded to MARAD.

            (c) any information provided in the remarks line will be stored in AMVER's automatic data processing system for later review. However, no immediate action will be taken, nor will the information be routinely passed to other organizations. The remarks line cannot be used as a substitute for sending information to other search-and-rescue authorities or organizations. However, AMVER will, at the request of other SAR authorities, forward remarks line information to the requesting agencies.

Such penalty shall constitute a lien upon the vessel, and such vessel may be libeled in the district court of the United States in which the vessel may be found.

            Subpart A—General
            
              § 308.1
              Eligibility for vessel insurance.
              Any vessel within one of the following categories shall be eligible for insurance, but shall remain eligible only while meeting the qualifications criteria in one of said categories. An eligible vessel is not insured unless and until an application is submitted as required in subpart B, C, or D of this part 308 and the Maritime Administrator, Department of Transportation, (Maritime Administrator) Maritime Administration (MARAD), approves said application.
              (a) A vessel registered, enrolled, or licensed under the laws of the United States of America (United States); any undocumented vessel owned or chartered by or made available to the United States or any department or agency thereof; any tug or barge or other watercraft (documented under the laws of the United States, or undocumented) owned by a citizen of the United States and used in essential water transportation; and United States citizen-owned watercraft used in the fishing trade or industry, except when used exclusively in or for sport fishing.
              (b) Any vessel, other than a vessel described in paragraph (a) of this section determined by the Maritime Administrator to be engaged in the national defense or the national economy of the United States and subject to an unqualified Contract of Commitment with the United States in a form required by the Maritime Administrator, and which is:
              (1) Owned by a United States corporation, or a foreign corporation in which a majority of the stock is owned and controlled by a citizen or citizens of the United States, whether direct or through intervening corporations, foreign or domestic. Where such intervening corporations are foreign, the ultimate majority ownership and control of the stock of such corporations must be vested in a citizen or citizens of the United States as defined 46 U.S.C. 50501(a);

              (2) Owned by a foreign corporation which is not directly or beneficially owned by a citizen or citizens of the United States, but which vessel is under a long-term charter or other long-term contract covering the use of the vessel on terms deemed by the Maritime Administrator to subject the vessel to United States control in the event of an emergency. The charterer of such vessel must be either a citizen or citizens of the United States or a foreign corporation in which a majority of the stock is owned and controlled by a citizen or citizens of the United States, whether direct or indirect through intervening corporations, foreign or domestic. Where such intervening corporations are foreign, ultimate majority ownership and control of the stock of such corporations must be vested in a citizen or citizens of the United States, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 50501(a).
              (c) Any other vessel, at the sole discretion of the Maritime Administrator, but only while engaged in a service which has been determined by the Maritime Administrator to be in the interest of the national defense or the national economy of the United States. Vessels in this category are not eligible for war risk insurance interim binders.
            
            
              § 308.2
              Requirements for eligible vessels.
              (a) Restrictions—foreign-flag vessels. Interim insurance is available on any vessel described in § 308.1(a) and (b), provided application for interim insurance is submitted as required in subparts B, C, or D of this part 308, and the Maritime Administrator approves said application: Provided, that only vessels of Panamanian, Honduran, Bahamian, Republic of the Marshall Islands or Liberian registry not more than 20 years old will be considered eligible under § 308.1 (b) for interim insurance, subject at all times to the determination specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (b) Special rules—foreign-flag vessels. For the purpose of providing interim insurance on vessels described in § 308.1(b), the Maritime Administrator shall consider the characteristics, employment, and general management of the vessel. The Maritime Administrator formally determines that the following vessels are engaged in a service in the interest of the national defense or the national economy of the United States and qualify for an interim binder:
              (1) Vessels substantially engaged in the foreign commerce of the United States or which would be required in the event of war or national emergency;
              (2) Tankers of not less than 2,000 deadweight tons;
              (3) Dry cargo vessels, including containerships, break-bulk, and dry bulk vessels;
              (4) Heavy lift vessels;
              (5) Refrigerated vessels and other classes of ships in short supply in the United States-flag fleet;
              (6) Passenger vessels; and
              (7) Other vessels with special capabilities, as determined by the Maritime Administrator.
              (c) Vessel Position Reports. All vessels for which war risk insurance interim binders have been issued shall file a Vessel Position Report. The purpose of this report is to inform U.S. agencies of vessel arrivals, departures, and at-sea locations. Failure to make required regular reports will cause MARAD to issue a one-time notice of default. If failure to report continues, MARAD shall cancel the interim binder for the subject vessel and any insurance attaching thereunder. MARAD will issue reporting instructions and formats with the binders.
              (d) Notice of change in status of vessel after binder issued. Any breach of the warranty prescribed hereunder as to vessels in all categories with respect to Department of Commerce Transportation Order T-1 (44 CFR Parts 401 and 402), as well as the additional warranties as to vessels in categories (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, with respect to maintenance of eligibility for insurance and availability of the insured vessels to the U.S. Government in time of emergency, shall terminate the binders and any insurance attaching thereunder. In the event of the sale, demise charter, requisition, confiscation, change of flag, total loss, or any other change in status which, by the terms of the binder causes the binder to terminate, prompt notice shall be given in writing to MARAD's underwriting agent and to MARAD at: Division of Marine Insurance, Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., MAR-712, Washington, DC 20950.
              (e) Nature of change in status of other vessels. It is the intention of the parties that any breach of the warranty as to operation in the approved service of vessels described in § 308.1(c) shall terminate the insurance. In the event of the sale, demise charter, requisition, confiscation, change of flag, total loss, any other change in status or change in operation of the vessel in the approved service prompt notice shall be given to MARAD's underwriting agent MARAD's underwriting agent and to MARAD at the address in paragraph (d) of this section.
            
            
              § 308.3
              Applications for insurance; warranties; supporting documents; payment of binder fees.
              (a) Application, binder forms. A single application for War Risk Insurance shall be filed on Form MA-528, specifying the types of insurance coverages for which the applicant is applying. A single application may be submitted for several vessels, if the application identifies each vessel to be insured and the coverage(s) required, by completing appendices A and B to that form. An interim binder for war risk insurance coverage, of the types described in subparts B, C and D of this part, shall be on Form MA-942, which may be obtained from the MARAD's underwriting agent or from MARAD.
              (b) Warranties—(1) In general. Applications for war risk hull and protection and indemnity insurance in any eligible category of this part 308 shall include a warranty that, at all times during the effective period of the binder and any insurance attaching thereunder, the insured vessel, regardless of its nation of registry, will comply with Department of Commerce Transportation Order T-1 (44 CFR parts 401 and 402), or any modifications thereof so long as it remains in force and that the vessel will not be chartered, unless in accordance with the provisions of §§ 221.11 and 221.13 of this chapter, which requirement is applicable to any charter in existence at the time the applicant applies for insurance.
              (2) Vessels described in § 308.1(a). Applications for war risk insurance on a vessel described in § 308.1(a) shall contain the warranty that at, and from the date of issuance of the interim binder, and for and during the term of any insurance attaching thereunder, such vessel will remain eligible within its category.
              (3) Vessels described in § 308.1(b). Applications for war risk insurance on a vessel described in § 308.1(b) shall contain the warranties that at all times the vessel will remain eligible within its applicable category; that the vessel will be made available for use by the United States pursuant to the signed Contract of Commitment submitted with the insurance applications, as required by MARAD; that the vessel will remain in the approved service; and that no controlling interest in the vessel shall be transferred by a subsequent sale or long-term charter, except on the condition that the successor in interest agrees to be bound by the terms of the applicant's Contract of Commitment. All instruments transferring any controlling interest in the vessel, including long-term charter or merger agreements, shall be submitted to MARAD for prior approval.
              (4) Vessels described in § 308.1(c). Applications for war risk insurance on a vessel described in § 308.1(c) shall contain warranties that the vessel will remain in the approved service and that any change in flag or service will be reported in advance to MARAD for a new determination as to whether the vessel's service is in the interest of the national defense or the national economy of the United States. Vessels in this category are not eligible for war risk insurance interim binders.
              (5) Vessel locator filing requirements. Applications for insurance on vessels in all categories, except tugs and barges and vessels used exclusively in the fishing trade or industry, described in § 308.1(a), shall contain a warranty that at all times the vessel will file reports as required under the U.S. Coast Guard's Automated Mutual-Assistance Vessel Rescue System (AMVER) as prescribed in § 308.2(c) of this section.
              (c) Filing applications for insurance. All applications for insurance on a vessel shall be made to MARAD's underwriting agent and to MARAD at the address in § 308.2(d).

              (ii) An executed agreement contained in the application for insurance that any charter or other contract covering the use of the vessel during the period of the binder or any insurance attaching thereunder shall be subject to termination or suspension without notice in the event the United States requires the use of the vessel under the voluntary contract of commitment submitted by the applicant.
              (2) Certification of citizenship.

The charterer shall also furnish to MARAD a certified copy of any amendment to such charter which may be issued subsequent to the issuance of any binder of insurance under this part 308.
              (4) Foreign government action or approval. An application for a vessel in this category also shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the evidence of any official action or approval required by the government of the country of registry as a prerequisite to the execution of a contract of commitment with the United States.

              (iii) In the case of a new vessel or a vessel which has not for the six (6) months immediately prior to the date of the application been engaged in the foreign commerce of the United States, a statement, signed by a responsible company official, certifying the extent to which the vessel will be engaged in the foreign commerce of the United States for the six (6) months immediately following the issuance of any interim binder of insurance under this part 308.

              An applicant for war risk hull insurance shall state the amount of insurance desired but any payment of claim for damage to or actual or constructive total loss of the vessel insured shall be made as provided in § 308.103(a).

The binder fee (not refundable) for foreign-flag vessels shall be $50 per application for vessels under 500 gross tons; $200 per application for vessels 500 tons or over; and $200 per barge application.

              § 308.103
              Insured amounts under interim binder.
              (a) Valuation. The valuation in the policy for damage to, or actual or constructive total loss of the vessel insured shall be a stated valuation (exclusive of National Defense features paid for by the Government) determined by the Maritime Administrator which shall not exceed the amount that would be payable if the vessel had been requisitioned for title under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 563 at the time of the attachment of the insurance under said policy: Provided, however, that in the case of a construction subsidized vessel, for the period of insurance prior to requisition for title or use, the valuation so determined shall be reduced by such proportion as the amount of construction subsidy paid with respect to the vessel bears to the entire construction cost and capital improvements thereof (excluding the cost of national defense features), and for the period of insurance after requisition for use the valuation so determined shall not exceed the amount which would be payable under 46 U.S.C. 56303 in the case of requisition for title or use: Provided, further, that the insured shall have the right within sixty (60) days after the attachment of the insurance under said policy, or within sixty (60) days after determination of such valuation by the Maritime Administrator, whichever is later, to reject such valuation, and shall pay, at the rate provided for in said policy, premiums upon such asserted valuation as the insured shall specify at the time of rejection, but such asserted valuation shall not operate to the prejudice of the Government in any subsequent action on the policy. In the event of the actual or constructive total loss of the vessel, if the insured has not rejected such valuation the amount of any claim therefor which is adjusted, compromised, settled, adjudged, or paid shall not exceed such stated amount, but if the insured has so rejected such valuation, the insured shall be paid as a tentative advance only, 75 per centum of such valuation so determined by the Maritime Administrator and shall be entitled to sue the United States in a court having jurisdiction of such claims to recover such valuation as would be equal to the just compensation which such court determines would have been payable if the vessel had been requisitioned for title under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 563 at the time of the attachment of the insurance under said policy: Provided, however, that in the case of a construction-subsidized vessel, the valuation determined by the court as such just compensation for any period of insurance prior to actual requisition for title or use of the vessel shall be reduced by such proportion as the amount of construction subsidy paid with respect to the vessel bears to the entire construction cost and capital improvements thereof (excluding the cost of national defense features), and for any period of insurance after actual requisition for use, the valuation determined by the court shall be the amount which would have been payable under 46 U.S.C. 56303 in the case of requisition for title: And provided further, that in the event of an election by the insured to reject the stated valuation fixed by the Maritime Administrator and to sue in the courts, the amount of the judgment will be payable without regard to any limitations provided by statute, although the excess of any amounts advanced on account of just compensation that is over the amount of the court judgment shall be required to be refunded by the insured. In the event of such court determination, premiums under the policy shall be adjusted on the basis of the valuation as finally determined and of the rate provided for in said policy. The “stated valuation” of the vessel insured refers to the vessel as described in § 309.5 of this chapter.
              (b) Insurance risks. Insurance risks covered by the terms of the standard form of war risk hull insurance policy (§ 308.107), except damage to or actual or constructive total loss of the vessel insured as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and loss of disbursements (limited to consumable and subsistence stores, slop chests, bar stock and bunker fuel lost as a consequence of the actual or constructive total loss of the vessel insured) as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section and identified as disbursements, shall be insured for an amount not in excess of the “sum insured” as referred to in said policy.
              (c) Disbursements. Disbursements shall be insured as authorized under 46 U.S.C. 53903(a)(4) and shall be limited to consumable and subsistence stores, slop chests, bar stock and bunker fuel. Disbursements insurance shall be optional and is insurance additional to the war risk hull insurance provided under this subpart, and payment of claim shall be limited to the actual value of the disbursements lost as a consequence of the actual or constructive total loss of the vessel insured.
            
            
              § 308.104
              Additional war risk insurance.
              Owners or charterers may obtain, on an excess basis, additional war risk insurance in such amounts as desired and such insurance shall not inure to the benefit of the Maritime Administrator as underwriter.
            
            
              § 308.105
              Reporting casualties and filing claims.
              All casualties occurring after insurance under a binder has attached shall be reported promptly to the underwriting agent that issued the binder and all claim documents shall likewise be filed with such underwriting agent, but payment of the amounts due in settlement of claims will be made by the Maritime Administrator.

            Subpart F—War Risk Cargo Insurance
            
              Introduction
              
                § 308.500
                Authority.
                The Secretary of Transportation has delegated authority to the Maritime Administrator to perform the functions vested in the Secretary by 46 U.S.C. Chapter 539, which authority includes the insurance set forth in this Subpart, as provided under 46 U.S.C. 53903(a)(3). For the purposes of this Subpart F—War Risk Cargo Insurance, the terms “cargo” and “cargoes” as used herein shall include loaded or empty containers located aboard American and foreign-flag vessels insured under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 539. Cargo war risk insurance will be written under either an open policy or a facultative policy in accordance with the provisions of this subpart.
              
              
                § 308.501
                Cargoes on which coverage is available.
                The Maritime Administrator will be prepared to provide marine insurance against loss or damage by the risks of war under approved clauses on shipments of cargoes coming within one or more of the following categories:
                (a) Shipped or to be shipped on any American vessel, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 53901;
                (b) Shipped or to be shipped on any foreign flag vessels owned by citizens of the United States;

                (c) Owned by citizens or residents of the United States, its Territories or possessions;
                
                (d) Imported to, or exported from, the United States, its Territories or possessions, under contracts of sale or purchase by the terms of which the risk of loss by war risks or the obligation to provide insurance against such risks is assumed by or falls upon a citizen or resident of the United States, its Territories or possessions;
                (e) Sold or purchased by citizens or residents of the United States, its Territories or possessions, under contracts of sale or purchase by the terms of which the risk of loss by war risks or the obligation to provide insurance against such risks is assumed by or falls upon a citizen or resident of the United States, its Territories or possessions;
                (f) Shipped between ports in the United States, or between ports in the United States and its Territories and possessions, or between ports in such Territories or possessions; and
                (g) Shipped or to be shipped on any foreign flag vessels, whether or not owned by citizens of the United States, if such vessels are engaged in transportation in the water-borne commerce of the United States or in such other transportation by water or such other services as may be deemed by the Maritime Administrator to be in the interest of the national defense or the national economy of the United States, when so engaged.
              
              
                § 308.502
                Additional insurance.
                The assured may place increased value or additional insurance in other markets beyond the amount of insurance provided by the Maritime Administrator, but such insurance must be non-participating with the Maritime Administrator's coverage, and without benefit of salvage or right of contribution.
              
              
                § 308.503
                Rate schedules.
                Rate schedules published by the Maritime Administrator may be obtained from an underwriting agent. All rate schedules are subject to change by the Maritime Administrator at any time without notice. If no rate is published for a voyage on which war risk coverage is available, the Maritime Administrator will name a rate through an underwriting agent upon application.
              
              
                § 308.504
                Definition of territories and possessions.
                Whenever reference is made to the territories and possessions of the United States in this subpart or in any supplement thereto or any policy of insurance issued pursuant to the provisions thereof, said territories and possessions shall be deemed to include only the Virgin Islands of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Wake Island, Midway Islands, Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Navassa Island, and Wake Island.
              
            
            
              Open Policy War Risk Cargo Insurance
              
                § 308.505
                General.
                The Maritime Administrator is prepared to provide an open cargo war risk insurance policy covering any cargoes described in § 308.501. The policy will be in the standard form of War Risk Open Cargo Policy, Form MA-300, prescribed in § 308.517. All policies will be issued by underwriting agents appointed by the Maritime Administrator. All underwriting agents will be domestic insurance companies authorized to do a marine insurance business in a State of the United States.
              
              
                § 308.506
                Application for an Open Cargo Policy.

                Application for an Open Cargo Policy shall be made by filing Form MA-301, prescribed in § 308.521, with the underwriting agent of MARAD. The application shall state the applicant's name and address; the person or persons to whom loss shall be payable; the nature and geographic scope of the shipments to be covered under the policy which shall not be broader than the coverage authorized in § 308.501; the requested effective date, which shall not be earlier than the date of the completion of the requirements for the issuance of the policy; and the basis of valuation to be incorporated in the policy. An applicant may specify one basis of valuation for imports and another for exports, and he may specify different bases of valuation for different commodities or voyages, provided that each basis of valuation specified by the applicant shall define the value by the use of facts which existed prior to the date of the shipment and which are readily ascertainable by either party after the safe arrival or loss of the shipment.
              
              
                § 308.507
                Security for payment of premiums.
                Clause 21 of the policy requires the assured to maintain with the Maritime Administrator a collateral deposit fund or a surety bond, to secure the payment of the premiums, in an amount which shall at all times exceed the unpaid premiums on all risks which have attached under the policy. The minimum amount of the fund or of the surety bond shall be $1,000. Clause 21 also provides that, within seven (7) days from the time knowledge comes to the assured that the amount of the deposit or the surety bond is insufficient to meet the requirements of Clause 21, the assured shall deposit additional collateral or increase the surety bond in an amount not less than double the amount of such insufficiency, and for a sum which shall be a multiple of $500. If the assured fails to increase the deposit or the surety bond within the seven (7) day period, the policy automatically becomes void at the end of the seven (7) day period except as to risks which have attached prior to that date. The procedure for establishing a collateral deposit fund is prescribed in § 308.509, and the procedure for posting and maintaining a surety bond is prescribed in § 308.510. An application for the issuance of an open cargo policy shall be ineffective unless a collateral deposit fund is established and maintained, or a surety bond is posted and maintained, in accordance with the provisions of this section and § 308.510.
              
              
                § 308.508
                Issuance of an Open Cargo Policy.
                (a) Time. The underwriting agent will issue an Open Cargo Policy within fifteen (15) days after the completion by the applicant of the requirements set forth in §§ 308.506 and 308.507 unless the time for issuance is extended by the Maritime Administrator in writing. The underwriting agent may not make any Open Cargo Policy effective with respect to shipments attaching on a date earlier than the date when the application was completed, but he may make it effective on the date of the completion of the application or any date thereafter requested by the applicant.
                (b) Numbering. Each Open Cargo Policy supplied to the underwriting agent by the Maritime Administrator shall be numbered by MARAD before it is supplied to the underwriting agent. No two numbers shall be the same. The underwriting agent when issuing the policy shall add at the end of the policy number the agency number assigned to that underwriting agent, and where policies are issued by more than one office of an underwriting agent, the issuing office shall also be identified in the policy number. For example, policies issued by an office in New York will be designated by “NY” and policies issued in San Francisco will be designated by “SF” prefixed to the underwriting agent's agency number.
              
              
                § 308.509
                Collateral deposit fund.
                (a) Requirements. An assured electing to use a cash collateral deposit fund pursuant to § 308.507 shall comply with the provisions of this section and Clause 21 of the Open Cargo Policy, Form MA-300, prescribed in § 308.517.
                (b) Cash or Government bonds. To establish a collateral deposit fund the applicant shall deposit with the underwriting agent a check payable to the order of the “Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation” for the amount of the fund, or United States Government bonds having a par value at the time of deposit of the amount of the fund, which shall be a multiple of $500 but not less than $1,000, together with a letter of transmittal executed by the applicant on Form MA-302, prescribed in § 308.522. Upon receipt of the deposit, the underwriting agent shall assign it a serial number and transmit it to “Maritime Administration, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, Maritime Administration”. It is the responsibility of the assured to make sure that this deposit fund is sufficient at all times to cover the premiums payable on all risks which have attached under the policy, so as to prevent the termination of the insurance under the provisions of Clause 21.
                (c) Overdue premiums. Pursuant to Clause 20, if the assured fails to pay any premium when it becomes due and payable, he thereby breaches the policy and it automatically ceases to insure any shipments which would otherwise have attached after the expiration of fifteen (15) days following the due date of the premium, unless within the fifteen (15) day period the premium has been paid and the assured has otherwise complied with the requirements of the policy, including the filing of the closing report required by Clause 19 and the payment of the reinstatement fee of $25 required by Clause 20. If the assured fails to pay the premium within the fifteen (15) day period, the Maritime Administrator may deduct from the assured's collateral deposit fund all amounts due.
                (d) Increase in amount of collateral as required by Clause 21. If the assured fails to deposit additional collateral in the fund within seven (7) days from the time knowledge comes to the assured that the amount of collateral is insufficient to meet the requirements of Clause 21, the policy shall be void except as to risks which have attached prior to the expiration of the seven (7) day period.
                (e) Changes in amount of collateral. The assured may increase or decrease the amount of the collateral deposit fund by amounts of not less than $500 or multiples thereof, provided that the amount of the fund shall not be less than the amount required by Clause 21, or the required minimum of $1,000, whichever is greater. The effect of any change in the amount of the collateral deposit shall be the sole responsibility of the assured, and the permission granted by this paragraph to change the amount of collateral in the fund shall in no manner relieve the assured of the responsibility imposed by Clause 21.
                (f) Increase of collateral. To increase the amount of the collateral on deposit in the fund, the assured shall transmit to the underwriting agent on Form MA-302, prescribed in § 308.522, a check payable to the order of “Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation” or United States Government bonds having a par value at the time of deposit of not less than the amount of the requested increase. The increase shall become effective upon the date of the receipt of the application and check or bonds by the underwriting agent, as shown on Form MA-302.
                (g) Decrease of collateral. To decrease the collateral deposit fund, the assured shall file with the underwriting agent an application on Form MA-305, prescribed in § 308.525. The decrease shall become effective upon the date of the receipt of the application by the underwriting agent as shown on Form MA-305.
                (h) Refund of collateral. Whenever the assured becomes entitled to a refund of the collateral deposit, in whole or in part, by reason of a request for a partial return of such collateral, or the cancellation of the policy and the payment in full of all premiums then or thereafter due, or the waiver by the Maritime Administrator of the requirements of maintaining the collateral deposit fund because the assured is a department or agency of the United States or is acting on behalf of such a department or agency, or the substitution of a surety bond in the place and stead of the collateral deposit fund, as provided in § 308.510(j), the Maritime Administrator will refund to the assured the amount of the collateral deposit to which the assured is entitled; provided, however, that the repayment of such collateral shall not be made by the Maritime Administrator until the assured has filed a closing report and paid in full all premiums with respect to all shipments which had attached at the time of the receipt by the underwriting agent of the application for the refund, Form MA-305, and a certificate executed in duplicate on Form MA-306, prescribed in § 308.526, and, in the event of the substitution of a surety bond for the collateral deposit fund, the receipt by the underwriting agent of the surety bond properly executed, in accordance with § 308.510.
              
              
                § 308.510
                Surety bond.
                (a) Requirements. An assured electing to post a surety bond pursuant to § 308.507 shall comply with the provisions of this section and Clause 21 of the Open Cargo Policy, Form MA-300, prescribed in § 308.517.
                (b) Amount of bond. An applicant who wishes to post a surety bond shall deliver to the underwriting agent a surety bond on Form MA-308, prescribed in § 308.528, executed by the assured as principal, and by the surety, in such amount as the assured determines to be necessary to comply with Clause 21. Such amount shall be a multiple of $500 but shall not be less than $1,000. Upon receipt of the surety bond, the underwriting agent shall assign a serial number to it and transmit it to “Maritime Administration, Attention: Chief, Division of Marine Insurance.” It shall be the responsibility of the assured to provide that the amount of the bond is sufficient at all times to cover the premium payable on all risks which have attached under the policy, so as to prevent the termination of the insurance under the provisions of Clause 21.
                (c) Surety. The sufficiency of the surety executing the bond shall be subject to approval by the Maritime Administrator. The underwriting agent may accept on behalf of the Maritime Administrator a surety bond executed by a surety named on the United States Treasury Department's approved list of sureties whose bonds are acceptable to the United States Treasury Department to secure obligations due the United States, provided the bond is within the maximum amount for which the surety is so authorized to write bonds as shown by the approved list.
                (d) Overdue premiums. Pursuant to Clause 20, if the assured fails to pay any premium when it becomes due and payable, he thereby breaches the policy and it automatically ceases to insure any shipments which would otherwise have attached after the expiration of fifteen (15) days following the due date of the premium, unless within the fifteen (15) day period the premium has been paid and the assured has otherwise complied with the requirements of the policy, including the filing of the closing report required by Clause 19 and the payment of the reinstatement fee of $25 required by Clause 20. If the assured fails to pay the premium within the fifteen (15) day period, all amounts due shall become a liability collectible under the surety bond and from the assured.
                (e) Increase in amount of bond as required by Clause 21. If the assured fails to increase the amount of the surety bond within seven (7) days from the time knowledge comes to the assured that the amount of the bond is insufficient to meet the requirements of Clause 21, the policy shall be void except as to risks which have attached prior to the expiration of the seven (7) day period.
                (f) Changes in amount of bond. The assured may increase or decrease the amount of the surety bond by amounts of not less than $500 or multiples thereof, provided that the amount of the bond shall not be less than the amount required by Clause 21, or the required minimum of $1,000, whichever is greater. The effect of any change in the amount of the bond shall be the sole responsibility of the assured, and the permission granted by this paragraph to change the amount of the bond shall in no manner relieve the assured of the responsibility imposed by Clause 21.
                (g) Increase in amount of bond. To increase the surety bond the assured shall transmit to the underwriting agent, on Form MA-310, prescribed in § 308.530, an endorsement duly executed by the assured and the surety company on Form MA-311, prescribed in § 308.531. The increase shall become effective upon the date of the receipt of the endorsement by the underwriting agent as shown on Form MA-311.
                (h) Decrease in amount of bond. To decrease the amount of the bond, the assured shall transmit to the underwriting agent, on Form MA-310, prescribed in § 308.530, an endorsement duly executed by the assured and the surety on Form MA-311, prescribed in § 308.531. The decrease shall become effective upon the date of the receipt of the endorsement by the underwriting agent as shown on Form MA-311, except as to shipments which on that date are known or reported to the assured to be in transit and which have attached under the policy and upon which premium has not been paid in full.
                (i) Termination of bond. Whenever the assured becomes entitled to a termination of a surety bond by reason of the cancellation of the policy and the payment in full of all premiums then or thereafter due, or the waiver by the Maritime Administrator of the requirements of maintaining the surety bond by an assured which is a department or agency of the United States or is acting on behalf of such a department or agency, or the substitution of a collateral deposit fund in the place or stead of the surety bond, the underwriting agent shall execute a release on Form MA-312, prescribed in § 308.532. The release shall be made effective as of:
                (1) The effective date of the cancellation of the policy when the bond is terminated for that reason, or
                (2) The date of the Maritime Administrator's directive waiving the requirement of a surety bond when the bond is terminated for that reason, or
                (3) The effective date of the establishment of a collateral deposit fund when the bond is terminated for that reason.
                (j) Substitution of bond for collateral deposit. An assured may substitute a surety bond for a collateral deposit fund by delivering to the underwriting agent a surety bond on Form MA-309, prescribed in § 308.529, executed by the assured as principal, and by the surety, in such amount as the assured determines to be necessary to comply with Clause 21. Such amount shall be a multiple of $500, but shall not be less than $1,000. The collateral deposit fund will be refunded to the assured after the bond has been posted, in accordance with the provisions of § 308.509(h).
              
              
                § 308.511
                Cancellation of Open Cargo Policy.
                An assured may cancel an Open Cargo Policy by delivering to the underwriting agent, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the requested date of cancellation, an application for cancellation executed by the assured on Form MA-304, prescribed in § 308.524, together with the original policy. The policy shall be cancelled as of the effective date requested in the application, which, unless otherwise agreed by the Maritime Administrator in writing, shall not be a date earlier than fifteen (15) days following the date of the receipt of the application as acknowledged by the underwriting agent on Form MA-304, with respect to all risks that have not attached prior to said effective date. Such cancellation shall not relieve the assured of the obligation to file closing reports with respect to all risks which attached prior to the effective date of the cancellation and to pay all unpaid premiums. Within four (4) months of the effective date of cancellation, unless otherwise agreed by the Maritime Administrator in writing, the assured must file a closing report in duplicate on Form MA-313, prescribed in § 308.533, of all shipments covered by the policy for which closing reports have not been previously filed. The assured shall mark this closing report ”Final Closing Report on Cancellation of Policy”, and file a certificate on Form MA-313-B, prescribed in § 308.535, executed by the assured in duplicate. Thereafter, when all unpaid premiums have been paid, the assured will become entitled to a refund of the collateral deposit, or cancellation of the surety bond in accordance with §§ 308.509 and 308.510. If the assured has lost or mislaid the original policy and is unable to produce it for cancellation, the assured shall execute a letter of indemnity and such other documents as may be required by the Maritime Administrator.
              
              
                § 308.512
                Declaration of shipments under Open Cargo Policy.
                (a) Closing report. (1) The assured shall file with the underwriting agent, not later than the twenty-fifth (25th) day of each month, a closing report for all inward shipments and a closing report for all outward shipments, and pay the premium and fees, for all shipments covered during the preceding calendar month, as required by Clause 19. Each closing report shall be filed in duplicate on Form MA-313, prescribed in § 308.533, supported by a certificate executed by the assured on Form MA-313-A, prescribed in § 308.534. If the assured has no shipments to report during any calendar month, the closing report, Form MA-313, shall, nevertheless, be filed with one or both of the following statements, depending upon their applicability, noted thereon certifying that:

                (i) No inward shipment coming within the scope of this policy arrived at destination during the preceding calendar month, and that during the preceding calendar month no knowledge has come to the assured of an inward shipment covered under the terms of the policy which will not arrive by reason of loss, frustration or other similar cause,
                (ii) No outward shipment coming within the scope of this policy was made during the preceding calendar month, and
                (iii) Whenever a sea passage is made with respect to cargo covered under the policy by a barge or sailing vessel the assured shall note that fact upon the closing report, unless the Maritime Administrator otherwise agrees.
                (2) An assured reporting for one calendar month shall not include therein a report of a shipment due to be reported in the report for the next succeeding calendar month. Thus, the report of January closing shipments filed in February does not include February closings.
                (b) Inward shipments. The closing report covering inward shipments shall include:
                (1) All such shipments which have arrived at the port of destination during the preceding calendar month, and
                (2) All such shipments with respect to which inability to so arrive by reason of loss, frustration, or other similar causes has come to the knowledge of the assured during the preceding calendar month.
                (c) Outward shipments. The closing report covering outward shipments shall include all such shipments which attached under the policy during the preceding calendar month.
                (d) Definition of inward and outward shipments. A shipment will be classified as an inward shipment or as an outward shipment by reference to the geographical location of the assured with respect to the movement of the shipment. The address of the assured as stated in the application filed by him for the policy shall be deemed to be the assured's geographical location for the purpose of determining whether the shipment is inward or outward. To illustrate, if an assured has stated in his application that his address is in Hawaii, the assured's shipments of goods from the United States to Hawaii would be classified as inward, and his shipments from Hawaii to the United States would be classified as outward. Any shipments that cannot be classified as inward or outward under this definition shall be treated as inward shipments for the purposes of the declaration.
                (e) Supplemental closing report. If an assured files a closing report and thereafter discovers that one or more additional shipments should have been included in the report, then, even though the assured has executed the certificate on Form MA-313-A, prescribed in § 308.534, or Form MA-313-B, prescribed in § 308.535, in connection with the closing report, the assured must nevertheless amend the closing report by filing a supplemental closing report supported by an appropriate certificate. The supplemental closing report must be accompanied by a statement in writing signed by the assured giving the reasons for the omission of such shipments from the original closing report. If the Maritime Administrator finds that the failure to file the complete closing report was either inadvertent or unintentional or arose by reason of causes beyond the control of the assured, the otherwise automatic termination of the policy by reason of a breach of the warranty embodied in Clause 20 shall be avoided pursuant to the provisions of Clause 23.
              
              
                § 308.513
                Payment of premiums and fees.
                The assured shall pay the premium, when his closing report is filed, for all shipments shown on his closing report for the preceding month, at the rates prescribed by the Maritime Administrator and in effect on the date of the ocean bill of lading, or if an ocean bill of lading was not issued, on the date of the equivalent shipping document, or if no ocean bill of lading or equivalent shipping document was issued, or if such documents were undated, on the date the goods were laden on the overseas vessel, as required by Clause 19. All payments of premium or fees must be made by check or money order payable to the order of ”Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation.”
              
              
                
                § 308.514
                Return premium.
                No premium will be returned to the assured with respect to a shipment of goods that attached under the policy except where there was a declaration of value at variance with Clause 8, or an error in the application of a rate or in the computation of a premium, or the insured goods were short-shipped. An application for the return of a premium shall be made on Form MA-307, prescribed in § 308.527, filed in duplicate with the Underwriting Agent who will transmit it to the Maritime Administrator for payment.
              
              
                § 308.515
                Payment in event of loss.
                All claims for losses shall be filed by the assured with the Underwriting Agent who issued the policy. Such claims must be supported by the customary documents required in connection with war risk insurance claims, together with appropriate declarations as required by Clause 9, and such further data as may now or hereafter be required by the Maritime Administrator.
              
              
                § 308.516
                Failure to comply with Clause 21.
                (a) If the assured willfully fails to maintain a collateral deposit fund or a surety bond in an amount sufficient to meet the requirements of Clause 21, the policy becomes void from the date the fund or bond was first insufficient, but, if the assured's failure was inadvertent, the policy may be reinstated when the assured complies with Clause 21, and shows to the satisfaction of the Maritime Administrator that his failure was inadvertent and not willful. If the failure was in fact inadvertent, the assured shall file a declaration on Form MA-314, prescribed in § 308.536, executed in duplicate, with the Underwriting Agent within seven (7) days from the time knowledge comes to the assured of the insufficiency of the collateral deposit fund or surety bond unless the time for filing such declaration is extended by permission of the Maritime Administrator. If the space provided in the declaration, Form MA-314, for an explanation of the circumstances whereby the assured first had knowledge that the collateral was not sufficient, the assured shall attach to the declaration a detailed statement and include the same by reference in the declaration.
                (b) If any policy becomes void by reason of the failure of the assured to deposit additional collateral or increase the amount of its surety bond under the provisions of Clause 21, the Maritime Administrator reserves the right to refuse to issue another policy to such assured for a period of ninety (90) days.
              
              
                § 308.517

                Standard Optional Endorsement No. 1, which may be obtained from MARAD's underwriting agent or MARAD, limits the amount payable for the loss of goods to the actual bona fide pecuniary loss to the Assured, exclusive of any allowance for anticipated or accrued profit arising out of the insured venture. An Assured may elect to have his Open Cargo Policy endorsed with Standard Optional Endorsement No. 1 applicable on all shipments, or on all outward shipments, or on all inward shipments, or on named commodities except goods sold by the Assured prior to loading on board the overseas vessel and shipped for the account and at the risk of third persons other than a branch subsidiary or affiliate of the Assured. When an Assured has elected to have Standard Optional Endorsement No. 1 made applicable to certain named commodities he may not change to a different basis of valuation for those commodities until after he has given ninety (90) days written notice to the Maritime Administrator through the Underwriting Agent of his election to make the change. Application for Standard Optional Endorsement No. 1 may be made to the Underwriting Agent which is authorized to issue the endorsement without prior approval of the Maritime Administrator.

Application for Standard Optional Endorsement No. 3 may be made to the Underwriting Agent, which shall transmit it to the Maritime Administrator for approval or disapproval of the issuance of the endorsement.

              Facultative War Risk Cargo Insurance
              
                § 308.538
                General.
                The Maritime Administrator is prepared to provide facultative war risk insurance policies covering any cargoes described in § 308.501 which are designated by an applicant prior to the attachment of risks, if the applicant does not have an Open Cargo Policy issued by the Maritime Administrator, or if he has a shipment which is not covered by his Open Cargo Policy. However, a person with regular shipments is urged to avail himself of the advantages of the automatic coverage of an Open Cargo Policy. The Maritime Administrator reserves the right to decline to quote rates or bind insurance on shipments of cargo that could be covered by an Open Cargo Policy unless the applicant can show to the satisfaction of the Maritime Administrator that the risk is not one of a series of similar risks forming part of a continual flow of business for the applicant. The policy will be in the standard form of War Risk Facultative Cargo Policy, Form MA-316, prescribed in § 308.545. All policies shall be issued by Underwriting Agents appointed by the Maritime Administrator. All Underwriting Agents shall be domestic insurance companies authorized to do a marine insurance business in a State of the United States.
              
              
                § 308.539
                Application.
                (a) Preliminary request. Application for a Facultative Cargo Policy shall be made by filing a preliminary request in writing (including telegram) with an Underwriting Agent of MARAD, setting forth the following information:
                (1) The name and address of the applicant;
                (2) The amount of insurance requested;
                (3) The commodity and quantity to be insured;
                (4) The voyage to be covered;

                (5) The name of the vessel upon which the cargo will be shipped, if known, the name of the steamship line, if known, and the date of shipment, if the applicant is submitting the request to bind war risk in writing; for security reasons, if the applicant is submitting the order to bind war risk insurance by telefax, neither the name of the vessel nor the name of the steamship line nor the anticipated date of sailing, should be mentioned. Mentioning such information in a telefax may result in a denial of insurance to the applicant. Any envelope transmitting a letter containing such information shall be marked “confidential.”
                (b) Binder. Before the insurance can be bound, the applicant shall provide the Underwriting Agent with a properly prepared binder on Form MA-315 prescribed in § 308.544. The binder must be submitted in duplicate, accompanied by check or Money Order payable to the order of ”Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation” for the full amount of the premium computed on the amount to be insured at the rate set by the Maritime Administrator. Any application for facultative cargo war risk insurance received by an Underwriting Agent later than 4 p.m. (Local Time) shall be considered the next day's business.
                (c) Optional loss limits clause. Clause 9 of the standard form of facultative cargo policy, Form MA-316, prescribed in § 308.545, limits the amount payable for loss to the fair market value at the place and approximate time of the attachment of risk, plus the cost of marine insurance, transportation and expenses incident thereto, and war risk insurance with respect to the lost or damaged goods, or if it is impossible to determine the fair market value at place and time of attachment of risk, the fair market value at the designated port of arrival on the date of the attachment of the risk, plus the cost of marine insurance, transportation and expenses incidental thereto, and war risk insurance with respect to the lost or damaged goods, or if the goods had been purchased prior to loading, the actual amount paid or payable to the seller for the goods less all discounts, plus the cost of marine insurance, transportation and expenses incidental thereto, and war risk insurance with respect to the lost or damaged goods. In lieu of these loss limits, the Assured by so specifying in his application, and the binder may have attached to the policy when issued Standard Optional Endorsement No. 1-A, Form MA-316, prescribed in § 308.546, which limits the amount payable for loss to the actual bona fide pecuniary loss to the Assured, exclusive of any allowance for anticipated or accrued profits arising out of the insured venture.
              
              
                § 308.540
                Premiums.
                (a) Rates. Rate Schedules for war risk facultative cargo insurance will be published by the Maritime Administrator from time to time, and may be obtained from an Underwriting Agent. All Rate Schedules are subject to change by the Maritime Administrator without notice. If no rate is published for a voyage on which war risk facultative cargo insurance is available, the Maritime Administrator will name a rate through an Underwriting Agent upon application. Whenever an applicant for war risk facultative cargo insurance receives a definite rate quotation and desires to bind insurance at the quoted rate, an order to bind the insurance in accordance with the procedure set forth in this subpart should be submitted within two business days following the day of quotation accompanied by check or Money Order payable to the order of “Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation” for the full amount of the premium thereon computed on the amount to be insured at the rate set by the Maritime Administrator, or the quotation will expire.
                (b) Return premium. Where goods are short-shipped, the amount of insurance may be reduced by an amount computed by applying to the original amount of insurance the proportion which the quantity of merchandise short-shipped (i.e., bales, barrels, tons, and other designations of quantity) bears to the total quantity of merchandise originally declared for insurance. Where more than one class of merchandise is insured under one policy (e.g., fuel, oil and gasoline) the reduced amount of insurance must be computed separately on each item. Where the amount of insurance is reduced, the Maritime Administrator will give consideration to requests for proportionate returns of premium. An application for the return of a premium must be submitted to the Underwriting Agent in quadruplicate on Form MA-317, prescribed in § 308.547.
              
              
                § 308.541
                Issuance.
                (a) Binder. The Underwriting Agent is authorized to issue a facultative policy in Form MA-316, prescribed in § 308.545, when there has been presented to him a properly prepared binder on Form MA-315, prescribed in § 308.544, together with the payment of the premium as required, and such policy shall be issued as soon as possible after the binder form has been presented to the Underwriting Agent. Prior to the issuance of the policy, the Underwriting Agent is authorized to accept the risk on behalf of the Maritime Administrator by signing the binder. The Maritime Administrator will provide each Underwriting Agent with a supply of facultative policies which shall not be valid until countersigned by the Underwriting Agent. The Underwriting Agent shall keep a permanent record of all such policies and the Assured to whom the policy is issued.
                (b) Numbering. Each Facultative Cargo Policy supplied to the Underwriting Agent by the Maritime Administrator shall be numbered by MARAD before it is supplied to the Underwriting Agent. No two numbers shall be the same. The Underwriting Agent when issuing the policy shall add at the end of the Policy number the agency number assigned to that Underwriting Agent, and where policies are issued by more than one office of an Underwriting Agent the issuing office shall also be identified in the policy number. For example, the policies issued by an office in New York will be designated “NY” and policies issued in San Francisco will be designated by “SF” prefixed to the Underwriting Agent's agency number.
              
              
                § 308.542
                Warranty regarding thirty-day shipments.
                If, after an effective binding of war risk insurance on a shipment of cargo, the assured believes that it will be impossible to comply with the warranty requiring the goods to be shipped and in transit within thirty days from the effective date of binding, such an assured may apply to the Maritime Administrator, through the Underwriting Agent, to modify the warranty. If the Maritime Administrator is satisfied that an extension of time within which the goods are warranted to be shipped and in transit should be granted, he will do so, but additional premium may be charged in the discretion of the Maritime Administrator.
              
              
                § 308.543
                Cancellation.
                Facultative war risk insurance is not subject to cancellation by the Assured unless the goods are not shipped within thirty (30) days following the effective date of binding, and then only if the policy is returned for cancellation.
              
              
                § 308.544

(Similar provisions for Open Cargo Policies are contained in Standard Optional Endorsement No. 1, Form MA-300-A, prescribed in § 308.518.) Application for Standard Optional Endorsement No. 1-A shall be made to the Underwriting Agent at the time application is made for the policy. The Underwriting Agent is authorized to issue the endorsement without prior approval of the Maritime Administrator. This form may be obtained from MARAD's underwriting agent or MARAD.

            § 309.1
            Procedure.

            The Ship Valuation Committee, Maritime Administration, shall publish bianually in the notice section of the Federal Register a general notice which shall set forth the stated valuations of individual vessels upon which interim binders for war risk hull insurance have been issued. Such values shall be effective with respect to a six-month period commencing on January 1 and ending on June 30, or a six-month period commencing on July 1 and ending on December 31 of each calendar year; Provided, however, That if there is a substantial change in market values during the effective period of a state valuation, the Maritime Administration reserves the right to revise such valuations at any time during such period.
          
          
            § 309.2
            Definitions.
            (a) Ship Valuation Committee means the Ship Valuation Committee referred to in Maritime Administrative Order 440-3.
            (b) The date a vessel is built is the date the vessel is delivered by the shipbuilder.
            (c) The deadweight tonnage of a vessel means her deadweight capacity established in accordance with normal Summer Freeboard as assigned pursuant to the International Load Line Convention, 1966, and shall be her capacity (in tons of 2,240 pounds) for cargo, fuel, fresh water, spare parts, and stores, but exclusive of permanent ballast.
            (d) The speed of a vessel means the speed determined in accordance with the formulae provided in part 246 of this chapter.
            (e) A passenger vessel is a vessel which carries more than twelve passengers.
          
          
            § 309.3
            Stated valuation.
            A stated valuation represents just compensation for the vessel to which it applies computed by the Ship Valuation Committee in accordance with sections 902(a) and 1209(a)(2) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. 1242(a), 1289(a)(2)). The stated valuation of a vessel does not include vessel stores and supplies, which consist of (a) consumable stores, (b) subsistence stores, (c) slop chest, (d) bar stock, and (e) fuel, as defined in Maritime Administration Inventory Book Forms MA-4736, A through K, which will be valued separately.
          
          
            § 309.4
            Maximum amount insured.
            A stated valuation is the maximum amount for which the Maritime Administration will provide war risk hull insurance for damage to or actual or constructive total loss of the vessel to which such valuation applies and for which claims for damage to or actual or constructive total loss of such insured vessel may be adjusted, compromised, settled, adjudged, or paid by the Maritime Administration with respect to insurance attaching during the effective period of such valuation under the standard forms of war risk hull insurance interim binder or policy prescribed by §§ 308.106 and 308.107 of this chapter.
          
          
            § 309.5
            Condition of vessel.

            If the true condition of a vessel is not known, the Ship Valuation Committee, in determining the stated valuation of the vessel, may assume that it is in a condition that would entitle it to the highest classification of the American Bureau of Shipping, or the equivalent if the vessel is a foreign-flag vessel, with all required certificates, including but not limited to, marine inspection certificates of the United States Coast Guard, the United States Public Health Service, and the Federal Communications Commission, with all outstanding requirements and recommendations necessary for retention of class accomplished, without regard to any grace period; and, so far as due diligence can make her so, the vessel is tight, staunch, strong, and well and sufficiently tacked, appareled, furnished, and equipped, and in every respect seaworthy and in good running condition and repair, with clean swept holds and in all respects fit for service. The stated valuation of a vessel in substandard condition is subject to downward adjustment as provided in § 309.6(a).
          
          
            § 309.6
            Adjustments for condition, equipment, and other considerations.
            (a) Adjustment for a vessel in substandard condition. If the Maritime Administration determines that a vessel is in substandard condition from that assumed by the Committee as provided in § 309.5, there shall be subtracted from the stated valuation of such vessel an amount estimated by the Maritime Administration as the cost of putting the vessel in the condition assumed by the Committee when determining its stated valuation.
            (b) Special equipment. If the depreciated reproduction cost less construction subsidy, if any, of any special equipment of material utility in the handling of cargo or utilization of a vessel, not otherwise taken into account in determining the stated valuation of such vessel, is in excess of $50,000, an amount estimated by the Maritime Administration as the fair and reasonable value of such equipment shall be added to the stated valuation of such vessel.
            (c) Government installations. A stated valuation determined pursuant to this part shall not include any allowance for any special installations or equipment to the extent that their cost was borne by the United States.
          
          
            § 309.7
            Modifications.
            The Maritime Administration reserves the right to exempt any vessel from the scope of this part, or to amend, modify, or terminate the provisions hereof.
          
          
            § 309.8
            Vessel data forms.
            (a) To accompany application for insurance. Each application for war risk insurance, submitted in accordance with § 308.3 of this chapter, shall be accompanied by a completed Form MA-828, Vessel Data. Copies of this form may be obtained from either the American War Risk Agency, 14 Wall Street, New York, N.Y. 10005, or the Director, Office of Marine Insurance (MAR-540) Maritime Administration 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.
            (b) Modification to vessels. Revised vessel data shall be submitted on the appropriate form prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section whenever a vessel undergoes a physical change which increases or decreases its value by five percent or more.

            The interim binder for a vessel whose stated valuation is established pursuant to this part shall be deemed to have been amended on the first day of the effective period of such valuation, as provided in the notice publishing such valuation, by inserting in the space provided therefor, or in substitution for any value appearing in such space, the stated valuation of the vessel set forth in such notice. A stated valuation shall apply with respect to insurance attaching during the effective period of such valuation; Provided, however, That if there is a substantial change in market values during such period, the Maritime Administration reserves the right to revise the valuations provided for therein at any time during said period; And provided further, That the assured shall have the right within 60 days after the date of publication of a stated valuation or within 60 days after the attachment of the insurance under the interim binder to which such valuation applies, whichever is later, to reject such valuation and proceed as authorized by section 1209(a)(2), Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. 1289(a)(2)).

              It is the purpose of §§ 309.201 through 309.204 to prescribe the method for determining the values of stores and supplies on board a vessel when lost, for which claims for loss will be paid, and to prescribe the procedure for payment of claims for such loss, when stores and supplies are covered under a disbursements clause of a War Risk Hull Insurance Binder or a War Risk Hull Insurance Policy issued by the United States on forms prescribed by §§ 308.106 and 308.107 of this chapter, or when stores and supplies are covered by a War Risk Disbursements Policy issued by the United States pursuant to section 1203(c) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. 1283(c)). The vessel values established by §§ 309.1 through 309.8 (General Order 82) do not include any allowance for the loss of stores and supplies, as distinguished from equipment and spare parts which are included in such vessel values.

              Stores and supplies are those articles and commodities used and consumed in the day-to-day operation of a vessel by the operation and maintenance of machinery and equipment; the maintenance of clean and sanitary conditions; the feeding of passengers, officers, and crew; and stocked for the use and convenience of passengers, officers, and crew. Vessel stores and supplies include (a) consumable stores, (b) subsistence stores, (c) slop chest, (d) bar stock, and (e) fuel, as defined in Maritime Administration Inventory Books, Forms MA-4736, A through K.
            
            
              § 309.203
              Value at time of loss.
              The value of unused stores and supplies on board a vessel at the time of loss, and for which claims for loss will be paid equals:
              (a) The value of such stores and supplies on board at the completion of the previous voyage, plus
              (b) The value of stores and supplies purchased and placed on board the vessel before the commencement of the voyage during which the loss occurred, plus
              (c) The value of stores and supplies purchased and placed on board the vessel after the commencement of such voyage, less
              (d) That portion of the sum of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section which was sold, transferred, used or consumed to, but not including, the date of the loss.
            
            
              § 309.204
              Proof of loss.
              Claims for reimbursement for total loss of stores and supplies may be submitted by the owner to the Chief, Division of Insurance, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590, based on one of two alternative methods of proof, as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Owners may use either method for each category of stores and supplies.
              (a) Formula. In cases where the owner and the Chief, Division of Insurance, Maritime Administration, have agreed, in advance of the loss, upon amounts representing, or the method for determining, the average daily consumption costs of stores and supplies for the owner's vessel, claims for total loss of such stores and supplies may be submitted by the owner on Affidavit in Proof of Claim for the loss of stores and supplies, Exhibit A. In such cases, the value of the consumable stores at time of loss is determined as follows:
              (1) The value of consumable stores on board at the time the vessel was ready to sail, determined by multiplying the number of days for which the vessel is stored by the average daily consumption cost in dollars, plus
              (2) The cost of consumable stores, if any, purchased in foreign ports for the homeward voyage, less
              (3) The average daily consumption cost times the number of days from the date the vessel was ready to sail to, but not including, the date of loss, plus the actual amount of consumable stores transferred or sold. The values of slop chest stores, bar stock and fuel, at the time of loss are determined in the same manner by using the applicable daily consumption costs for such stores. The value of subsistence stores at the time of loss is determined as follows:

              (i) The value of subsistence stores on board at the time the vessel was ready to sail, determined by multiplying the agreed cost for one man per day by the number of crew signed on and the number of passengers, if any, and multiplying that product by the number of days for which the vessel is stored, plus
              (ii) The cost of subsistence stores, if any, purchased in foreign ports for the homeward voyage, less
              (iii) The number of crew signed on and the average number of passengers, if any, times the agreed cost of one man per day times the number of days from the date the vessel was ready to sail to, but not including, the date of loss, plus the actual amount of subsistence stores transferred or sold.
              (b) Verified costs. In cases where the owner and the Chief, Division of Insurance, Maritime Administration, have not agreed in advance of the loss upon amounts representing, or the method for determining, the average daily consumption costs of Stores and Supplies for the owner's vessel, claims for total loss of such Stores and Supplies must be submitted by the owner on Affidavit in Proof of Claims for the Loss of Stores and Supplies, Exhibit B. In such cases, the value of the consumable stores will be determined as follows:
              (1) The value of consumable stores on board the vessel at the time the vessel was ready to sail, determined by certified inventories of the owner of amounts on board the vessel at the termination of the preceding voyage or date of last inventory, less actual consumption to date of sailing, plus a certified statement by the owner of actual additional purchases made from date of termination of the preceding voyage or date or last inventory to date vessel was lost, subject to audit by the Maritime Administration, less
              (2) The average daily consumption cost determined by dividing the amount determined as in paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the number of days for which the vessel was stored, times the number of days from the date the vessel was ready to sail to, but not including, the date of loss, plus actual amount of consumable stores transferred or sold.
              The values of subsistence stores, slop chest, bar stock, and fuel, at the time of loss are determined in the same manner, supported by certified inventories of the owner and invoices.

The Supervisor shall promptly advise the Commanding Officer or Superintendent whether or not such work comes under the heading of repairs, and if procurement of the material is authorized.
              (iii) Requisitions covering repairs, renewals, and betterments shall be prepared in quintuplicate by the heads of departments of the Training Ship and submitted by the Commanding Officer or Superintendent to the Supervisor at least forty-five (45) days before the date of the annual overhaul, with one copy to the Region Director.
              (iv) The State is authorized to expend not to exceed $5,000 for emergency repairs which become necessary while the Training Ship is on foreign cruise. The Administration shall reimburse the State upon submission of vouchers to, and approval by, the Maritime Administrator. To obtain reimbursement for emergency repairs estimated to cost in excess of $5,000, authorization must be obtained by the State from the Supervisor prior to undertaking such repairs. The Commanding Officer shall be responsible for all necessary filings with the United States Customs Service to avoid duties upon all emergency repairs performed outside the United States. If penalties are imposed, for non-filing or improper filing, they shall be solely the responsibility of the State.

              § 310.7
              Federal student subsistence allowances and student incentive payments.
              (a) Subsistence allowances—(1) Selection and allocation. In accordance with the Administration's established freshmen subsidy allocation for each School, the school shall select the individuals in its new entering class who will be enrolled in the United States Maritime Service as cadets and start to receive Federal student subsistence payments for uniforms, textbooks and subsistence as provided in the 1958 Act. The freshman subsidy allocations for each school are as follows: California Maritime Academy 99; Maine Maritime Academy 135; Massachusetts Maritime Academy 69; State University of New York Maritime College 200; Great Lakes Maritime Academy 45; and the Texas Maritime College 32. Each student who meets the entrance requirements in § 310.6(a) and applies for enrollment in the United States Maritime Service shall be entitled to consideration for a student subsistence payment at a rate and under the conditions in the 1958 Act. The list identifying the selected students shall be forwarded to the Administration on or before October 31, 1981. The Federal student subsistence payments will be paid to the School while a cadet is in attendance but not in excess of four (4) academic years for any one student.
              (2) Resignation or disenrollment. There will be no substitution for students removed or dropped from the list of those originally receiving Federal student subsistence payments. Subsidized students who resign or are disenrolled from a school shall not, on subsequent reenrollment, be in a position to reclaim their subsidy status.
              (3) Selection criteria; rate of payment. The selection of the students to receive such payments shall be made by the School in accordance with criteria established by the School, with the prior approval of the Administration. The rate of Federal student subsistence payments will be determined by the Administration according to the 1958 Act or the Act.
              (4) ROTC enrollment. Subsidized cadets who make a commitment to an Armed Force Reserve Officer Training Corps will be removed from the Administration subsidy rolls effective on the date they receive funds from a U.S. military service. Should they leave the program for any reason they may not reclaim the Administration subsidy as a cadet.
              (5) Payment procedure. The Administration shall make the Federal student subsistence payments no more frequently than monthly, directly to the School upon the presentation of a statement containing the names of each Cadet selected by the Academy (within the quotas furnished pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section) to be enrolled in the Maritime Service and to receive the Federal student subsistence payments. For newly selected Cadets in a new entering class, the statement supporting the first voucher for payment shall certify that the cadets have met the entrance requirements in § 310.6.
              (6) Certification procedure. All vouchers submitted for payment shall contain a certification by the Superintendent that the payment will be used to assist in defraying the cost of the uniforms, textbooks, and subsistence of each Cadet on the basis of the amount to which the cadet is entitled, as reflected by the attached Daily Attendance Report. No cadet shall receive a federal student subsistence payment for any time during which he or she is absent without leave or for absence due to a condition not in line of duty, or when determined by the School to be not in good standing.
              (7) Insufficient appropriations. If it appears that the amount appropriated by Congress under the Act shall not be sufficient to make payments at the maximum rate, not in excess of $1,200 per academic year per cadet, the Maritime Administrator, after consultation with the Schools, may determine the exact rate to be paid at each School for the remainder of the fiscal year.
              (b) Federal student incentive payments—(1) General provisions. In accordance with the Administration's established subsidy quotas for classes entering after April 1982, each school shall identify to the Administration, no later than February 1 annually, those students who have been selected to receive the student incentive payment authorized by the Act. The students so identified must meet the requirements of § 310.6(b). The Administration shall provide the school with the necessary service obligation contracts. The contracts will be signed by the designated students and returned by the School to the Supervisor and shall become effective when signed by the Supervisor or his or her designee. A copy shall be returned to the School for transmittal to the student. Payments will be issued to midshipmen in amounts equaling $4000 for each academic year of attendance whom execute the service obligation contracts providing for such payment amount. Payments shall commence to accrue on the day each such midshipman begins his or her first term of work at the School. Such payments shall be made quarterly to the midshipman until the completion of his or her course of instruction but in no event for more than four (4) academic years. The School shall submit a quarterly certified Daily Attendance Report listing the names of all designated midshipmen who are entitled to student incentive payments. Midshipmen who do not take all necessary steps to maintain their midshipman status, who lose their midshipman status due to action by the U.S. Navy, or who make the commitment identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section will have their student incentive payment terminated.
              (2) Temporary reallocation of Federal student incentive payments. If a School does not have a sufficient number of eligible freshmen to utilize all of its alloted payments, then the unused subsidies may be reallocated on a need basis to academies with eligible students. In the next academic year, each School's subsidy quota for entering students will revert to its original level.
              (3) Form of the service obligation contract. The service obligation contract shall obligate the midshipman to—
              (i) Use the student incentive payment to defray the cost of uniforms, books and subsistence;
              (ii) Complete the course of instruction at the School;
              (iii) Take the examination for a license as an officer in the merchant marine of the United States on or before the date of graduation from a School and fulfill the requirements for such license not later than three (3) months after such graduation;
              (iv) Maintain a valid license as an officer in the merchant marine of the United States for at least six (6) years following the date of graduation from a School, accompanied by the appropriate national and international endorsements and certification required by the United States Coast Guard for service aboard vessels on domestic and international voyages (“appropriate” means the same endorsements and certifications held at the date of graduation, or the equivalent);
              (v) Apply for an appointment as, and accept if tendered, and serve as a commissioned officer in the United States Naval Reserve (including the Merchant Marine Reserve, United States Naval Reserve), the United States Coast Guard Reserve, or any other Reserve unit of an armed force of the United States for at least six (6) years following the date of graduation from a school; and
              (vi) Serve in the foreign or domestic commerce or both, and the national defense of the United States for at least three (3) years following graduation from a School—
              (A) As a merchant marine officer serving on vessels documented under the laws of the United States or on vessels owned and operated by the United States or by any State or Territory of the United States;
              (B) As an employee in a United States maritime-related industry, profession, or marine science (as determined by the Maritime Administrator), if the Maritime Administrator determines that service under paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A) of this section is not available to such individual;
              (C) As a commissioned officer on active duty in an armed force of the United States or in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or in other maritime-related employment with the Federal Government which serves the national security interests of the United States, as determined to be satisfactory by the Maritime Administrator; or
              (D) By combining the services specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(vi)(A), (b)(3)(vi)(B) and (b)(3)(vi)(C) of this section; and
              (E) Such employment in the Federal Government must be both significantly maritime-related and serve the national security interests of the United States. “Significantly” is equated to a material or essential portion of an individual's responsibilities. It does not mean a “majority” of such individual's responsibilities, but means more than just an incidental part.
              (4) Marine-related employment. (i) graduates who intend to claim employment in a United States maritime-related industry, profession of marine science as meeting all or part of the service obligation under paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section, shall submit evidence to the Supervisor that they have conscientiously sought employment as a merchant marine officer, and that such employment is not available. Such evidence and other information available, shall be considered in any finding. In view of current and projected employment opportunities, afloat, the Maritime Administrator will grant the shoreside employment option infrequently and only on the basis of comprehensive evidence.
              (ii) The Maritime Administrator may consider the positions of operational, management and administrative responsibility in the following marine-related categories under the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section: Civilian employment in Federal and State agencies related to maritime affairs, steamship companies, stevedoring companies, vessel chartering and operations, cargo terminal operations, naval architecture, shipbuilding and repair, municipal and state port authorities, port development, marine engineering, and tug and barge companies. The above list is not all inclusive and is only intended to serve as a general guide.
              (5) Afloat employment year. For purposes of the service obligation, a satisfactory year of afloat employment shall be the lesser of—
              (i) 150 days; or
              (ii) The number of days employed afloat that is at least equal to the median number of days of seafaring employment under articles achieved by deck or engine officers in the most recent calendar year for which statistics are available.
              (6) Reporting requirement. (i) The schools must promptly submit copies of all resignation forms (containing the name, reason, address and telephone number) of juniors and seniors to the Supervisor, to be used for monitoring and enforcement purposes. Each graduate must submit an annual Service Obligation Compliance Report form (MA-930) to the Maritime Administration (Supervisor) between January 1 and March 1 following his or her graduation. After the initial report is submitted, each graduate must continue to submit annual reports during the same time frame between January 1 and March 1 for six (6) consecutive years thereafter, or until all components of the service obligation are fulfilled, whichever is latest. Each graduate will file a minimum of seven (7) reports in order to give information on all six (6) years of the armed forces reserve and merchant marine officer license service obligations. Graduates are encouraged to submit their Service Obligation Compliance Report forms (MA-930) to MARAD using the web-based Internet system at https://mscs.marad.dot.gov. Reports may also be mailed to: Compliance Specialist, Office of Policy and Plans, Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 7th St., SW., Room 7123, Washington, DC 20590. In case a deferment has been granted to engage in a maritime-related graduate course of study, annual reports must be submitted during the extension period resulting from such deferments. Examples of the reporting requirements are as follows.
              
              
                Example 1:
                Midshipman graduates on June 30, 2004. His or her first reporting date is between January 1, 2005 and March 1, 2005 and each following period between January 1 and March 1 for six (6) consecutive years thereafter (or until all components of the service obligation are fulfilled, whichever is latest) for a minimum of seven (7) reports.
              
              
                Example 2:
                Midshipman has a deferred graduation on November 30, 2004. His or her first reporting date is between January 1, 2005 and March 1, 2005 and each following period between January 1 and March 1 for six (6) consecutive years thereafter (or until all components of the service obligation are fulfilled, whichever is latest) for a minimum of seven (7) reports.
              
              
                Example 3:
                Midshipman has a deferment following graduation on June 30, 2004, to attend graduate school for two (2) years. His or her first reporting date is between January 1, 2005 and March 1, 2005 and during the same time frame between January 1 and March 1 for two (2) years during graduate school, and then during the same January 1 to March 1 time frame for six (6) consecutive years thereafter (or until all components of the service obligation are fulfilled, whichever is latest) for a total of nine (9) reports.
              
              

              (ii) The Maritime Administration will provide reporting forms. However, non-receipt of such forms will not exempt a graduate from submitting information as required by this paragraph. The reporting form has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (2133-0509).
              
              (7) Breach of contract—(i) Breach before graduation. (A) If the Maritime Administrator determines that any individual who has accepted Federal student incentive payments for a minimum of two (2) academic years has failed to fulfill any part of the contract set forth in § 310.7(b)(3), such individual may be ordered by the Secretary of Defense to active duty in one of the Armed Forces of the United States to serve a period of time not to exceed two (2) years. In cases of hardship as determined by the Maritime Administrator, the Maritime Administrator may waive this provision in whole or in part.
              (B) If the Secretary of Defense is unable or unwilling to order an individual to active duty under paragraph (b)(7)(i)(A) of this section, or if the Maritime Administrator determines that reimbursement of the cost of education provided would better serve the interests of the United States, the Maritime Administrator may recover from the individual the amount of student incentive payments, plus interest and attorney's fees.
              (C) The Maritime Administrator is authorized to reduce the amount to be recovered under paragraph (b)(7)(i)(B) of this section from such individual to reflect partial performance of service obligations and such other factors as the Maritime Administrator determines merit such reduction.
              (D) For purposes of paragraph (b)(7)(i)(A) of this section, an “academic year” is defined as the completion by a student of the required number of semesters, trimesters, or quarters, as applicable, whether at school or at sea, which comprise a complete course of study for an academic year. Thus, liability under paragraph (b)(7)(i)(A) of this section begins for students at the beginning of their third (3rd) academic year, whether at school or at sea.
              (ii) Breach after graduation. (A) If the Maritime Administrator determines that an individual has failed to fulfill any part of the service obligations (described in § 310.7(b)(3)), such individual may be ordered to active duty to serve a period of time not less than two (2) years and not more than the unexpired portion of the service obligation contract relating to service in the foreign or domestic commerce or the national defense, as determined by the Maritime Administrator. The Maritime Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall determine in which service the individual shall be ordered to active duty to serve such period of time. In cases of hardship, as determined by the Maritime Administrator, the Maritime Administrator may waive this provision in whole or in part.
              (B) If the Secretary of Defense is unable or unwilling to order an individual to active duty under paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(A) of this section or if the Maritime Administrator determines that reimbursement of the Cost of Education Provided would better serve the interests of the United States, the Maritime Administrator may recover from the individual the Cost of Education Provided, plus interest and attorney's fees.
              (C) The Maritime Administrator may reduce the amount to be recovered under paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) of this section from such individual to reflect partial performance of service obligations and such other factors as the Maritime Administrator determines merit such reduction.
              (8) Waivers. Waivers may be granted in cases where there would be undue hardship or impossibility of performance of the provisions of the contract due to accident, illness or other justifiable reason. Applications for waiver will be submitted to the Supervisor.
              (9) Deferments. In exceptional cases the Administration may grant a deferment of all or part of the service commitment under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) through (vi) of this section for a period not to exceed two years, only for graduates considered to have superior academic and conduct records while at the school, for the purpose of their entry after graduation into a marine-or maritime-related graduate course of study at an accredited graduate school. However, the Secretary of the department in which the United States Coast Guard is operating and the Secretary of Commerce, with respect to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has jurisdiction over such service shall approve any deferment of service as a commissioned officer. Applications for such deferment shall be made through the Superintendent of Midshipman's school, who shall forward each application together with the Superintendent's recommendation for approval or disapproval and an evaluation of the applicant's academic and conduct records, to the Supervisor for appropriate action.
              (10) Determination of compliance with service obligation contract; deferment; waiver; and appeal procedures. (i) An official of the Administration designated by the Supervisor shall:
              (A) Render determinations of whether a student or graduate has breached his or her service agreement;
              (B) Grant or deny a deferment of the service obligation under paragraph (b)(9) of this section, except obligations otherwise a part of the graduate Reserve officer status;
              (C) Grant or deny a waiver of the requirements of the service agreement in hardship cases.
              (ii)(A) If a student or graduate disagrees with the decision of the designated official, the student or graduate may appeal that decision to the Maritime Administrator. The appeal must set forth all the legal and factual grounds on which the student or graduate bases the appeal. Any grounds not set forth in the appeal are waived.
              (B) Appeals must be filed with the Maritime Administrator within 30 calendar days of the date of receipt by such student or graduate of the written decision of the designated official. Appeals must be filed at the Office of the Secretary, Maritime Administration, Room 7210, 400 7th St., SW., Washington, DC 20590. Each decision will include a notice of appeal rights.
              (C) A decision is deemed to be received by a student or graduate five (5) working days after the date it is mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address for such student or graduate listed with the Office of Policy and Plans. It is the responsibility of such student or graduate to ensure that their current mailing address is on file with the Office of Policy and Plans, 400 7th St., SW., Washington, DC 20590.
              (D) If the appeal is sent by conventional mail (through the United States Postal Service), the date of filing is determined by the postmark date. If no legible postmark date appears on the mailing, the appeal is deemed to be filed five (5) working days before the date of its receipt in the Office of the Secretary. If delivered by other than the United States Postal Service, an appeal is filed with the Maritime Administrator on the date it is physically delivered to the Office of the Secretary at the address referenced in paragraph (b)(10)(ii)(B) of this section. The date of filing by commercial delivery (not United States Postal Service) is the date it is received at the address for the Office of the Secretary set forth in paragraph (b)(10)(ii)(B) of this section. Appeals may not be submitted by facsimile or by electronic mail. Requests for extension of the time to file an appeal may be submitted by facsimile or electronic mail to the Office of the Secretary. Requests for extension of time do not stop or toll the running of the time for filing an appeal. Appeals may only be filed after the deadline if the Maritime Administrator or his designee, in their sole discretion, grants an extension.

              (E) In computing the number of days, the first day counted is the day after the event from which the time period begins to run. If the date that ordinarily would be the last day for filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the filing period will include the first workday after that date.
              
              
                Example to paragraph (b)(10)(ii)(E):
                If a graduate receives a decision on July 1, the 30-day period for filing an appeal starts to run on July 2. The appeal would ordinarily be timely only if postmarked on or physically delivered by July 31. If July 31 is a Saturday, however, the last day for obtaining a postmark by mailing or physical delivery would be Monday, August 2.
              
              
              (iii) The Maritime Administrator will issue a written decision for each timely appeal. This decision constitutes final agency action.

              (iv) If a student or graduate fails to appeal within the time set forth in paragraph (b)(10)(ii) of this section, the decision of the designated official will be final and constitute final agency action.
              
              (11) Remedies. To aid in the recovery of the cost of education under this section, the Maritime Administrator may request the Attorney General to begin court proceedings, and the Maritime Administrator may make use of the Federal debt collection procedure in chapter 176 of title 28, United States Code, or other applicable administrative remedies.

Serious or excessive violations of the rules and regulations by a Cadet or Midshipman may be considered as evidence of inaptitude for the demanding career of a merchant marine officer and warrant dismissal by the school.

              § 310.54
              General requirements for eligibility.
              (a) Citizenship. All candidates shall be citizens of the United States except: (1) Nominees from foreign nations; (2) nominees from the Northern Mariana Islands; (3) designees from the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; and (4) nominees from American Samoa, who may be American nationals. No person who is not a citizen shall be entitled to any office or position in the U.S. merchant marine by reason of his or her graduation from the Academy, until such person shall have become a citizen.
              (b) Age. On July 1 of the year of admission to the Academy, a candidate shall be not less than seventeen (17) years of age and shall not have passed his or her twenty-fifth (25) birthday.
              (c) Character. A candidate shall be of good moral character. The Administrator may reject the nomination of any candidate whose character is incompatible with the Academy's standards. No person who has been dismissed or compelled to resign from the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, the Academy or a State maritime academy for improper conduct shall be eligible for appointment as a midshipman at the Academy. No person whose last discharge from any armed force was under conditions other than honorable or who has had a merchant mariner document removed or suspended for cause shall be eligible for appointment as a midshipman.
              (d) Investigation. To be eligible for appointment, all candidates who are United States citizens shall be completely loyal to the United States and shall meet the requirements established by the Department of the Navy for designation as Midshipman, USNR (including the Merchant Marine Reserve, USNR). Candidates for appointment shall execute documents approved by the Administrator for the purpose of a security and suitability investigation. Appointment as a Midshipman, USNR (including the Merchant Marine Reserve, USNR) shall be a condition of admission for an individual who is a citizen. A candidate who is conditionally appointed to the Academy pending completion of a Navy security and suitability investigation shall be subject to immediate separation should the candidate, as a result of the investigation, fail to meet the requirements established for appointment as Midshipman, USNR.
              (e) Waivers. There shall be no waivers of general eligibility requirements.

              § 310.55
              Scholastic requirements.
              (a) Academic requirements—(1) Credits. Applicants shall have satisfactorily completed their high school education at an accredited secondary school, or equivalent, and shall present at least 15 units of credit for subjects acceptable to the Academy, comprised of:
              (i) 7 required units, as follows:
              (A) 3 units of Mathematics (from algebra, geometry and trigonometry);
              (B) 3 units of English; and
              (C) 1 unit of Physics or Chemistry.

              (ii) 8 other units, preferably chosen from the following fields:
              
              (A) Additional mathematics and science;
              (B) Foreign language;
              (C) Economics; and,
              (D) Social science.
              (2) Evidence of academic work. Before approval of an application, each applicant shall submit evidence showing completion of high school education, or showing that such education will be completed no later than June 30 of the year in which admission is sought.
              (b) Scholastic examinations—(1) Required entrance examinations. Applicants shall qualify in either the College Board's Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) or the American College Testing Program (ACT) examinations, administered nationally on scheduled dates at convenient testing centers. A candidate electing to use the College Board shall take both the mathematics and the verbal section of the SAT. A candidate electing to use the ACT, shall take all the tests, namely, English, Mathematics, Social Sciences and Natural Sciences. Minimum qualifying scores on the entrance examinations will be determined by the Superintendent of the Academy for each entering class prior to any offers of appointment for the particular class. Any score below the minimum on any one section of an examination shall make the nominee ineligible for admission. All examination costs shall be borne by the applicant. Nominees shall take all the required examinations by the February testing date in the year for which they seek appointment, unless the Academy's Admissions Office grants special authorization to take later examinations.
              (2) Forwarding test results. Candidates shall be responsible for requesting the testing services to submit their scores directly to the Academy.
              (3) Test information. Information on the entrance examinations may be obtained from—
              
              
                The candidate's high school guidance office; or,
                College Board, P.O. Box 592, Princeton, N.J. 08540; or,
                College Board, P.O. Box 1025, Berkeley, CA. 94701; or,
                American College Testing Program, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, IA 52240.
              
              
              (c) Prior Scholastic Record. Applicants shall demonstrate scholastic achievement by having attained a relatively high standing in relation to their fellow students and by having shown proficiency in mathematics and science courses. With respect to applicants who completed high school at least one year before applying for admission to the Academy, consideration will be given to satisfactory college level study or any special study undertaken to strengthen their academic backgrounds, particularly in respect to determining whether such supplementary academic activity offsets any deficiency in high school scholastic records.
              (d) Waivers. No waivers of scholastic requirements will be granted.
            
            
              § 310.56
              Physical requirements.
              (a) Physical standards. (1) A candidate shall meet the physical requirements prescribed by the Department of the Navy for appointment as Midshipman, USNR (including the Merchant Marine Reserve, USNR) and the requirements prescribed by the U.S. Coast Guard for original licensing as a third mate and third assistant engineer. All candidates shall have color perception and refractive error within the limits prescribed by the Department of the Navy or by the U.S. Coast Guard, whichever are higher.
              (2) The requirement to meet these standards is a continuing one and shall apply through graduation from the Academy. Failure to meet the standards while attending the Academy is grounds for, and may lead to disenrollment. Individuals who have completed at least two years of study and, as a result of an accident, illness or other cause (during official duty), fail to meet this requirement may be permitted to remain at the Academy at the discretion of, and under conditions set by, the Administrator. Those individuals permitted to remain through graduation will agree to fulfill aspects of the service obligation which they are capable of, as deemed appropriate by the Administrator.
              (b) Qualifying physical examinations. All candidates for the Academy shall have a physical and dental examination conducted by a service academy examining facility designated by the Service Academies Central Medical Review Board. The required physical examination shall occur within 1 year preceding the date of admission to the Academy. Although there is no charge for such examination, all expenses (including travel, meals and hotel accommodations) incurred in obtaining such examination shall be borne by the applicant. Candidates may be subject to reexamination upon reporting to the Academy and at any time while attending the Academy.
              (c) Physical reexamination. A candidate who is rejected for failure to meet the physical requirements may request either a reevaluation of the examination results or a reexamination. A midshipman failing to meet the physical requirements while attending the Academy is entitled to make the same request.
              (d) Waivers. Some medical requirements may be waived for enrolled students and applicants to the USMMA who require such a medical waiver to qualify for admission and/or retention. Since commissioning in the United States Navy, or any other branch of the Armed Forces, is a requirement for graduation, no waivers will be granted for medical conditions which would prevent commissioning in at least a restricted status in the U.S. Navy Reserve. Individuals interested in waiver consideration may request a waiver by writing to the Superintendent, USMMA. The granting of medical waivers will be based on U.S. Navy guidelines and regulations for waiver consideration for admission to the U.S. Naval Academy and the physical requirements consistent with commissioning as a reserve officer in the U.S. Navy in a restricted line program. Individuals requesting medical waivers must be able to meet all other admission requirements, including the physical examination requirement for an original U.S. Coast Guard merchant marine license as a third mate and/or third assistant engineer. The decision of the Superintendent on any requested waiver is administratively final.

              § 310.57
              Application and selection of midshipmen.
              (a) Application. All candidates shall submit an application for admission to the Academy's Admissions Office. Prospective candidates also should submit an application, but are not considered official candidates until their nominations are received. Candidates shall submit with their applications an official transcript and personality record from the candidate's high school and, if applicable, such records from any school attended after high school graduation. Application forms are available upon request by writing to the Admissions Office at the Academy. MARAD will accept electronic options (such as facsimile and Internet) for transmission of only Part I of required information to MARAD, if practicable.
              (b) Selection of Midshipmen. Selection of midshipmen for appointment to fill vacancies allotted to the various States and other locations, as specified in § 310.53(b) (1) and (2) of this subpart, shall be in order of merit. The order of merit shall be determined on the scores of the required entrance examinations, on assessment of the academic background of the individual and on such other factors as are considered by the Academy to be effective indicators of motivation and the probability of successful completion of training at the Academy. No preference shall be granted in selecting individuals for appointment because one or more members of their immediate families are alumni of the Academy.
              (c) Notification of selection. Results of the selection process will be made known about May 1 each year. The Academy shall advise each candidate and his or her nominating official of his or her status as a principal candidate, as an alternate candidate or as an unqualified candidate. Alternates will replace principal candidates who decline appointment or fail to meet the physical requirements or the security and suitability investigation.
              (d) Service obligation agreement. Each candidate selected for appointment to the Academy after April 1, 1982, who is a citizen of the United States, shall sign a service obligation contract as a condition of admission. The contract is prescribed in § 310.58 of this subpart.
              
              (e) Reporting to the Academy. Candidates who accept offers of appointment shall, pursuant to instructions issued by the Academy, report to the Academy on a specified date in mid-July for orientation and induction.
              (f) Oath. Each midshipman who is a citizen of the United States shall take the following oath of office at the Academy:
              
              
                “I, ___, having been appointed a midshipman to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, accept appointment and do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will comply with all the regulations of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter, so help me God.”
              
              
              (g) Birth Certificate. Each candidate shall present a certificate of birth authenticated by an authorized official.
              [47 FR 21812, May 20, 1982, as amended at 68 FR 62538, Nov. 5, 2003; 69 FR 61451, Oct. 19, 2004]
            
            
              § 310.58
              Service obligation for students executing or reexecuting contracts.
              (a) The service obligation contract shall obligate each midshipman who is a citizen and who executes or reexecutes a service obligation contract to:
              (1) Complete the course of instruction at the Academy;
              (2) Fulfill the requirements for a license as an officer in the merchant marine of the United States on or before the date of graduation from the Academy;
              (3) Maintain a license as an officer in the merchant marine of the United States for at least six (6) years following the date of graduation from the Academy accompanied by the appropriate national and international endorsements and certifications as required by the United States Coast Guard for service aboard vessels on both domestic and international voyages (“appropriate” means the same endorsements and certifications held at the date of graduation, or the equivalent);
              (4) Apply for an appointment as, accept any tendered appointment as and serve as a commissioned officer in the USNR (including the Merchant Marine Reserve, USNR), the United States Coast Guard Reserve, or any other Reserve component of an armed force of the United States for at least six (6) years following the date of graduation from the Academy;
              (5) Serve in the foreign or domestic commerce and the national defense of the United States for at least five (5) years following the date of graduation from the Academy:
              (i) As a merchant marine officer serving on vessels documented under the laws of the United States or on vessels owned and operated by the United States or by any State or territory of the United States;
              (ii) As an employee in a United States maritime-related industry, profession or marine science (as determined by the Maritime Administrator), if the Maritime Administrator determines that service under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section is not available;
              (iii) As a commissioned officer on active duty in an armed force of the United States or in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; or
              (iv) Other maritime-related employment with the Federal Government which serves the national security interests of the United States, as determined by the Maritime Administrator; or
              (v) By combining the services specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section; and,
              (vi) Such employment in the Federal Government that satisfies paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section must be both significantly maritime-related and serve the national security interests of the United States. “Significantly” is equated to a material or essential portion of an individual's responsibilities. It does not mean a “majority” of such individual's responsibilities, but means more than just an incidental part; and
              (6) Submit periodic reports to the Administration to establish compliance with all the terms of the contract.
              (b) Service as a merchant marine officer. For purposes of the service obligation set forth in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, a satisfactory year of service on vessels in the United States merchant marine as a merchant marine officer shall be the lesser of—
              (1) 150 days; or
              (2) The number of days that is at least equal to the median number of days of seafaring employment under articles achieved by deck or engine officers in the most recent calendar year for which statistics are available.
              (c) Marine-related employment. (1) Graduates who do not meet the sea service requirement in paragraph (b) of this section and who claim employment in a United States maritime-related industry, profession or marine science as meeting all or part of the service obligation under paragraph (a)(5) of this section and the serve obligation contract shall submit evidence to the Administration that they have conscientiously sought employment as a merchant marine officer, and that such employment is not available. Such evidence submitted, and other information available to the Administration, shall be considered in any finding. In view of current and projected employment opportunities afloat, the Administrator will grant the shoreside employment option infrequently and only on the basis of comprehensive evidence.
              (2) The Administrator may consider positions of operational, management or administrative responsibility, including, but not limited to, the following marine-related categories, to be under the provisions of § 310.58(a)(5)(ii) of this subpart and the service obligation contract: Civilian employment in Federal and State agencies related to maritime affairs; steamship companies; stevedoring companies; vessel chartering and operations; cargo terminal operations; naval architecture; shipbuilding and repair; municipal and State port authorities; and port development, marine engineering, and tug and barge companies.
              (d) Reporting requirements. (1) Each graduate must submit an annual Service Obligation Compliance Report form (MA-930) to the Maritime Administration between January 1 and March 1 following his or her graduation. After the initial report is submitted, each graduate must continue to submit annual reports during the same time frame between January 1 and March 1 for six (6) consecutive years thereafter, or until all components of the service obligation are fulfilled, whichever is latest. Each graduate will file a minimum of seven (7) reports in order to give information on all six (6) years of the service obligation. Graduates are encouraged to submit their Service Obligation Compliance Report forms (MA-930) to MARAD using the web-based Internet system at https://mscs.marad.dot.gov. Reports may also be mailed to: Compliance Specialist, Office of Policy and Plans, Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 7th St., SW., Room 7123, Washington, DC 20590.
              (i) Example 1: Midshipman graduates on June 30, 2004. His or her first reporting date is between January 1, 2005 and March 1, 2005 and thereafter between January 1 and March 1 for six (6) consecutive years (or until all components of the service obligation are fulfilled, whichever is latest) for a minimum of seven (7) reports.
              (ii) Example 2: Midshipman has a deferred graduation on November 30, 2004. His or her first reporting period is between January 1, 2005 and March 1, 2005 and thereafter between January 1 and March 1 for six (6) consecutive years (or until all components of the service obligation are fulfilled, whichever is latest) for a minimum of seven (7) reports.
              (iii) Example 3: Midshipman graduated in June 2003 and has already begun his or her service obligation reporting. His or her reports are now due between January 1 and March 1 of each reporting year.

              (2) The Maritime Administration will provide reporting forms upon request. However, non-receipt of such forms will not exempt a graduate from submitting service obligation information as required by this paragraph. Graduates are encouraged to submit their Service Obligation Compliance Report forms (MA-930) electronically at https://mscs.marad.dot.gov. The reporting form has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (2133-0509).
              (e) Breach of contract. (1) Breach before graduation: (i) If the Maritime Administrator determines that an individual who has attended the Academy for not less than two (2) academic years has failed to complete the course of instruction at the Academy, such individual may be ordered by the Secretary of Defense to active duty in one of the Armed Forces of the United States to serve for a period of time not to exceed two (2) years. In cases of hardship, as determined by the Maritime Administrator, the Maritime Administrator may waive this provision in whole or in part.
              (ii) If the Secretary of Defense is unable or unwilling to order an individual to active duty under the previous paragraph, or if the Maritime Administrator determines that reimbursement of the Cost of Education Provided by the Federal Government would better serve the interests of the United States, the Maritime Administrator may recover from the individual the Cost of Education Provided by the Federal Government.
              (iii) For purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, an “academic year” is defined as the completion by a student of a total of three (3) trimesters, whether at the Academy or at sea. Thus, liability under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section begins for students when they begin their seventh (7th) trimester, whether at the Academy or at sea.
              (2) Breach after graduation: (i) If the Maritime Administrator determines that an individual has failed to fulfill any part of the service obligation contract (described in § 310.58(a)), such individual may be ordered to active duty to serve a period of time not less than three (3) years and not more than the unexpired portion of the service obligation contract relating to service in the foreign or domestic commerce or the national defense, as determined by the Maritime Administrator. The Maritime Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall determine in which service the individual shall be ordered to active duty to serve such period of time. In cases of hardship, as determined by the Maritime Administrator, the Maritime Administrator may waive this provision in whole or in part.
              (ii) If the Secretary of Defense is unable or unwilling to order an individual to active duty under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section or if the Maritime Administrator determines that reimbursement of the Cost of Education Provided would better serve the interests of the United States, the Maritime Administrator may recover from the individual the Cost of Education Provided.
              (iii) The Maritime Administrator may reduce the amount to be recovered from such individual to reflect partial performance of service obligations and such other factors as the Maritime Administrator determines merit such reduction.
              (f) Waivers. The Maritime Administrator shall have the discretion to grant waivers of all or a portion of the service obligation contract in cases where there would be undue hardship or impossibility of performance due to accident, illness or other justifiable reason. Applications for waivers shall be submitted in writing to the Academies Program Officer, Office of Policy and Plans, Maritime Administration, 400 7th St., SW., Washington, DC 20590.
              (g) Deferments. In exceptional cases, the Administration may grant a deferment of all or part of the agreement under paragraph (a)(5) of this section and the service obligation contract, for a period not to exceed 2 years, only for graduates considered to have superior academic and conduct records while at the Academy and only for the purpose of entering a marine or maritime-related graduate course of study approved by the Administrator or for the purpose of pursuing studies as recipients of scholarships or fellowships of national significance; Provided, that any deferment of service as a commissioned officer under paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section and the service obligation contract shall be subject to the sole approval of the Secretary of the department which has jurisdiction over such service (including the Secretary of the department in which the U.S. Coast Guard is operating and the Secretary of Commerce with respect to NOAA). A graduate shall make application for such deferment through the Superintendent of the Academy, who shall forward each application, together with the Superintendent's recommendation for approval or disapproval and an evaluation of the applicant's academic and conduct records, to the Academies Program Officer, Maritime Administration, Office of Policy and Plans, NASSIF Building, 400 7th St., SW., Washington, DC 20590 for appropriate action.
              (h) Determination of compliance with service obligation contract; deferment; waiver; and appeal procedures. (1) A designated official of the Administration shall:
              (i) Determine whether a student or graduate has breached his or her service obligation contract;
              (ii) Grant or deny a deferment of the service obligation, except for obligations otherwise a part of the graduate's commissioned officer status; and,
              (iii) Grant or deny a waiver of the requirements of the service obligation contract in cases of undue hardship or impossibility of performance due to accident, illness or other justifiable reason.
              (2)(i) If a student or graduate disagrees with the decision of the designated official, the student or graduate may appeal that decision to the Maritime Administrator. The appeal will set forth all the legal and factual grounds on which the student or graduate bases the appeal. Any grounds not set forth in the appeal are waived.
              (ii) Appeals must be filed with the Maritime Administrator within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of receipt by such student or graduate of the written decision of the designated official. Appeals must be filed at the Office of the Maritime Administrator, Maritime Administration, Room 7210, 400 7th St., SW., Washington, DC 20590. Each decision will include a notice of appeal rights.

              (iii) A decision is deemed to be received by a student or graduate five (5) working days after the date it is mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address for such student or graduate listed with the Office of Policy and Plans. It is the responsibility of such student or graduate to ensure that their current mailing address is on file with the Office of Policy and Plans, Maritime Administration, 400 7th St., SW., Washington, DC 20590. Students and graduates can determine the current address on file with the Office of Policy and Plans by logging into the service obligation contract compliance Web site at http://mscs.marad.dot.gov.

            Section 1
            What this order does.
            This order requires that General Agents, appointed under Service Agreement “G.A.A., 3/19/51” shall not advance or entrust any monies or slop chest property of the United States to a master, purser or any other member of the ship's personnel unless such person is under a bond indemnifying the United States against loss of such monies or property caused solely or in part by the dishonesty or lack of care of any such person in the performance of the duties of any petition covered by the bond.
          
          
            Sec. 2
            Amount of bond.
            The amount of the bond must be governed by the amount of monies advanced or value of slop chest property entrusted, and shall, at all times, not be less than the value of slop chest property entrusted plus advances of monies for which a satisfactory accounting has not been made.
          
          
            Sec. 3
            Premiums.
            The bonds provided for shall be furnished without cost to the National Shipping Authority, but the cost of the premiums of such bonds shall be included in the overhead expense of the General Agent.
          
          
            Sec. 4
            Posting of bond.
            The General Agent shall retain an executed copy of each such bond in its principal office for examination by the National Shipping Authority at any time.

            Sec. 5
            Measures to protect ship's payrolls.
            (a) General Agents are not required to consider the amount of the payroll delivered to the Master at the conclusion of a voyage in determining the amount of bond required for any one person filling a bonded position hereunder. However, the person paying off the crew should be either the Master, or purser, or some other member of the ship's personnel acting for the Master who has been bonded pursuant to this order. If, however, the person paying off is a shoreside employee of the General Agent, such employee shall be bonded under the General Agents' general fidelity bond.
            (b) The principal risk involved where payrolls are delivered to a vessel at the conclusion of a voyage is loss through hold-up. Therefore, reasonable protection shall be taken by all General Agents where payrolls are delivered to a vessel or elsewhere. Because the circumstances of each case will vary, the General Agents shall use their best judgment in determining whether armored car service, armed guards or similar types of protection should be employed (in other words, the General Agents should follow their usual practices). The cost of these services may be included in vessel operating expenses.
            (c) General Agents are not required to purchase hold-up insurance, since subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of Service Agreement “G.A.A., 3/19/51” losses resulting from this exposure are assumed by the National Shipping Authority.
          
          
            Sec. 6
            Surety and form of bond.
            Each bond provided for by this order shall be duly executed by an authorized surety appearing on the current approved list of companies acceptable as sureties on Federal bonds published by the U.S. Treasury Department. The form of bond required by the National Shipping Authority to be used by the General Agents shall be as follows:
            
              
              Department of Transportation
              maritime administration, national shipping authority
              Position Fidelity Schedule Bond
              In consideration of the annual premium ___ (hereafter called the “Surety”) hereby agrees to pay to ___ or its successors (hereafter called the “Agent”) or the United States of America, (hereafter called the “United States”), represented by the Director, National Shipping Authority of the Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation (hereafter called the “Director”), as their interests may appear, the amount of any pecuniary loss of money or slop chest property caused, solely or in part, by reason of the dishonesty or lack of care of any person in the performance of the duties of any position, now or hereafter listed in the Schedule of Positions and Amounts forming part hereof (hereafter called the “Schedule”), on any and all vessels from time to time allocated to the Agent by the Director.
              This bond is executed and accepted subject to the following agreements, limitations and conditions:
              
                First. Liability under this bond begins with the _____ day of ________, 19__ in respect of each person then filling any position named in the Schedule on any and all vessels then allocated to the Agent by the Director. As to any position or positions bearing the same designation as that of any position or positions named in the Schedule on any vessel or vessels thereafter allocated to the Agent by the Director, liability under this bond shall automatically begin as soon as such position or positions are filled, provided the Director or the Agent shall within ninety (90) days of the date such position or positions are filled notify the Surety in writing of the date such position or positions are filled. As between the Agent and the Director, it shall be the responsibility of the Agent to give the notice to the Surety as provided herein. Without affecting its liability hereunder, the Surety agrees that neither the Agent nor the Director need furnish the names of vessels on which positions are bonded hereunder at any time during the effective period of this bond.
              
                Second. If the Agent or the Director shall request the Surety to increase or decrease the amount of coverage applicable to any position named in the Schedule, the Surety shall make such change by written acceptance showing the increase or decrease in the amount of coverage and the effective date thereof, which effective date shall not be prior to the date of such request; provided, however, that if the Director shall within ninety (90) days after receipt of notice of a decrease resulting from a request by the Agent, advise the Surety that it does not consent to such decrease, such decrease shall become inoperative and coverage shall continue in the amount applicable prior to such decrease as if such decrease had never been made.
              
                Third. If the Surety knows or has reason to believe that any person filling any position named in the Schedule has caused any loss of money or property entrusted to him by reason of his dishonesty or lack of care in the performance of the duties of such position, the Surety may terminate the coverage of this bond as to such person by giving notice in writing to the Agent and the Director at least thirty (30) days prior to the completion, in a continental United States port, of the then current voyage of the vessel on which such person is filling a position, in which case the coverage of this bond as to such person shall terminate when the crew is paid off upon such completion of the voyage. The Agent may cancel the coverage of this bond (a) as an entirety or (b) as to any position named in the Schedule by giving the Surety fifteen (15) days' written notice accompanied by written approval of the Director to such cancellation. The Director may cancel the coverage of this bond (a) as an entirety or (b) as to any position named in the Schedule upon fifteen (15) days' written notice to the Surety. In the event of any such cancellation the Surety shall refund to the Agent any unearned premiums computed pro rata.
              
                Fourth. After discovery and report to the Agent or the Director of any loss hereunder, the Agent or the Director shall give the Surety written notice thereof, and within ninety (90) days after such written notice to the Surety shall file with the Surety affirmative proof of loss itemized and sworn to on forms furnished by the Surety. Prior discovery and report to the Agent of such loss shall not affect the right of the Director to notify the Surety of such loss and to file proof of loss. As between the Agent and the Director, it shall be the responsibility of the Agent to give the notice and to file the proof of loss with the Surety as provided herein. “Discovery and report” as used herein is defined in paragraph Tenth hereof.
              
                Fifth. Any suit to recover on account of any loss hereunder shall be brought before the expiration of five years from the report to the Agent or the Director of the act causing such loss.
              
                Sixth. The Agent will declare at the original effective date of this bond, and at each subsequent premium anniversary date, the total number of persons then filling each position named in the Schedule, and the annual premium will be computed for the ensuing year on the basis of the aggregate coverage represented by such declaration. Upon such premium anniversary date there will be a computation of additional premium or refund of premium in proportion to the change in the coverage each year.
              
              
                Seventh. Settlement of any claim hereunder shall be made by check payable to the Agent unless otherwise instructed by the Director, but no settlement of any claim hereunder may be made for an amount less than the full amount of the loss for which the claim is made without the written consent of the Director thereto.
              
                Eighth. The Surety shall not be entitled to any reimbursement, salvage or recovery,—except from insurance, reinsurance, collateral or indemnity taken by the Surety for its own benefit,—on account of any loss hereunder until the Agent or the Director, as their interests may appear, is reimbursed in full.
              
                Ninth. No modification or change of any nature of the provisions of this bond shall take effect unless the Director shall have given his written consent thereto, except that the Agent may increase the coverage hereunder in accordance with the provisions of paragraph First hereof without such consent of the Director.
              
                Tenth. (a) Any action, approval or consent which by the provisions of this bond is required to be taken or signed by the Director shall be effective if taken or signed by the Director or by his authorized representative, and wherever and whenever herein any right, power, or authority is granted or given to the Director, such right, power, or authority may be exercised in all cases by his authorized representative, and the act or acts of such authorized representative, when taken shall constitute the act of the Director hereunder.
              (b) “Discovery and report” by the Agent as used herein shall be deemed to mean discovery by any person and the report of such discovery to an executive officer or head of a department or division concerned with such discovery and report of the Agent at the Agent's principal place of business within the continental United States. “Discovery and report” by the Director shall be deemed to mean discovery by any person and the report of such discovery to an executive officer or head of a division or section concerned with such discovery and report at the Director's headquarters.
              (c) Notices, approvals and requests required by the provisions hereof shall be sent to the Surety addressed to it at its home office at.
              (d) Notices, acceptances and requests required to be sent to the Agent shall be sent to The Agent, ________ (Name and head office address).
              (e) Notices and requests to be sent to the Director shall be addressed to the Director, National Shipping Authority of the Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation, at the Director's headquarters.

              A separate set of books of account shall be opened for the purpose of recording the various transactions in connection with the said agency agreement. The books of original entry and ledgers may be similar in design to those heretofore employed by the agent unless it develops that they are inadequate, in which event the deficiency shall be remedied promptly. The accounts required in operations under this agency agreement, however, shall conform to the chart in the uniform system prescribed by the Maritime Administration in General Order No. 22, Revised (46 CFR part 282) and recordings in the accounts shall be in accordance with the descriptions thereof contained in the said uniform system.
            
            
              Sec. 2
              Bank account.
              A separate joint bank account will be maintained in a depository or depositories designated by the agent and approved by the National Shipping Authority (referred to in this order as the owner), into which all collections under the agency agreement will be deposited and from which disbursements in connection with the activities, maintenance and business of the vessels thereunder will be made. Upon designation by the agent and approval by the owner of the depository or depositories, the owner will issue an order for the establishment of the joint bank account. The order will set forth the conditions governing the establishment and maintenance of the account and the making of deposits therein and withdrawals therefrom. A signed copy of the order of the owner will be furnished the agent and the agent promptly shall adopt, through its Board of Directors, a resolution satisfactory in form and substance to the owner, authorizing the establishment and maintenance of the account in conformity with the action of the owner. A signed copy of the order of the owner and a certified copy of the resolution of the agent will be furnished by the owner to the depository for its guidance in maintaining the fund and honoring instruments of withdrawal. The order will provide, among other things, that:
              (a) Withdrawals from this bank account may be made by the agent without the countersignature of the owner for disbursements in connection with the activities, maintenance and business of the vessels assigned under agency agreements, except disbursements involving payments to the agent directly, or to any other persons specifically designated by the Director, National Shipping Authority, in which instances the countersignature of a designated representative of the owner will be required, (b) withdrawals may be made from the account by the owner without the countersignature of the agent whenever and to the extent the owner shall determine that the balance in the account in excess of current operating requirements warrants such action, (c) the bank shall have no rights against the joint account on account of indebtedness of the agent either by way of set-off or otherwise, (d) the bank may receive for deposit in the joint account any funds tendered to it by any person with instructions that the same be deposited in the said account, and the bank shall have no responsibility to inquire as to the source of such funds, and (e) the bank shall disburse funds from the joint account in accordance with checks, drafts, or other orders for the payment of money, drawn as provided in the order, without making any inquiry as to the purpose or use to which such withdrawals are to be put.

              Sec. 3
              Accounting for revenues.
              (a) General. (1) The Agent shall be responsible for the prompt collection of all vessel operating revenue, shall issue such instructions as may be necessary to its branch houses or sub-agents, and shall take such other steps as may be necessary to insure prompt remittance to it of vessel operating revenue collected outside its principal office.
              (2) Freight revenue collected, less refunds made therefrom, shall be remitted to the owner promptly subsequent to the close of each month. Disbursements except for refunds shall not be made from freight revenue collections unless specifically authorized by the owner.
              (3) Passenger revenue collections shall be accounted for in accordance with procedures to be described.
              (4) The agent shall in all cases perform his audit and review functions promptly and shall be in a position to supply complete documentation for a current audit by representatives of the owner.
              (b) Revenue documents—(1) Freight revenue. The agent shall require its domestic and foreign branch houses, sub-agents, or other representatives, to prepare and submit revenue documents (manifests, bills of lading, out turn weight certificates, correction notices, etc.) to it. The manifest, in addition to showing the name of shipper, consignee, weight or measurement, freight rate and basis (whether the freight rate applies on measurement or weight basis), and amount of freight, shall show also advance charges, prepaid beyond charges, etc. A recapitulation sheet shall be made of the totals shown on the individual manifest sheets for each port. The aggregate totals of weight and measurement freight shall be converted to freight payable tons of bulk, general, heavy lifts, and commodities subject to special stevedoring rates if freight carried is subject to an over-all stevedoring agreement.
              (2) Passenger revenue. Agents to whom combination passenger and freight vessels have been assigned under agency agreements and who heretofore have established a passenger accounting procedure, may continue to follow such procedure under the agency operations, unless such procedure is found to be inadequate by the owner.
              (3) Certifications of revenue documents. The following certifications will be signed by branch houses or sub-agents:
              
              
                (i) Freight manifests. Certified to be a true and correct reflection of cargo loaded and rates charged.

              Disbursements at principal office of agent.
              All expenses directly applicable to the activities, maintenance and business of the vessels assigned under agency agreements shall be paid from funds advanced by the owner unless otherwise specifically provided. When paid by check, invoices shall reflect the numbers of the checks by which the invoices were paid; when paid other than by check of the agent at his principal office, invoices must bear evidence of payment.
            
            
              Sec. 6
              Disbursements at other domestic ports.
              Disbursements at domestic ports other than the principal office of the agent for expenses as referred to in section 5 shall be made by one of the three following methods:
              (a) After proper certification by the branch house or subagent, invoices shall be forwarded to the agent for payment, or

              (b) The branch house or subagent shall pay invoices and thereafter apply to the agent for reimbursement, supporting its voucher with invoices bearing evidence of payment covering individual disbursement, or
              (c) The agent may advance from time to time from the joint bank account the funds necessary to meet the requirements of such branch houses or subagents in connection with the activities, maintenance and business of the vessels assigned under the agency agreement. In such cases the branch house or subagent shall pay invoices from such advances and make proper accounting to the agent for each advance supported by invoices bearing evidence of payment and accompanied by remittance covering any unexpended balance of the advance, promptly after the departure of each vessel for which such advance was made.
            
            
              Sec. 7
              Disbursements at foreign ports.
              Disbursement procedures at foreign ports may differ in the case of individual agents and in view of existing conditions. Disbursements at foreign ports shall be made by one of the following methods or by any other method outlined to and approved by the owner in advance of its use:
              (a) The agent may advance from time to time from the joint bank account the funds necessary to meet the requirements of the business of the vessels assigned under the agency agreement. In such cases the foreign branch house or sub-agent shall pay invoices from such advances and shall make proper accounting to the agent for all advances supported by invoices bearing satisfactory evidence of payment. Any gains or losses in exchange on such advances or disbursements shall be for the account of the owner.
              (b) The foreign branch house or sub-agent may pay all invoices from his own funds and thereafter draw on the agent for reimbursement, at the same time forwarding the disbursements account by air mail.
              (c) The agent may establish Letters of Credit making funds available to the foreign branch house or sub-agent against which funds may be drawn by the sub-agent for branch house for payment of properly approved documents.

              (ii) Name of port at which the services, supplies, or facilities were furnished.
              (iii) Date of delivery or service.
              (iv) Necessary details as to the nature of services, supplies, or facilities furnished including quantity, rate, price and total amount.

              (2)(i) In addition to the foregoing, contractors or vendors shall certify each invoice or voucher (original only) in the following manner:
              
              

                I certify that the above bill is correct and just and that payment therefor has not been received.

              (iii) In instances where the foregoing certification is unobtainable for foreign purchases only, it may be waived: Provided, That, in lieu of such certification the agent certifies the invoice as follows:

              (5) If the laws of any country require the foreign sub-agent or branch house to retain the original invoice with stamps affixed, or if such laws require the original receipt as prima facie evidence of payment, the corresponding duplicate copy of the invoice, in proper form, must be forwarded to the agent with notation to that effect made thereon by the foreign sub-agent or branch house.

In instances in which the agent may not be able to identify in advance the representative who may sign, the agent shall have the responsibility for determining that the person signing was qualified to execute evidence of delivery of supplies, performance of services, or use of facilities involved.

              (2) For charges for watching cargo, stevedoring, wharfage, receiving and delivering cargo, clerking and checking, or other services or facilities not rendered directly to the vessel, for which normally delivery receipts or any equivalent form are not furnished, the following certification on the face of the original invoice by a duly authorized representative of the agent is required.

            § 326.1
            Purpose.
            This part states that the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall be responsible for providing or obtaining marine protection and indemnity (P&I) insurance for any vessel that has been placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF), which includes the Ready Reserve Force component, which vessel is assigned under a General Agency Agreement. These various forms of Agreements are entered into by the United States, acting by and through the National Shipping Authority, MARAD, and a private company (Agent). An agreement also contains procedures for the Agent to report accidents and occurrences of a P&I nature to MARAD and to report and settle P&I claims.
          
          
            § 326.2
            Insurer.
            MARAD shall be responsible for providing or obtaining P&I insurance for all vessels assigned to Agents under an Agreement. At its election, MARAD may be a self-insurer of any one or more vessels covered by the Agreement, or may obtain P&I insurance coverage under one or more policies written by underwriters of marine insurance. MARAD shall determine the amount of coverage to be provided or obtained.
          
          
            § 326.3
            Insured.
            The insureds are: The United States of America, acting by and through the Director, National Shipping Authority, Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation, and its Agents (including Agents' employees). Sub-agents shall be insureds only as expressly provided in the Agreement. Independent contractors of the Agents are not insureds.
          
          
            § 326.4
            Reports of accidents and occurrences.
            The Agent shall report every accident or occurrence of a P&I nature promptly to both the Director, Office of Trade Analysis and Insurance, Maritime Administration, 500 Seventh Street, SW., Room 8121, Washington, DC 20590, Tel. (202) 366-1461, and the contracting officer named in the Agreement. If MARAD has obtained P&I insurance through a marine insurance underwriter, the Agent also shall concurrently file a report of such accident or occurrence with the underwriter. MARAD shall disclose full details as the identity of such underwriter to the Agent.
          
          
            § 326.5
            Report of claims.
            The Agent also shall submit a quarterly report of all claims of a P&I insurance nature to the Director, Office of Trade Analysis and Insurance. The report shall contain all relevant information, e.g., the names of the vessels and of the claimant, the date of the injury or occurrence, the amount claimed, the basis for any payments already disbursed in behalf of the United States, estimated future costs and an evaluation of the claim of the merits.
          
          
            § 326.6
            Settlement of claims.
            (a) After ascertaining from MARAD the availability of funds, the Agent is authorized to settle individual claims of a P&I insurance nature that do not exceed $5,000. For a settlement in excess of $5,000, the Agent shall obtain MARAD's prior approval through the Director, Office of Trade Analysis and Insurance. If MARAD has placed the P&I insurance with an insurance underwriter, the Agent also shall obtain the prior approval of the underwriter to settle claims.
            (b) The amount of individual claims that do not exceed the Agent's limit for settlement shall be chargeable by the Agent to the vessel expense and shall be accounted for in accordance with current accounting instructions of MARAD.
            (c) When settling any such claim, the Agent shall advise the claimant that such settlement shall be accounted for in accordance with current accounting instructions, and shall also advise the claimant that such settlement is not to be construed as an admission of liability by or on behalf of the United States, the Agent or any other person.

            (d) The Agent shall apply sound judgment and follow standard practices of vessel operators in the settlement or other disposition of such P&I insurance claims, and shall settle such claims only when the settlement is adequately supported by all the facts and circumstances and is in the best interest of the United States.
          
          
            § 326.7
            Litigation.
            (a) If a court suit of a P&I nature is filed which arises out of the activities of the Agent under its Agreement, wherein the Agent is named as the party defendant or one of the parties' defendant irrespective of whether the risk is covered by P&I insurance, the Agent shall immediately forward copies of the pleading and all other related legal documents, by first class mail, to the Chief Counsel, Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590, and to the Attorney General, Attn: Civil Division, Torts Branch, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. No agent or authorized subagent shall incur any legal expenses in connection with any claim of a P&I nature, unless approved in advance by MARAD, and by the underwriter, where applicable. However, the Agent may incur legal expenses if the mission of the vessel will be frustrated or impeded and/or time will not permit such prior approval.
            (b) In the event of any attachment or seizure of a vessel, whether or not the risk is of a P&I nature, the Agent shall immediately notify the Chief Counsel, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590, Tel. (202) 366-05711, by telegram, radio, or cable.

              (a) The claims of an insured (subrogor) and an insurer (subrogee) for damages arising out of the same incident constitute a single claim.
              (b) An insured (subrogor) and an insurer (subrogee) may file a claim jointly or separately. If the insurer has fully reimbursed the insured, payment will only be made to the insurer. If separate claims are filed, the settlement will be made payable to each claimant to the extent of that claimant's undisputed interest. If joint claims are filed, the settlement will be sent to the insurer.
              (c) Each claimant shall include with a claim, a written disclosure concerning insurance coverage including:

Documentary evidence of payment to a subrogor does not constitute evidence of liability of the United States or conclusive evidence of the amount of damages. The Maritime Administration makes an independent determination on the issues of fact and law based upon the evidence of record.

              § 327.43
              Insurance and other subrogated claims.
              (a) The claims of an insured (subrogor) and an insurer (subrogee) for damages arising out of the same incident constitute a single claim.
              (b) An insured (subrogor) and an insurer (subrogee) may file a claim jointly or separately. If the insurer has fully reimbursed the insured, payment will only be made to the insurer. If separate claims are filed, the settlement will be made payable to each claimant to the extent of that claimant's undisputed interest. If joint claims are filed, the settlement will be sent to the insurer.
              (c) Each claimant shall include with a claim, a written disclosure concerning insurance coverage including:
              (1) The names and addresses of all insurers;
              (2) The kind and amount of insurance;

              (4) Whether a claim has been or will be presented to an insurer, and, if so, the amount of that claim; and whether the insurer has paid the claim in whole or in part, or has indicated payment will be made.
              (d) Each subrogee shall substantiate an interest or right to file a claim by appropriate documentary evidence and shall support the claim as to liability and measure of damages in the same manner as required of any other claimant. Documentary evidence of payment to a subrogor does not constitute evidence of liability of the United States or conclusive evidence of the amount of damages. The Maritime Administration makes an independent determination on the issues of fact and law based upon the evidence of record.

            Operation under current GAA/MSTS Southeast Asia Program.
            In order to adapt the provisions of NSA Order 35 (OPR-2) to the particular circumstances of the present GAA/MSTS Southeast Asia Program, the following material partially modifying certain sections of that order is published.
            For General Agency operations not related to the current GAA/MSTS Southeast Asia Program, NSA Order 35 (OPR-2) remains unchanged and wholly applicable. Except where specifically altered by the material which follows, it also remains applicable to the present situation.

            For voyages made under the current GAA/MSTS program only, the following provisions concerning voyage commencements and terminations shall apply in lieu of those appearing in sections 3 and 4 of NSA Order 35 (OPR-2). Continental United States ports do not include ports in the states of Alaska or Hawaii.
            (a) The commencement of the initial voyage shall occur in a continental U.S. port at 0001 hours of the day the vessel is tendered and accepted for use by MSTS.

            (1) Paying off of the crew from sea articles.
            (c) Since, in all instances, the voyage termination procedure takes precedence over the voyage commencement procedure and since it is mandatory that voyages terminate in a continental U.S. port, the following exception to the requirement of paragraph (b) of this section shall be effective when warranted:
            (1) If the vessel completes payoff as in paragraph (b) of this section and takes departure within the same calendar day, the General Agent shall immediately inform the nearest Coast Director of Area Representative of the circumstances and submit recommendations regarding voyage termination. The resulting recommendations, decisions, and instructions shall be confirmed in writing to the General Agent, copy to Division of Operations, Washington, DC 20590.
            (d) Where a vessel is employed in intermediate voyages or in cross trading outside the continental United States, the original voyage shall continue until terminated under conditions in paragraph (b) of this section.

            (b) If a seaman is repatriated as a passenger, or as a repatriate seaman (non-working), aboard a vessel operated for the account of the National Shipping Authority under a General Agency Agreement, a flat transportation charge of $5.00 per day shall be made for every day spent aboard the repatriating vessel, including day of embarkation and day of debarkation, which charge shall be in addition to necessary train or other conveyance expense, United States and foreign government taxes, port dues, landing fees or other charges of every nature levied in connection with such repatriation. In such a case, the General Agent of the vessel of which the repatriate was last a crew member shall be billed for the amount of expense involved, and appropriate entries covering the receipts and disbursements resulting from the repatriation shall be made in the proper books of account by the General Agent concerned. In the event the General Agent repatriating a seaman is also the General Agent of the vessel on which the seaman last served, it will not be necessary to issue a formal billing, but it is required that appropriate entries be made on the agency books of account to reflect a revenue of $5.00 per day in the account of the vessel rendering the transportation service and that a charge covering the cost of repatriation be recorded against the vessel on which the seaman last served. In all cases, the General Agent charged with the repatriation expense shall take necessary steps to secure reimbursement of such expense from the P & I underwriters insuring the vessel against which the expense is charged. No charge is to be made in the case of a seaman repatriate who signs on vessel articles as a workaway or in any other capacity except as a repatriate seaman (non-working). When repatriation is required, it shall be effected by the first available means considered appropriate by the official authorizing such repatriation.
          
          
            Sec. 6
            General provisions.
            (a) In case of repatriation of any seaman as a passenger aboard a vessel operated for account of the National Shipping Authority, the requirements of the applicable collective bargaining agreement or employment contract shall be met. In any event, a seaman repatriate shall receive at least as good accommodations as would be his due while sailing in his capacity.
            (b) Unless otherwise directed, a seaman when repatriated as a passenger aboard a vessel operated for the account of the National Shipping Authority, shall be issued a ticket in the form prescribed by the General Agent of the vessel for its own vessels. Such ticket shall be surrendered to the master of the repatriating vessel. When repatriated as a repatriate seaman (non-working), the master of the repatriating vessel shall be furnished with a certificate from the official authorizing the repatriation setting forth that the circumstances require that the seaman be signed on as a repatriate seaman (non-working). The master shall ascertain the seaman's full name and rating, cause of repatriation, and the names of the vessels and the General Agent to be charged with the cost of the repatriation.
            (c) It is recognized that the procedure set forth in this order will not cover all situations arising out of obligations to repatriate seamen nor fix ultimate responsibility for repatriation expenses which may sometimes depend upon determinations of fact which cannot be made prior to repatriation. In cases of emergency or in situations not covered in this order, the General Agent shall proceed in accordance with established commercial practice.
            (d) Nothing in this order shall be construed to interfere with the proper exercise of authority by United States consular officials relative to repatriation of seamen in accordance with applicable statutes.

            General Agents' authority.
            The General Agents are hereby delegated authority to undertake for the account of the National Shipping Authority only such emergency repairs outside the Continental United States as may be necessary to enable vessels to complete their voyages, provided the repair costs are not in excess of $5,000 per vessel.
          
          
            Sec. 3
            General Agents' responsibilities.
            In the event the cost of emergency repairs to a vessel in a foreign port is estimated to exceed $5,000, requests for approval shall be transmitted by General Agents by cable or wire addressed to Chief, Division of Ship Repair and Maintenance, National Shipping Authority, Washington, DC 20590, and shall include the following information:
            (a) The cost and time to effect permanent repairs on a straight time and overtime basis;
            (b) The cost and time to effect such temporary repairs on a straight time and overtime basis as will enable the vessel to return to the United States under its own power or under tow;
            (c) Whether required repairs can be effected by the use of facilities under the direct control of the Army, Navy, or other agencies of the United States Government, and if so, at what cost and time; and

            The General Agents shall keep the Division of Ship Repair and Maintenance in Washington fully posted in detail as to the nature, extent, cost, and estimated time for completion of all foreign repairs where such repairs are for the account of the National Shipping Authority.
            As soon as practicable after completion of either temporary or permanent repairs, the General Agent shall forward to the Division of Ship Repair and Maintenance, Washington, DC the following:
            (a) A copy of the repair specifications;
            (b) An itemized statement of the costs of the repairs supported by copies of invoices;

            (d) A report indicating the causes and circumstances leading to the repairs.
            General Agents shall forthwith instruct their subagents and other representatives in foreign areas and their Masters and Chief Engineers with respect to their operations, pursuant to this directive.
            This directive is intended strictly to limit repairs in foreign waters on vessels under National Shipping Authority control to those absolutely necessary to enable the vessels to complete their respective voyages at a port in the United States.
            This directive shall not be construed to affect outstanding directives of the Office of the Comptroller.

            Section 1
            What this order does.
            This order outlines the procedure to be followed by General Agents in filing foreign repair entries and obtaining relief from Custom's duties on equipment purchased for or repairs made to ships owned by or Bareboat Chartered to the U.S. Maritime Administration and operated under General Agency Agreement.
          
          
            Sec. 2
            Submission of repair entries.
            At the first United States port of arrival upon termination of a foreign voyage, the ship's Master must file with the District Director of Customs as defined in 19 CFR 1.1(d) an affidavit on Custom's Form 3417 certifying that no equipment was purchased for or repairs made to the ship at a foreign port or if this is not the case, an affidavit on Custom's Form 3415 describing the equipment purchased and/or repairs made. If equipment was purchased and/or repairs were made in a foreign port, the Master simultaneously with or shortly after filing of Custom's Form 3415, must file a repair entry on Custom's Form 7535 together with invoices and required supporting documents.

            Sec. 3
            Application for remission of duties.
            An application for relief from the payment of duties imposed is to be filed with the District Director of Customs as defined in 19 CFR 1.1(d) if the following circumstances prevail:
            (a) When an item covered by the entry is not within the class of items liable to duty (i.e., that the item does not constitute equipment, repair parts or materials within the meaning of section 466 of the Tariff Act of 1930);
            (b) When the purchase of the equipment, repair parts or materials or the making of the repairs was necessitated by stress of weather and/or other casualty encountered during the regular course of the particular voyage and was necessary to secure the safety and seaworthiness of the vessel; or
            (c) When the equipment, repair parts or materials were manufactured or produced in the United States and the labor involved was performed by residents of the United States or by members of the regular crew of the vessel.
            To insure consideration in the liquidation (i.e., the assessment of duty) of the entry, the application for relief must be filed within 90 days from the date of the entry, except in meritorious cases, the District Director may grant an extension of 90 more days upon written request therefor.
            [16 FR 9658, Sept. 21, 1961, as amended at 33 FR 5952, Apr. 18, 1968. Redesignated at 45 FR 44587, July 1, 1980]
          
          
            Sec. 4
            Evidence required.
            When relief is claimed on the grounds of stress of weather or other casualty, there must be submitted to the Collector the following:

            (a) An affidavit of the Master which shall set out fully the nature of the casualty and/or stress of weather encountered; when and where the casualty and/or stress of weather occurred; nature of the damage sustained; the port where the repairs were made or the equipment purchased and a statement of the Master as to whether the repairs or equipment purchased were required to secure the safety or seaworthiness of the vessel to enable her to reach a port of destination in the United States;
            (b) Itemized invoices covering the cost of repairs made or equipment purchased;
            (c) Abstracts of the vessel's log;
            (d) Classification surveyor's report confirming vessel's classification when the repairs were made in order to insure seaworthiness.
            The Master shall certify as true copies or originals, as the case may be, one copy of each repair bill, abstract of vessel's log, survey report and other documents used in support of the application for relief. If a document is written in a foreign language, it should be accompanied by a translation certified to be accurate.

            General Agent's authority to effect payment of duties.
            (a) In those cases where the conditions outlined in section 3 of SRM-4 do not prevail, the General Agent shall effect payment of duties imposed by Customs and shall include the expenditure in the voyage accounts of the vessel. In those cases where the conditions as outlined in section 3 of SRM-4 do prevail, the General Agent shall exhaust every means toward obtaining remission of duty imposed.

            (b) Should the General Agent fail to obtain remission of duties in such cases, he shall refer the matter to the appropriate Coast Director for his (The Director) determination as to whether further appeal to the Bureau of Customs is warranted or that payment of duty should be made by the General Agent.

            (a) The NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract is a Master form of fixed price contract and is applicable to ship repair work awarded as a result of competitive bidding or negotiation. As a general rule all work awarded under the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract must be awarded upon the basis of competitive bids. Revised Statute section 3709 (41 U.S.C. 5), which requires the award of contracts on the basis of competitive bids, however, permits award upon a negotiated basis in certain situations, that is, “where immediate delivery or performance is required by the public exigency.”
            (b) There are set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) to (3) of this section three (3) examples of situations where the negotiation of fixed price awards for the accomplishment of work under the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract will be permitted in lieu of competitive bidding:
            (1) Where the desired results from competitive bidding cannot be obtained. For example, where there is doubt as to the reality of competition or the fairness or reasonableness of a low bid, all bids shall be rejected. If the ship's availability permits a new Invitation for Bids for the work in question shall be issued. If the bids received as a result of the second invitation are not considered satisfactory the bids are to be again rejected and prices of all specification items are to be negotiated with and the job awarded to the lowest bidder. If the low bidder refuses to accept the award upon the condition referred to the offer of award subject to price negotiation may be made to the next lowest bidder, etc. Negotiated awards in such cases shall be made in accordance with the conditions set forth on the invitation form, e.g., time specified, liquidated damages, etc. If a satisfactory price cannot be secured by negotiation with the bidders as herein proved an award may be made upon a negotiated basis approved in section 5 of this order.
            (2) Where the element of time is paramount. There will be instances where expeditious ship turnarounds will necessitate the award of work without the delay involved in awarding on the basis of competitive bids. In such cases immediate negotiation for a fixed price with one contractor will be permissible. However, full consideration must be given to the factors involved in order to determine whether, under the circumstances, the time requirements make necessary the negotiation of price rather than using the competitive bid procedure. Such relevant factors are the individual ship's commitments with respect to loading berths, sailing dates, and the charter hire, etc., that might accrue in the event additional ship lay-time is required because of competitive bidding. Definite dollar and time values cannot be established as specific guides for determining when to negotiate. The individual ship and circumstances involved are the governing elements. The practice of consistently favoring one contractor where this type of repair is required will not be permitted but instead, to the maximum extent possible, all qualified contractors in the particular port shall be given the opportunity to perform work for the National Shipping Authority.
            (3) Extra items of work found subsequent to the awarding of the work covered by the original specifications. Where extra items of work are required after the commencement of the awarded work, it is permissible to negotiate with the contractor who is performing the awarded work, for the accomplishment of such extra work under the provisions of Article 6 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract. A discussion of this procedure is set out in section 8 of this order. However, where items of extra work are found after examinations have been made as called for by the original specifications, negotiation with the contractor to perform such items of extra work shall be permitted only if the aggregate estimated cost of such items of extra work would not amount to a substantial part of the entire job. If the items of extra work amount to a substantial part of the entire job, they shall be awarded in the same manner and after consideration of the same factors as are set forth above for awarding original work.
          
          
            
            Sec. 3
            Specifications.
            (a) It shall be incumbent upon the representatives of the Authority on each and every vessel requiring repairs for the account of the National Shipping Authority to prepare complete, detailed and fully descriptive specifications of the particulars of each repair item, identified in each particular case by the appropriate voyage number. Decisions of the Coast Directors' Ship Repair and Maintenance Staffs with respect to the need for any particular item in repair specifications shall be final. The specifications for voyage repairs shall itemize the work involved and shall be numbered consecutively and shall be arranged in accordance with the group classification set forth in section 18 of this order with the segregation by the three departments, namely, deck, engine and steward.
            (b) The specifications shall in their final written form be explicit in every respect and shall include drydocking, if required, as well as all other items of work known to be required or discernible through visual inspection and examination regardless of the fact that later decision may be made to eliminate or defer some of the items of work. In no case shall an item of work, the accomplishment of which is problematical, be so identified or segregated in the specifications. Resorting to such general phraseology as “overhaul as necessary,” “open up for examination and repair or renew as necessary,” “repair or renew,” etc., shall not be permitted in preparing and writing the specifications.
            (c) Where an exact and final determination of the extent of the work cannot be ascertained until an examination has been made, the particular items involved shall so specify and the specifications with respect to said items shall be limited to such examinations as are necessary.
            (d) If it is desired by the representatives of the Authority to change any item in the specifications after the specifications have been issued to bid such changes shall be reduced to writing and shall be distributed to the invited bidders at least by such time prior to the time originally specified for the opening of bids as shall reasonably permit the bidders to revise their estimates. If determined to be necessary or desirable under the circumstances, the representative of the Authority may extend the time for opening of bids.
            (e) Any exceptions taken to the specifications by a prospective bidder shall be made known to the represent- ative of the Authority prior to the time specified for opening the bids. If it is finally determined by the representative of the Authority that the exceptions are justified, then the procedure set forth in the preceding sub-paragraph shall be followed. Exceptions accompanying bids not processed as herein prescribed, but made known at the time the bids are opened will not be acceptable, and will be a cause for rejecting such bids.
            (f) When it is anticipated that the cost of a job will be in excess of a Coast Director's delegated authority, one (1) copy of specifications, and in case of bids a copy of Invitation for Bids, Instructions to Bidders and listing of contractors invited to bid shall be forwarded to the Chief, Division of Ship Repair and Maintenance, Washington, DC, simultaneously with the specifications being issued to the contractors.
            (g) In all cases where materials, parts or equipment are required in connection with the performance of any particular repair item the representatives of the Authority shall utilize to the fullest possible extent spares and replacement parts stocked in Maritime Administration warehouses. Prior to arranging for the purchase or furnishing of repair parts by repair contractors, it shall be the responsibility of the representatives of the Authority awarding work to determine that the required parts are not available in the Maritime Administration warehouse in the area involved, contingent upon the urgency of the particular situation, ship's sailing schedule, etc.
          
          
            Sec. 4
            Procedure for securing competitive bids.

            (a) The geographical area within which bids will be invited involves the exercise of sound administrative judgment. All the relevant factors should be considered in deciding over what areas competitive bids should be invited. Such factors will include the scope and nature of the work, the location of the vessel, and the time and expense involved in shifting and returning the vessel to its loading berth consistent with the operating requirements.
            (b) Invitations for Bids shall be sent to all contractors, within the area as determined in paragraph (a) of this section, who are considered to be financially qualified and to be capable of performing all of the work set forth in the specifications either by the utilization of their own or subcontractors' facilities. In this regard attention is invited to section 15 of this order.
            (c) When inviting Bids the NSA form entitled “Invitation for Bids, Instruction for Bidders, and Specifications for Repairs, Renewals, Alterations and Additions to the Vessel _____” shall be used.
            (d) Attention is called to the fact that the Invitation for Bids form includes a statement of the completion date for the work. In the event bids are invited the individual vessel's period of availability and the extent of the proposed work shall be considered in fixing a completion date that is consistent with the scope of the work involved. Consideration must be given to the fact that it will not be possible in every case to get lower bids by extending a completion date beyond the normal time required to do the work merely because the vessel's availability is exceptionally long. At the same time, care is to be exercised to insure that the repair period is not shortened, when there is no urgent need for the use of the vessel, to such an extent that it is impossible for the contractor to accomplish the work under normal working conditions. A completion date can only be fixed so as to be financially and otherwise to the best interests of the Government after due consideration has been given to all of the factors involved.
            (e) The Invitations for Bids shall provide that the contractors shall submit, simultaneously with their responses to Invitations for Bids, unit prices for each item of specification work in a separate sealed envelope. Only the envelope containing the separate item prices of the contractor determined to be the low bidder shall be retained by the representative of the Authority and shall not be opened until after the award is made. All other envelopes containing separate item prices shall be returned un- opened to each contractor by the representative of the Authority. In the event the low bid is rejected, the itemized prices of the low bidder shall be returned to him in the unopened envelope. Item prices submitted by contractors will not be subject to public perusal.
            (f) Vessel repair work contracted for by representatives of the National Shipping Authority is subject to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, except in those cases where at the time of the issuance of the Invitations for Bids the site of the work is not known. Where bids are being invited from bidders in more than one port area, the port area in which the award will be made will not be known, and the Invitations for Bids, accordingly, must state that the work in question is not subject to the Davis-Bacon Act.
            (g) The Invitations for Bids shall also include a statement of the per day liquidated damages, for the particular type vessel on which the work is to be performed.
            (h) The Invitation for Bids shall state where the bids are to be opened.
            (i) When Invitations for Bids are issued by a General Agent, the General Agent, at the time the invitations are issued shall make available to the local Ship Repair and Maintenance office, three (3) copies of the specifications, three (3) copies of a list of contractors to whom invitations have been sent, and three (3) copies of the Invitation for Bids.

            (j) Where the scope and probable cost of the work and the time required for effecting such work are secondary as compared to the ship's time, and where the preparation of formal specifications and the issuance of formal Invitations for Bids are not practicable, the representative of the Authority may orally contact as many qualified contractors as is feasible, in order to obtain written “Spot Bids.” Each contractor who indicates its intention to bid shall be fully advised as to the specific work involved and given an opportunity to inspect the vessel to enable it to prepare a bid. The contractor shall be verbally advised of a time and place for the submission of the “Spot Bids.” If such bids are invited by the General Agent, the General Agent shall also advise the Coast Director or his duly appointed representative of the time and place of opening the “Spot Bids,” and if practicable, the NSA representative shall attend such opening. If submission of such spot bids is not in writing the contractors shall immediately confirm their respective Spot Bids by written tenders. The representative of the Authority shall, if requested by responsive contractors, furnish invitations for bids and supporting specifications to the contractors.
          
          
            Sec. 5
            Procedure for negotiated price awards.
            (a) In the award of vessel repair work upon the basis of negotiation or request for quotation, other than work covered by a supplemental job order, the contractor shall be furnished with the information provided for in Article 1(a) of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract.
            (b) The contractor, within the time specified in a request for a quotation, may quote a price and shall submit itemized prices and the price breakdown provided for in Article 1(c) of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract. In the event a mutually satisfactory price cannot be agreed to, a price shall be determined by the representative of the Authority making the award which shall be set out in the job order or the supplemental job order issued to the contractor. Within thirty (30) days from the receipt of such job order or supplemental job order the contractor may appeal such price to the Director of the Authority as a dispute under Article 27 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract.
          
          
            Sec. 6
            Awarding of work.

            (a) Those portions of all bids reflecting the total aggregate cost of the work involved shall be opened publicly. The work shall be awarded to the contractor submitting the lowest qualified bid. The term lowest shall mean the bid most advantageous to the Government after evaluation of all bids by the application of differentials and any other relevant factors set forth in the Invitation for Bids. All pertinent costs of moving the vessel from the port where said vessel is located at the time bids are invited to the port of the responsive bidders' work sites and/or plants are to be stated on the Invitation for Bids. If the vessel is scheduled to return to the same port where located at the time bids were invited, all costs of returning the vessel to that port shall also be included on the Invitation for Bids and considered in the bid evaluation.
            (b) Immediately after an award of a job order or a supplemental job order on a negotiated basis a written report shall be submitted by the representative of the Authority, making the award, to the appropriate Coast Director's office stating the pertinent reasons for awarding the job on a negotiated rather than bid basis. A copy of this report must be attached to the Ship Repair Summary.
            (c) When an award is made, a job order in the form attached to the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract shall be issued to the contractor and when awards are made in excess of the Coast Directors' Authority one copy each of all job orders and supplemental job orders and supporting specifications are to be forwarded to the Chief, Division of Ship Repair and Maintenance, Washington, DC, simultaneously with the issuance of said orders to the contractors.
          
          
            Sec. 7
            Job order numbering.

            (a) The NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract number shall be inserted in every job order and supplemental job order thereto awarded to a Contractor. The Chiefs of local Ship Repair and Maintenance offices shall give consecutive numbers starting with No. 1 to job orders awarded by them to each contractor. The General Agents shall give consecutive numbers starting with No. 1 to job orders awarded by each General Agent. Job orders and supplemental job orders covering work awarded by a General Agent shall bear the initials of the prime General Agent, as a prefix to the numeral for example, “Job Order No. USL-1.” Thus, the first award made by a local Ship Repair and Maintenance office to each respective master repair contractor shall bear “Job Order No. 1”. The first award made by each General Agent to each respective master repair contractor shall also bear “Job Order No. 1” and in addition the Prime General Agents initials. Sub-agents shall use the initials of the Prime General Agent in identifying the job order number. Any additional means of numbering other than the numeral and Prime Agent's initials are not to be used. Supplemental job orders shall contain the original job order number suffixed by the letter “A” on the first supplemental job order, the letter “B” on the second supplemental job order, and so forth.
          
          
            Sec. 8
            Extra work and changes.
            (a) At any time after the award of an original job order and during the time the work thereunder is being performed, additional or extra work or changes in the work covered by the job order may be directed by the representative of the Authority.
            (b) Such additional or changed work shall be directed by a written Change Order as provided in Article 6 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract.
            (c) A supplemental job order shall be issued to the Contractor covering such Change Order(s), which supplemental order shall include the agreed amount of contract price increase or decrease and any revision in the completion date of the job order work, as modified by the Change Order(s).
            (d) In the event a change in the contract price or revision in the completion date cannot be agreed upon the representative of the Authority shall determine the contract price or revised completion date and issue a supplemental job order to the contractor who shall proceed with the work covered by the Change Order(s) and the Contractor may appeal such contract price or revised completion date as provided in Article 27 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract.
          
          
            Sec. 9

            (iii) Review each repair contractor's invoice and attachments to ascertain completeness of supports and whether repair items included therein have been placed under the appropriate repair group numbers as set out in section 18 and make corrections as necessary.
            (iv) Forward the invoices and supports to the District Ship Repair and Maintenance office for final review.
            (3) The District office shall make a final review and if in order forward the contractor's invoices and other supports relating to (i) voyage and idle status repairs to the principal office of the General Agent, and (ii) reactivation repairs and all others which do not involve General Agency operated ships to the appropriate District Finance Officer.
            (4) The General Agent, upon receiving repair contractors' invoices and attachments thereto from the District Ship Repair and Maintenance office will:

            (i) Review each invoice and attachments to assure that the payment authorized by the District office appears to be proper on the basis of the attachments.

            Sec. 10
            Bonds.
            (a) All bids in response to an Invitation for Bids and all quotations in response to a request for a quotation in excess of $2,000, shall be accompanied by a guaranty or a bid bond in a sum equal to twenty-five (25) percent of such bid or quotation to insure the acceptance of the job order covering the awarded work and the furnishing of the performance and payment bonds required by Article 14 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract. The stand- ard Government form of bid bond (Standard Form 24 Revised November 1950) shall be used.
            (b) In compliance with the perform- ance bond and payment bond requirements of Article 14 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract, the standard form of individual performance bond (Standard Form 25 Revised November 1950) and the standard form of individual payment bond (Standard Form 25A Revised November 1950) respectively, shall be used. Such bonds (in the respective penal sums of 50 percent of the respective job order contract prices but if the job order contract price is in excess of $1,000,000 in the penal sum of 40 percent of such job order contract price) shall guarantee the Contractor's performance and payment obligations in connection with the work covered by an original job order awarded on either competitive bid or negotiated basis, as that work may be modified by supplemental job orders to such original job orders.
            (c) The individual bid, performance and payment bonds shall be submitted by the contractors to the awarding offices (General Agents or local offices of NSA) to verify the correctness of the penalty amount, contract and job order numbers, etc. The individual bonds shall then be forwarded by the awarding office to the office of the appropriate Coast Director for final action and approval pursuant to existing regulations.
            (d) For the convenience of contractors, in lieu of submitting individual bid, performance and payment bonds they may file with the Authority approved annual or blanket bid, performance and payment bonds covering the Contractor's bond obligations under job orders (as such job orders may be modified by supplemental job orders) awarded under said contracts in such annual period. Annual bonds shall be submitted by the Contractors or their surety representative to the appropriate Coast Director's office for clearance pursuant to existing regulations. In this regard all annual bonds must be of the open penalty type.
            (e) No repair voucher (progress or final) where bond coverage is required shall be passed for payment until such time as the required bid, performance and payment bonds have been given final clearance.
          
          
            Sec. 11
            Guarantee obligations.
            (a) Under the provisions of Article 10 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract the Contractor's guarantee liability extends to defects and deficiencies in the Contractor's work developing within sixty (60) days from the date of the acceptance of all the work and the accepted redelivery of the vessel to the Authority.

            (b) Notice of such defects and deficiencies must be given to the Contractor not later than ninety (90) days after the acceptance of the work.
            
            (c) As soon as practicable, after the acceptance of work performed under a job order, and the supplemental job orders thereto, the office awarding the job order shall furnish to the General Agent two copies of the specifications, job order and supplemental job orders, together with a statement of the date of the expiration of the Contractor's guarantee responsibility with respect to some work.
            (d) The General Agent shall during the period of the Contractor's guarantee responsibility screen all deficiencies and defects and repair items and list separately against the respective specifications, all items which represent defects or deficiencies in the Contractor's work.
            (e) In order that the Contractor may be notified of such defects and deficiencies prior to the expiration of the 90-day notice period, the General Agent, particularly with respect to vessels in foreign ports or vessels which may be at sea, shall instruct the Master of the respective vessel to forward the information with respect to defects and deficiencies in the Contractor's work to the General Agent's home office by the most expeditious manner of communication.
            (f) In connection with all deficiencies and defects, referred to in paragraph (d) of this section, the General Agent shall immediately notify the Contractor and the local Ship Repair and Maintenance Office Head in the vessel's port of call with copies of such notification to the Chief, Division of Ship Repair and Maintenance in Washington, DC, in all cases and to the Chairman, Trial and Guarantee Survey Boards, if the total contract price is equal to or in excess of $100,000. If practicable, the local Ship Repair and Maintenance Office Head shall arrange to view the defective or deficient work in question and, if possible, shall secure the correction of such defects or deficiencies by the Contractor in question.
            (g) The General Agent, and the representative of the local Ship Repair and Maintenance staff, who acted under the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section promptly shall file with the Chief, Division of Ship Repair and Maintenance in Washington, DC, and also with the Chairman, Trial and Guarantee Survey Boards, if the total contract price equals or exceeds $100,000, separate or concurring reports setting out the defects and deficiencies, describing the actual conditions found, causes of failure, and the disposition of each defect or deficiency item.
          
          
            Sec. 12
            Disposition of removed equipment and scrap.
            (a) Article 8 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract provides that any ship equipment, fuel, lube oil, supplies, stores, furniture, fixtures, salvage and other movable property removed from the vessel is the property of the United States and shall be disposed of in such manner as the Authority may direct within sixty (60) days from the date of the completion of the work. The representative of the Authority, by appropriate item in the specifications, shall cause the Contractor to segregate all equipment, salvageable material and scrap, removed from a vessel in the performance of repairs, in such a manner as to be readily identifiable, and shall submit a list thereof to the local Property and Supply office which is responsible for arranging for retention, disposal, etc., of said equipment, material, and scrap. A copy of the listing is to be attached as a support to the Ship Repair Summary (MA-159).
            (b) After the 60-day period, if no direction for disposal is given the Contractor, the Contractor shall store and protect, in the shipyard or outside of the shipyard at its election, such property of the United States, for the additional period directed by said local Property and Supply office who shall furnish a copy of such written direction to the representative of the Authority. The increased contract price for the cost of the storage for such additional period shall be covered by purchase order prepared by the local Property and Supply office.

            (c) All scrap removed from the vessel shall be the property of the United States and shall be handled as provided in paragraph (b) of this section: Provided, however, That any scrap or salvage may, upon the written approval of the local Property and Supply office, be purchased or disposed of by the Contractor at the prevailing market price, or at not less than the fair value thereof in the absence of an established market therefor. The net sales price of the scrap or salvage disposed of by the Contractor shall be promptly paid to the office of the District Finance Officer, or at the option of the office of the District Finance Officer, shall be credited against the moneys due or to become due the Contractors.

            Sec. 13
            Insurance.
            Article 9 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract sets forth the Contractor's liabilities and obligations with respect to awarded work. Said Article 9 requires that the Contractor shall maintain insurance to cover such liabilities and obligations. Evidence of such insurance shall be submitted to the Chief, Division of Insurance, Washington, DC, by the contractors for approval.
          
          
            Sec. 14
            Anti-Kickback and Davis-Bacon Acts.
            (a) All work awarded under the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract is subject to the provisions of the Anti-Kickback Act, and is also subject to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act (except in those cases where the Invitations for Bids or job order state that the work covered thereby is not subject to the Davis-Bacon Act). Article 24 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract requires the compliance of Contractor and its subcontractors with the applicable provisions of said acts. In this respect the Contractor agrees in the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract to comply with the regulations of the Secretary of Labor made pursuant to the Anti-Kickback Act.
            (b) The Contractor shall, as provided in Article 24(a) of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract, post at the site of the work the wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor as provided in said Article 24(a).
            (c) It shall be the responsibility of the representative of the Authority awarding the work to determine that the Contractor has made the postings required by Article 24(a) of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract.
            (d) In lieu of submitting weekly certified copies of all payrolls to the Authority, as provided in Article 24(d) of the Master LUMPSUMREP Contract the Contractor shall maintain his weekly payrolls for a period of three years and submit weekly an affidavit that the payrolls of the Contractor for the preceding week are correct and complete, that the wage rates contained therein are not less than those determined by the Secretary of Labor and that the classifications set forth for each labor mechanic conforms with the work he performed. The Contractor shall also submit, and shall be responsible for the submission by its subcontractors of the Anti-Kickback Act affidavits as provided in Article 24(f) of the Master LUMPSUMREP Contract. The Contractor shall submit one copy of each of the weekly payroll and Anti-Kickback Act affidavits to the Records Administration Section, Maritime Administration, Washington 25, DC.
            (e) The representative of the Authority shall require Contractors, pursuant to the provisions of Article 24(d) of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract, to classify or reclassify any class of laborers or mechanics employed on National Shipping Authority contract work and not listed in the Secretary of Labor's decision (schedule of wages). A report of such cases shall be forwarded to the District Ship Repair and Maintenance office for transmittal to the Office of Maritime Labor Policy.
            (f) The representatives of the Authority shall be responsible for establishing procedures insuring that Contractors are complying with the Davis-Bacon Act and in cases of non-compliance withhold payment of contractors' invoices.

            (g) The following certification shall be inserted by all contractors on all invoices rendered covering work awarded under the Master Repair Contract subject to the Anti-Kickback and Davis-Bacon Acts.
            
            

              I hereby certify that in performing the work for which the invoice was rendered that all applicable terms and conditions of the Anti-Kickback and Davis-Bacon Acts as provided in the Master Repair Contract and regulations of the Department of Labor have been complied with.
            
          
          
            Sec. 15
            Subcontracts.
            Under Article 29 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract, the Contractor is authorized to subcontract portions of the work. However, the Contractor must obtain prior approval from the representative of the Authority, awarding the work, for each subcontract in an amount exceeding 10 percent of the contract price for the work covered by a job order or supplemental job order.
          
          
            Sec. 16
            Liquidated damages.
            (a) The liquidated damages payable for each calendar day of delay shall be placed on each job order and supplemental job order whether awarded on a competitive bid or negotiated basis.
            (b) The completion certificates are to contain the date on which work is actually completed, whereas the job order and supplemental job orders are to contain a completion date based on a fair and reasonable estimate of time to be allowed the contractor to perform the work. Thus, the difference between the completion date specified on the job order or supplemental job orders and on the completion certificates will be the period for which liquidated damages are assessed. If an extension of an original completion date is considered justifiable, the completion certificates are to bear in detail in the space provided for “exceptions” the reasons why the completion dates were extended beyond that specified in the original job orders. The face of the Ship Repair Summaries (MA-159) shall reflect the amounts of liquidated damages. The penalty amount shall be deducted from the invoice prior to payment for the work involved.

            Performance of work resulting from damage sustained while undergoing repairs.

            (a) When damage is sustained by a vessel during performance of repairs under the NSA Master Contract, negotiations for accomplishment of work necessary to correct such damage are to be made with the repair contractor involved, if practicable, and a job order issued to the contractor for the repair of damage. Such job orders are to be assigned a new number and are not to be supplemental to the original award. The following “without prejudice” clause is to be made a part of and place on each job order issued for the performance of work discussed in this section.
            
            
              It is understood and agreed that the work covered by this job order is awarded and accepted without prejudice to, or waiver of, any rights of the United States or the Contractor.
            
            
            (b) If it is determined that the contractor is at fault and the contractor refuses to accept the responsibility, the procedure outlined in Article 27 of the master repair contract shall be followed. It is to be understood that the payment of this type of account is to be withheld pending establishment that the contractor involved is relieved of all responsibility for the damage.
            (c) In the event other than the original contractor effects the damage repairs immediate arrangements are to be made by and through the General Agent to collect from the contractor considered responsible for the damages.
            (d) A damage survey is to be conducted in all such cases and a report thereon submitted to the Chief, Division of Ship Repair and Maintenance, Washington, DC.

            Scope.

            This part establishes procedures for assigning priority for use by defense agencies, on commercial terms, of commercial shipping services, containers and chassis, and port facilities and services and for allocating vessels employed in commercial shipping services, containers and chassis, and port facilities and services for exclusive use by defense agencies (as defined in 340.2), at any time where appropriate under provision of title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. App. 2061 et seq.) as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. The procedures will provide the means to require vessel and port operators to provide defense agencies with existing commercial services and facilities not obtainable through established transportation procurement procedures. Thus the procedures will minimize interference with commercial operations and ensure rapid response to defense needs in times of crisis or war.

            § 340.3
            General provisions.

            (a) The provisions of this rule apply pursuant to authority granted to the President by title I, Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2061 et seq.) that authority having been delegated to the Secretary of Transportation, with respect to civil transportation services, by § 322.3(b) of title 44, Code of Federal Regulations. In order to give priority to performance under contracts deemed necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense and to allocate materials and facilities in such manner, upon such conditions and to such extent as necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense, the following procedures shall be applicable:
            (1) In connection with deployment of the Armed Forces of the United States, or other requirements of the nation's defense, a defense agency (as defined in § 340.2(h) of this part) may request priority use or allocation of vessels employed in commercial shipping services, containers, chassis, or port facilities and services.
            (2) The Secretary may authorize initiation of priority and allocation authority in accordance with administrative and statutory authorities.
            (3) The Administrator, on approval by the Secretary to initiate the use of priority and allocation authority under this regulation and in conformance with national program priorities, may direct owners and/or operators of vessels, containers, chassis, or port facilities to give priority usage to the defense agency or may allocate vessels, containers, chassis, or facilities for the defense agency's use during specified periods.
            (b) A defense agency may transmit requests for assignment of priority for use or for allocation of vessels, containers, chassis, and port facilities and services to the Secretary by letter, memorandum, or electrical message.
            (c) Justification for requested priorities or allocations may include references to military operations plans. When classified, justifications may be provided separately by correspondence or staff coordination. NSPOs and NAOs will not include classified information.
            (d) The Administrator shall determine, before issuing an NSPO or NAO, that the action is necessary to meet the requirements of the national defense (as determined by the defense agency) and conforms to Secretarial guidance for coordinating the Department's crisis response, and that the proposed approach is the most effective way to do so. The Administrator, in conjunction with the defense agency, shall coordinate with vessel operators, container suppliers, chassis suppliers, port authorities and the Coast Guard to identify vessels, equipment and facilities to meet requirements covered by NSPOs and NAOs. The Administrator shall ensure that arrangements to provide defense support under NSPOs and NAOs satisfy the defense agency's requirements with minimum disruption to commercial activities.

            (e) When resources are required for movement of hazardous or other special cargo, the Administrator shall ensure that the Commandant of the Coast Guard and the Captain of the Port and other concerned hazardous materials officials of the U.S. Department of Transportation, as required, are notified and that the views of all concerned agencies and interests are obtained and reflected in actions taken pursuant to this regulation. Any action taken pursuant to this regulation shall conform with existing regulations for the safe transportation of hazardous materials and or cargoes, subject to Department of Transportation exemptions.
            (f) The Secretary shall notify FEMA of the intention to issue any directive granting priority for use or allocation of vessels, containers, chassis, or port facilities and services, and shall provide information copies of NSPOs and NAOs as required to the defense agency concerned, FEMA, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Coast Guard.
            (g) Defense agencies which foresee difficulty in meeting their needs for vessels employed in commercial shipping services, containers, chassis, or port facilities and services shall coordinate with MARAD, the Coast Guard, vessel operators, container suppliers, chassis suppliers, and port authorities concerned before the need arises. The Administrator, after Secretarial review, may issue planning orders for information and guidance of affected agencies confirming tentative arrangements to meet the defense agencies' needs. No action will be taken to give effect to those arrangements until NSPOs and NAOs are issued at the time the services, equipment, or facilities are required.
            (h) Defense agencies shall pay for services covered by NSPOs and NAOs on the basis of commercial tariffs, or on the basis of contracts concluded between the operator interests and the defense agencies concerned, or on the basis of existing contracts where both parties so agree.
            (i) Defense agencies shall be responsible for payment of costs arising from:
            (1) Shifting ships to unoccupied berths for defense use;
            (2) Discharging commercial cargo to free ships for defense use; and
            (3) Such other costs as may be agreed between the defense agency and the provider of service.
            (j) The provisions of this regulation shall apply to foreign vessels, containers, and chassis only when and to the extent that such vessels, containers, and chassis are available to the United States because of control by U.S. citizens (46 App. U.S.C. 802) or by provision of international agreements for use of shipping services and related resources for the common defense.
            (k) Recipients of NSPOs and NAOs shall notify the Administrator, without undue delay, when they cannot comply or are experiencing difficulty in complying with the provisions of the Orders.

            Purpose.
            This part prescribes the standard form of marine terminal contract to be entered into by the United States of America, acting by and through the Director, National Shipping Authority (NSA) of the Maritime Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, with State or municipal authorities or private terminal operators for the provision of terminal operating services during civil defense emergencies or national emergencies declared by the President of the United States in accordance with existing statutory authority or by concurrent resolution of the Congress.
          
          
            Sec. 2
            Stand-by agreements.
            The Director NSA, Maritime Administration, in advance of an emergency, may negotiate the standard form of terminal operating contract specified in Section 3, with terminal operators on a stand-by basis. Stand-by arrangements establish the framework of rapid initiation of government shipping operations at the outset of an emergency.
            At port facilities, (as defined in section 1(e) of 32A CFR part 1901) under the control of the Maritime Administration and allocated for long term exclusive use by the Department of Defense (DOD), provisions will ordinarily be made for the use of contractors under DOD contracts to move DOD cargo through selected ports, to perform such services as pre-stowing, receipt, intransit storage and loading of cargo under DOD procedures for the Defense Transportation System. When it becomes necessary to move DOD cargo through marine terminals under the control of the Maritime Administration, but not allocated for long term exclusive use by DOD, contractors will be required to perform such services as DOD requires for handling cargo and documenting shipments under the Defense Transportation System, with corresponding contractual obligations.

              (b) The operator recognizes the relation of trust and confidence established between it and the United States by this agreement, and agrees to furnish its best skill and judgment in planning, supervising and performing the work, to make every effort to complete the work in the shortest time practicable, and to cooperate fully with the United States in furthering the interests of the United States. The operator agrees to furnish efficient business administration and superintendence in performing the work.
              (c) Upon the execution of this agreement the operator shall immediately furnish to the Regional Office, NSA, written schedules of the wages and contractual working conditions, (including overtime, pay, insurance benefits and other compensation and employment benefits) payable by the operator in performing the work, and whenever requested from time to time thereafter, the operator shall furnish similar written schedules to the Regional Office, NSA, covering the then existing conditions.

              Art. 5. Liability of the operator. (a) While performing the work, the operator shall, except as provided in paragraph 6(c) of part II hereof, be responsible for any and all loss, damage or injury, including death to persons, cargo, vessels, their stores, apparel or equipment, wharves, docks, piers, lighters, elevators, cars, carfloats or other property or thing, arising through the negligence or fault of the operator, its employees or terminals: Provided, That, to the extent not covered by insurance, the operator shall not be responsible to the NSA, for any loss, damage or injury resulting from the negligence or wrongful acts of the NSA; or from acts of the operator and its employees performed only because specifically so directed by the NSA; or from defects or other gear supplied by the United States.
              (b) The operator shall be under no liability to the United States in the event that the operator should fail to perform any work hereunder by reason of any labor shortage, dispute or difficulty, or any strike or lockout or any shortage of material or any act of God or peril of the sea or any other cause beyond the control of the operator, whether or not of the same or similar nature; or shall do or fail to do any act in reliance upon instructions of military or naval authorities.
              Art. 6. Insurance requirements and indemnification. (a) The operator shall procure, and maintain during the term of this agreement, pay for one or more policies of insurance insuring it as follows, as the basis for calculating compensation payable under paragraph 5(a) above:
              (1) Coverage of all piers, wharves, buildings, structures, facilities and equipment, as owner or in accordance with terms of lease.
              (2) Standard workman's compensation insurance and employer's liability insurance, including longshoremen and harbor worker's compensation insurance, or such of these as may be proper under applicable State or Federal statutes. Such insurance shall, unless otherwise required by applicable State or Federal statutes, be subject to $50,000/100,000 limits and shall be full coverage with occupational disease endorsement. The operator may, however, be a self-insurer against the risks in this subparagraph, if it has obtained the prior approval of the Director, NSA, such approval to be given upon the submission of satisfactory evidence that the operator has duly qualified as a self-insurer under applicable provisions of law.
              (3) Public liability insurance with limits of at least $1,000,000 for the death or bodily injuries to one person and at least $5,000,000 for the death or bodily injuries to more than one person in any one accident or occurrence.
              (4) Property damage liability insurance covering damage to or loss of property resulting from the negligence of the operator with a limit of $1,000,000 for each occurrence.
              (b) All liability insurance obtained by the operator as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section above shall name the United States as additional insured or provided for a waiver or subrogation.
              (c) The operator's work is incident to war activities of the United States and will involve risks and hazards far in excess of those normally incident to peacetime commercial operations. To induce the operator to undertake the performance of the work for the compensation herein provided, and thus obtain for the United States the resulting benefit of such reduced compensation, the United States undertakes to and does indemnify the operator and hold it harmless against any loss or damage to the terminals (whether owned, leased or occupied under license) and against expense (including expense of litigation), liability to and claims of third persons because of loss, damage or injury to persons, cargo, vessels, their stores, apparel or equipment, wharves, piers, docks, lighters, barges, scows, elevators, rail cars, carfloats, or other property or thing, arising through the negligence or fault of the operator, its employees, gear or equipment, or otherwise, all subject, however, to the following conditions and limitations:
              (1) The undertaking of the United States shall be applicable only and limited to:
              (a) For public liability the amount such loss, expense, or liability arising from any single catastrophe, accident or occurrence exceeds the sum of $1,000,000 each person and $5,000,000 per accident or the sum of insurance approved or required to be carried in excess of these limits, whichever sum is greater and
              (b) For property damage liability the amount such loss, expense or liability arising from any single catastrophe, accident or occurrence exceeds the sum of $1,000,000 per accident or the sum of insurance approved or required to be carried in excess of these limits whichever sum is greater.
              (2) The undertaking of the United States shall not be applicable and the United States shall have no obligation or liability in respect of such undertaking or otherwise, in situations in which such loss, expense or liability is due in whole or in part to willful and deliberate disregard of instructions of the Administrator or the personal failure to exercise good faith or insofar as the character of the work permits under wartime operations that degree of care normally exercised under like conditions in the performance of the operator's peacetime commercial operations, by the elected corporate officers of the operator or by the representative of the operator having supervision and direction of all operations at any terminal where the operator may perform services hereunder.

              (3) As soon as practicable after occurrence of any event from which the obligation of the United States to hold the operator harmless against loss, expense and liability might arise, written notice of such event shall be given by the operator to the United States, which notice shall contain full particulars of the event. If claim is made or suit is brought thereafter against the operator as a result or because of such event, the operator shall immediately deliver to the United States every demand, notice, summons or other process received by it or its representatives, and the United States shall provide appropriate attachment or appeal bonds or undertakings where required in the course of such litigation.
              (4) The operator shall cooperate with the United States and, upon the request of the United States, shall assist in effecting settlements, securing and giving evidence, obtaining the attendance of witnesses and in the conduct (including defense) of suits; and the United States shall reimburse the operator for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, other than loss of earnings, incurred in so doing. The operator shall not voluntarily, except at its own cost, make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense, other than for such immediate medical and surgical relief to others as shall be imperative at the time of said occurrence of such event.

              (5) This undertaking of the United States to hold the operator harmless against loss, expense and liability as herein provided, shall not create or give rise to any right, privilege or power in any person or organization, except the operator, nor shall any person or organization be or become entitled to join the United States as a co-defendent in any action against the operator brought to determine the operator's liability or for any other purpose; Provided, however, That as to any risk borne or assumed by the United States through the undertaking set above, the United States shall be and hereby is subrogated by the operator to any claim, demand or cause of action against third persons or organizations which exists or may arise in favor of the operator, and the operator shall, if so required, forthwith execute a formal assignment or transfer of such claim, demand or cause of action.
              (6) This undertaking of the United States shall not apply against any loss or expense resulting from enemy attack upon the United States.
              Art. 7. Covenant against assignment or sublease of terminals. The operator shall not assign or sublet the terminals or any portion thereof nor grant any license with respect thereto, except in the ordinary course of terminal operations and subject to the approval of the NSA.
              Art. 8. Custom of the port. No rule or custom of the port in conflict with any provision or term of this agreement will be binding upon the United States, unless the operator is legally obligated to comply with the same pursuant to the laws of the United States or laws of any State thereof or pursuant to the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of any lease covering the terminals and entered into between the operator and its lessor or licensor thereof.
              Art. 9. Extra work. The United States will neither compensate nor make any payments to the operator for any extra work in connection with the operation of terminals which it may render in addition to the work specifically required by this agreement, except as provided in paragraph 3(e) of part II hereof.
              Art. 10. Status of employees. All employees of the operator or of any other person or organization employed in performance of the work shall at all times be the employees of the operator or of such other person or organization, as the case may be, and are not employees of the United States.
              Art. 11. Delegation of authority. Wherever and whenever any right, power or authority herein is granted or given to the United States, such right, power or authority may be exercised by the NSA or such agent or agents as the United States may appoint, and the act or acts of such agent or agents when taken shall constitute the act of the United States hereunder. In performing the work, the operator may rely upon the instructions and directions of the Director, NSA, his officers and responsible employees, or any person or agency authorized by him. Whenever practicable, instructions and directions to the operator shall be in writing and oral instructions or directions given shall be confirmed promptly in writing. No Director's orders or regulations shall have retroactive effect without the written consent of the General Counsel, Maritime Administration.
              Art. 12. Warranty against contingent fees. The operator warrants that it has not employed any person to solicit or secure this agreement upon any agreement for a commission, percentage, brokerage or contingent fee. Breach of this warranty shall give the United States the right to annul this agreement or in its discretion to deduct from any amount payable hereunder the amount of such commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee.
              Art. 13. Equal opportunity. During the performance of this agreement, the operator agrees as follows:
              (a) The operator will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin. The contractor will take affirmative action to insure that all action related to employment is taken without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to, employment, promotion, layoff or termination, direct or indirect compensation and selection for training, except where such provisions are governed by State civil service commissions or comparable government agencies. The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants, notices to be provided by the NSA setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.

              (b) The operator will, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the operator, state that all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, or national origin.
              (c) The operator will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which it has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice, to be provided by the NSA, advising the labor union or worker's representative of the operator's commitments under section 202 of Executive Order No. 11246 of September 24, 1965, as amended, and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment.
              (d) The operator will comply with all provisions of Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, and by the rules, regulations and orders of the Secretary of Labor.
              (e) The operator will furnish all information and reports required by Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, and by the rules, regulations and orders of the Secretary of Labor, or pursuant thereto, and will permit access to its books, records, and accounts by the NSA and the Secretary of Labor for purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations and orders.
              (f) In the event of the operator's noncompliance with the nondiscrimination clauses of this agreement or with any of such rules, regulations or orders, this agreement may be cancelled, terminated or suspended in whole or in part, and the operator may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, and such other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, or by rule, regulation or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as otherwise provided by law.

              (g) The operator will include the provisions of this paragraph in every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by rules, regulations or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 204 of Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The operator will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as the NSA may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions, including sanctions for noncompliance: Provided, however, That in the event the operator becomes involved in or is threatened with litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of such direction by the NSA, the operator may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.
              Art. 14. Officials not to benefit. No persons elected or appointed as members of or delegates to Congress, themselves or by any other persons in trust for them, or for their use or account shall hold or enjoy this agreement in whole or in part, except as provided in Section 433, Title 18, United States Code. The operator shall not employ any member of Congress, either with or without compensation, as an attorney, agent, officer or director.
              Art. 15. Right of Controller General to examine books and records. The Controller General of the United States or any of his duly authorized representatives shall have access to and the right to examine any pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the operator or any of its subcontractors engaged in the performance of the work under this agreement.
              Art. 16. Renegotiation. This agreement shall be deemed to contain all the provisions required by section 104 of the Renegotiation Act of 1951. The operator shall, in compliance with said section 104, insert the provisions of this paragraph in each subcontract and purchase order made or issued in carrying out this agreement.

            § 349.1
            Purpose.

            This part prescribes regulations implementing section 302, Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (Act), as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1132), added by section 10 of Pub. L. 104-239, the Maritime Security Act of 1996. These regulations provide the procedures by which the Maritime Administration (MARAD), under authority delegated by the Secretary of Transportation to the Maritime Administrator, certifies, upon application, that certain merchant seamen are entitled to reemployment rights and other benefits after completion of their service on vessels used by the United States for a war, armed conflict, national emergency or maritime mobilization need. It also describes the form of administrative assistance MARAD will provide to the seamen certified.
          
          
            § 349.2
            Application for certification.
            Pursuant to 46 App. U.S.C. 1132, an individual may submit an application to MARAD not later than 45 days after the date the individual completes the period of employment described in § 349.3 of this part.
          
          
            § 349.3
            Certification criteria.
            The Administrator shall apply the following criteria for certifying that an individual merchant seaman is entitled to reemployment rights and other benefits substantially equivalent to the rights and benefits provided by chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, for any member of a Reserve Component of the Armed Forces of the United States who is ordered to active duty. It shall be the responsibility of each applicant for certification to submit relevant documentation to MARAD, Office of Maritime Labor, Training, and Safety, MAR-250, 400 Seventh St., S.W., Room 7302, Washington, D.C. 20590, establishing that—
            (a) Employment as merchant seaman. The applicant was employed after October 8, 1996, in the activation or operation of a vessel—
            (1) in the National Defense Reserve Fleet maintained by MARAD under authority of section 11 of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 (50 U.S.C. App. 1744) in a period in which that vessel was in use or being activated for use under 50 U.S.C. App. 1744(b);
            (2) that is requisitioned under section 902 of the Act (46 App. U.S.C. 1242); or
            (3) that is owned, chartered, or controlled by the United States and used by the United States for a war, armed conflict, national emergency, or maritime mobilization need (including for training purposes or testing for readiness and suitability for mission performance).
            (b) Seaman credentials. During the period of employment described in paragraph (a) of this section, the seaman possessed a valid license, certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's document issued under chapter 73 (as applicable) of title 46, United States Code, as required by 46 App. U.S.C. 1132(c).
            (c) Additional information. If applicable, periods of hospitalization, convalescence, illness, injury, shipwreck or detention beyond the mariner's control were incurred in, or aggravated during, the performance of employment described in § 349.3(a).
          
          
            § 349.4
            Decision on application.
            MARAD will issue or deny certification (accompanied by an explanation in writing) to each applicant not later than 20 days after receipt of an application for certification.
          
          
            § 349.5
            Reemployment rights and benefits.
            (a) General. An individual who is absent from a position of employment, in the private or public (federal, state or local government) sector, because of temporary employment of any duration described in § 349.3(a), shall be entitled to reemployment rights and benefits upon completion of the temporary employment as a merchant seaman.
            (b) Superior claims. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 4312(g), the right of a person to reemployment shall not entitle such person to retention preference or displacement rights over any person with a superior claim under the provisions of title 5, United States Code, relating to veterans and other preference eligibles.
            (c) Notification of employer. Any person who is absent from a position of employment by reason of service as described in § 349.3(a) shall be entitled to reemployment rights and benefits provided in § 349.3(e) if—

            (1) The person has given advance written or verbal notice of such service to such person's employer, unless giving notice is precluded by military necessity, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, or, under all relevant circumstances, is impossible or unreasonable, pursuant to the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 4312(b); and
            (2) The person submits an application for reemployment with the employer not later than 14 days after completion of a period of service of less than 181 days, or not later than 90 days after the completion of a period of service greater than 180 days, or if submitting such application within such period is impossible or unreasonable through no fault of the person, the next first full calendar day when submission of such application becomes possible.
            (d) Waiver of notice requirements. A person who has not given notice, or who fails to report or apply for employment or re-employment within the appropriate period specified in paragraph (c) of this section shall not automatically forfeit such person's entitlement to the rights and benefits referred to in § 349.5(e), but shall be subject to the rules of conduct, established by policy, and the general practices of the employer pertaining to explanations and discipline with respect to absence from scheduled work. MARAD will make a determination on the issue of whether notice of service was required in acting on the application for certification.
            (e) Exception to reemployment rights. An employer is not required to reemploy an individual if the employer satisfies the burden of proving that, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 4312(d)—
            (1) The employer's circumstances have so changed as to make such reemployment impossible or unreasonable, or such reemployment, if required, would impose an undue hardship on the employer, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4303(15); or
            (2) The employment which the individual left for employment as a merchant seaman was for a brief, nonrecurrent period and there was not at the time of leaving such employment any reasonable expectation that such employment would continue indefinitely or for a significant period.
            (f) Reemployment benefits. An individual certified by MARAD to be entitled to reemployment shall also be entitled to other “benefits of employment” (other than wages or salary for work performed), as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4303(2), that would have accrued to that individual by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy, plan or practice and includes rights and benefits under a pension plan, a health plan, an employee stock ownership plan, insurance coverage and awards, bonuses, severance pay, supplemental unemployment and benefits, vacations and the opportunity to select work hours or location of employment.
            (g) Reemployment position. (1) An individual certified by MARAD as being entitled to reemployment shall be promptly reemployed by the former employer, according to the order of priority specified in 38 U.S.C. 4313(a), after submitting an application for reemployment. The three categories of priority, in ascending order, are for a merchant seaman who:
            (i) Served for 90 days or less;

                Penalty for False Statement: A fine or imprisonment, or both, are provided for violation of the proscriptions contained in 18 U.S.C. 1001 (see also 18 U.S.C. 286, 287).
            
            (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2133-0012)
            [G.O. 89, Rev., 35 FR 11558, July 18, 1970, as amended at 35 FR 11686, July 22, 1970; 47 FR 25530, June 14, 1982; 69 FR 34311, June 21, 2004]
          
          
            § 355.3
            Criteria to be applied in support of stock data in affidavit.
            (a) The same criteria should be observed in obtaining information to be furnished for stockholders named (direct ownership of required percentage of shares of stock of each class or series) in the Affidavit as those observed for the primary corporation. If, on the other hand, the “fair inference rule” is applied with respect to stock ownership (see Collier Advertising Service, Inc. v. Hudson River Day Line, 14 Fed. Supp. 335), the extent of U.S. citizen ownership of stock should be ascertained in the requisite percentage (65 percent for foreign operation and 95 percent for coastwise operation) in order that the veracity of the statutory statements made in the Affidavit (paragraph 5) may be relied upon by the Maritime Administration.
            (b) When applying the fair inference rule (where there are more than 30 stockholders, except where one or more of such number actually owns the controlling or 75 percent interest) in order to prove U.S. citizen ownership in the required percentages (1) for foreign operation, 65 percent of the shares of stock of each class or series must be shown to be held by persons with registered addresses within the United States to prove that 51 percent or controlling interest is vested in citizens of the United States and (2) for coastwise operation, 95 percent of the shares of stock of each class or series must be shown to be held by persons having registered addresses within the United States to prove that 75 percent of the interest in the corporation is vested in citizens of the United States.
            (c) If the primary corporation is consecutively owned by several “parent” corporations (holders of 100 percent of the stock of each or all classes or series of stock issued and outstanding), the facts should be given in proper sequence either by chart or in narrative form, revealing the facts of stock ownership. The information with respect to the ultimate parent should include data relative to the basis upon which controlling or 75 percent (depending upon whether the primary corporation operates in the domestic or foreign commerce) is established, together with the names of the owners of record or beneficial owners of 5 percent or more of each class or series of stock, if more than one class or series, and statement that such owners are citizens of the United States. In any case where different classes or series of stock exist, each class or series shall be treated depending upon whether “closely held” or “publicly held,” individually in applying the fair inference rule, if applicable, or giving the relevant information with respect to United States citizens owning of record 51 percent or 75 percent of the interest.
          
          
            § 355.4
            Changes in citizenship data.
            It shall be incumbent upon the parties filing affidavits under this part to apprise the Maritime Administration promptly in writing relative to changes in data last furnished with respect to officers, directors, and stockholders holding 5 percent or more of the issued and outstanding stock of each class or series, together with statements concerning the citizenship status thereof.
          
          
            § 355.5
            Additional material.

            If additional material is determined to be essential to clarify or support the evidence of U.S. citizenship, such material shall be furnished by the aforementioned primary corporation upon request by the Maritime Administration.

              § 356.1
              Purpose.
              (a) Part 356 implements the U.S. Citizenship requirements of the American Fisheries Act of 1998, as amended, Title II, Division C, Public Law 105-277, for owners, Mortgage Trustees, and Mortgagees of vessels of 100 feet or greater in registered length that have a fishery endorsement to the vessel's documentation or where a fishery endorsement to the vessel's documentation is being sought. This part also addresses ancillary matters of charters, management agreements, exclusive sales or marketing contracts, conflicts with international agreements, determinations regarding violations of harvesting or processing limits, and exceptions for certain vessels, vessel owners and Mortgagees from the general requirements of the rule.

              (b) An agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Part 356 establishes a new requirement for the collection of information. The Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) has reviewed and approved the information collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.) and assigned OMB control number 2133-0530 to the information collection requirements of this part 356.

              Waivers.
              In special circumstances and for good cause shown, we may waive the procedures prescribed in this part, provided the waiver is consistent with the requirements of the AFA and with the intent of this part.

              (f) The same criteria should be observed in obtaining information to be furnished for stockholders named (direct ownership of required percentage of shares of stock of each class) in the Affidavit as those observed for the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel. If, on the other hand, the “fair inference rule” is applied with respect to stock ownership as outlined in § 356.7(c), the extent of U.S. Citizen ownership of stock should be ascertained in the requisite percentage (65 % for state or federally chartered financial institutions and 95 % for Fishing Industry Vessel owners, bareboat charterers, trustees, as well as entities owning 5% or more of the stock of such entities). Any entity that must establish its U.S. citizenship has to submit proof of U.S. citizenship of any five percent stockholder of each class of stock in order that the veracity of the statutory statements made in the Affidavit (paragraph 5) may be relied upon by MARAD.
              (g) It shall be incumbent upon the parties filing affidavits under this part to notify the Citizenship Approval Officer in writing within 30 calendar days of any changes in information last furnished with respect to the officers, directors, and stockholders, including 5 percent or more stockholders of the issued and outstanding stock of each class, together with information concerning their citizenship status. If other than a corporation, comparable information must be filed by other entities owning Fishing Industry Vessel, including any entity whose ownership interest is being relied upon to establish 75% ownership by Citizens of the United States.
              (h) If additional material is determined to be essential to clarify or support the evidence of U.S. citizenship, such material shall be furnished by the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel upon request by the Citizenship Approval Officer.

              § 356.7
              Methods of establishing ownership by United States Citizens.
              (a) An entity may demonstrate that the interest in the entity (75% for Citizens of the United States or 51% for entities meeting the Controlling Interest requirements) is owned by Citizens of the United States either by direct proof or through the fair inference method depending on the size of the entity.
              (b) The “direct proof” method is used for closely held companies that have 30 or fewer stockholders. Under the direct proof method, the following information must be set forth in paragraph four of the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship:

              (1) The identity of the holders of stock or other equitable interests;
              
              (2) The amount of stock or interest that each stockholder owns;
              (3) A representation as to the citizenship of the stockholder; and
              (4) If the stockholder is a corporation or other entity, the names and citizenship of officers, directors, stockholders, etc. must be set out in the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship.
              (c) The “fair inference method” is used by corporations whose stock is publicly traded (more than 30 stockholders). Use of the fair inference method requires that:
              (1)(i) At least 95% of the stock (each class) of the corporation be held by Persons having a registered U.S. address in order to infer at least 75% ownership by U.S. Citizens, or
              (ii) At least 65% of the stock (each class) of the corporation be held by Persons having a registered U.S. address in order to infer at least 51% ownership by U.S. Citizens; and
              (2) Disclosure be made in the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship of the names and citizenship of any stockholders who holds five percent or more of the corporation's stock (including all classes of stock, voting and non-voting), officers, and directors.
              (d) If the owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel is consecutively owned by several “parent” corporations, the facts revealing the stock ownership of each entity must be set forth in the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship.

The prohibition against Non-Citizens owning or controlling more than 25%, in the aggregate, of the interest in an entity that owns a Fishing Industry Vessel means, for example, that:
              (a) Non-Citizens that own or control a 25% stake in the ownership entity of a Fishing Industry Vessel at the first tier may not have any interest whatsoever in any entity that is being relied upon to establish the required 75% U.S. Citizen ownership; and
              (b) Non-Citizens that own or control less than a 25% stake at the first tier may participate in the ownership and control of other entities that are being relied upon to establish the required 75% U.S. Citizen ownership and control at the first tier. However, the total ownership and control by Non-Citizens of the entity owning a Fishing Industry Vessel may not exceed 25% in the aggregate as computed by MARAD.
            
            
              § 356.11
              Impermissible control by a Non-Citizen.
              (a) An impermissible transfer of control will be deemed to exist where a Non-Citizen, whether by agreement, contract, influence, or any other means whatsoever:
              (1) Has the right to direct the business of the entity which owns the Fishing Industry Vessel. The right to “direct the business of the entity” does not include the right to simply participate in the direction of the business activities of an entity which owns a Fishing Industry Vessel;
              (2) Has the right in the ordinary course of business to limit the actions of or replace the chief executive officer, a majority of the board of directors, any general partner or any person serving in a management capacity of the entity which owns the Fishing Industry Vessel. Standard rights of minority shareholders to restrict the actions of the entity are permitted provided they are unrelated to day-to-day business activities. These rights include provisions to require the consent of the minority shareholder to sell all or substantially all of the assets, to enter into a different business, to contract with the majority investors or their affiliates or to guarantee the obligations of majority investors or their affiliates;
              (3) Has the right to direct the transfer, operation, or manning of a Fishing Industry Vessel. The right to “direct the transfer, operation, or manning” of such vessels does not include the right to simply participate in the direction of the transfer, operation, and manning of such vessels;

              (4) Has the right to restrict unduly the day-to-day business activities and management policies of the entity owning a Fishing Industry Vessel through loan covenants other than those approved for use by the Citizenship Approval Officer or other means;
              (5) Has the right to derive, through a minority shareholder and in favor of a Non-Citizen, a significantly disproportionate amount of the economic benefit from the ownership and operation of the Fishing Industry Vessel;
              (6) Has the right to control the management of or to be a controlling factor in the entity owning a Fishing Industry Vessel ;
              (7) Has the right to cause the sale of a Fishing Industry Vessel other than:
              (i) By an entity that is eligible to hold a Preferred Mortgage on the vessel pursuant to § 356.19(a)(2) through (a)(5);
              (ii) By an approved Mortgage Trustee that is exercising loan and mortgage covenants on behalf of a beneficiary that qualifies as a Commercial Lender, a Lender Syndicate or an entity eligible to hold a Preferred Mortgage under § 356.19(a)(2) through (a)(5);
              (iii) By an approved Mortgage Trustee that is exercising loan or mortgage covenants for a beneficiary that is not qualified to hold a Preferred Mortgage, provided that the loan or mortgage covenants have been approved by the Citizenship Approval Officer; or
              (iv) Where it is necessary in order to allow a Non-Citizen to dissolve its interest in the entity;
              (8) Absorbs all of the costs and normal business risks associated with ownership and operation of the Fishing Industry Vessel;
              (9) Has the responsibility for the procurement of insurance on the Fishing Industry Vessel, or assumes any liability in excess of insurance coverage; or,
              (10) Has the ability through any other means whatsoever to control the entity that owns a Fishing Industry Vessel.
              (b) In addition to the actions in paragraph (a) of this section that are considered absolute indicia of control, we will consider other factors which, in combination with other elements of Non-Citizen involvement, may be deemed impermissible control. The following factors may be considered indicia of control:
              (1) If a Non-Citizen minority stockholder takes the leading role in establishing an entity that will own a Fishing Industry Vessel;
              (2) If a Non-Citizen has the right to preclude the owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel from engaging in other business activities;
              (3) If a Non-Citizen and owner use the same law firm, accounting firm, etc.;
              (4) If a Non-Citizen and owner share the same office space, phones, administrative support, etc.;
              (5) If a Non-Citizen absorbs considerable costs and normal business risks associated with ownership and operation of the Fishing Industry Vessel;
              (6) If a Non-Citizen provides the start up capital for the owner or bareboat charterer on less than an arm's-length basis;
              (7) If a Non-Citizen time charterer has the general right to inspect the books and records of the owner, bareboat charterer, or time charterer of a Fish Processing Vessel or Fish Tender Vessel;
              (8) If the owner or bareboat charterer uses the same insurance agent, law firm, accounting firm, or broker of any Non-Citizen with whom the owner or a bareboat charterer has entered into a mortgage, long-term or exclusive sales or marketing agreement, unsecured loan agreement, or management agreement; or
              (9) If a Non-Citizen has the right to control, whether through sale, lease or other method, the fishing quota, fishing rights or processing rights allocated to a vessel or vessel-owning entity.
              (c) In most cases, any single factor listed in paragraph (b) of this section will not be sufficient to deem an entity a Non-Citizen. However, a combination of several factors listed in paragraph (b) of this section may increase our concern as to whether the entity complies with the U.S. Citizen ownership and control provisions of the AFA and any single factor listed in paragraph (b) of this section may be the basis for a request from us for further information.

              (d) If we have a concern regarding a Non-Citizen, we will notify the entity of the concern and work with the entity toward a satisfactory resolution, provided there is no verifiable evidence of fraud. Resolution of any control issues may result in a request by us for additional information to clarify the intent of the provision or to amend or delete the provision in question.
              (e) Information that is specifically required to be submitted for our consideration is set out in § 356.13. However, in determining whether an entity has control over a Fishing Industry Vessel, we may review any contract or agreement that may, by any means whatsoever, result in a transfer of control to a Non-Citizen.

            Subpart C—Requirements for Vessel Owners
            
              § 356.13
              Information required to be submitted by vessel owners.
              (a) In order to be eligible to document a Fishing Industry Vessel with a fishery endorsement, the entity that owns the vessel must submit documentation to demonstrate that 75 percent (75%) of the interest in such entity is owned and controlled by Citizens of the United States. Unless otherwise exempted, the following documents must be submitted to the Citizenship Approval Officer in support of a request for a determination of U.S. Citizenship:
              (1) An Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship. This affidavit, set out in § 356.15, must contain all required facts, at all tiers of ownership, needed for determining the citizenship of the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel.
              (2) A certified copy of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel, and any parent corporation, must be submitted. The certification must be by the Secretary of State in which the corporation is incorporated or by the Secretary of the corporation. For entities other than corporations, comparable certified documents must be submitted. For example, for a limited liability company, a copy of the Certificate of Formation filed with a State must be submitted, along with a certified copy of the Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement;
              (3) An Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship for each charterer of a Fishing Industry Vessel, with the exception of time or voyage charterers of Fish Processing Vessels and Fish Tender Vessels permitted under § 356.39(b)(2);
              (4) A copy of any time charter or voyage charter to a Non-Citizen of a Fish Tender Vessel or Fish Processing Vessel;
              (5) Any loan agreements or other financing documents applicable to a Fishing Industry Vessel where the lender has not been approved by MARAD to hold a Preferred Mortgage on Fishing Industry Vessels, excepting financing documents that are exempted from review pursuant to § 356.19(d) and loan documents that have received general approval from the Citizenship Approval Officer pursuant to § 356.21 for use with an approved Mortgage Trustee.
              (6) A description of any operating and/or management agreements entered into between the owner or bareboat charterer of a Fishing Industry Vessel and an entity that has not been determined by MARAD to be a U.S. Citizen, accompanied by a representation and warranty that the agreement does not contain any provisions that convey control over the vessel or vessel-owning entity to a Non-Citizen;
              (7) Copies of any sales or purchase agreements that relate to the sale or purchase of all or a significant portion of a vessel's catch where the agreement is with an entity that has not been determined by MARAD to be a U.S. Citizen and the agreement contains provisions that could convey control to a Non-Citizen other than those expressly authorized in § 356.43. Agreements that only contain provisions expressly authorized in § 356.43 do not have to be submitted; however, the agreements and the parties to the agreements must be identified;

              (8) Any stockholder's agreement, voting trust agreements, or any other pooling agreements, including any proxy appointment, relating to the ownership of all classes of stock, whether voting or non-voting of the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel, including any parent corporation or other stockholder whose stock is being relied upon to establish 75 percent U.S. Citizen ownership;
              
              (9) Any agreements relating to an option to buy or sell stock or other comparable equity interest in the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel, or Fish Tender Vessel, or any agreement that restricts the sale of such stock or equity interests in the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel, including any parent corporation or other stockholder whose stock is being relied upon to establish 75 percent U.S. Citizen ownership;
              (10) Any documents relating to a merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel, including any parent corporation where all of the parties have not been determined by the Citizenship Approval Officer to be U.S. Citizens;
              (11) Disclosure of any interlocking directors or other officials by and between the owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel (including any parent corporation) and any Non-Citizen minority stockholder of the owner and any parent corporation. This requirement is also applicable to any lender, purchaser of fish catch, or other entity that is a Non-Citizen;
              (12) Any contract or agreement that purports to sell, lease or otherwise transfer to a Non-Citizen the fishing rights, a fishing quota, a processing quota or any other right allocated to a vessel owner, bareboat charterer, or a particular Fishing Industry Vessel; and
              (13) A copy of the Large Vessel Certification required by § 356.47.
              (b) In the event the owner or bareboat charterer of a Fishing Industry Vessel enters into any agreement reflected in any of the documents set forth in paragraph (a) of this section after the submission of the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship, the owner or bareboat charterer must notify the Citizenship Approval Officer within 30 calendar days. Failure to notify the Citizenship Approval Officer of such agreements within the prescribed time may result in the vessel owner being deemed ineligible to document the vessel with a fishery endorsement.

              § 356.15
              Filing of affidavit of U.S. Citizenship.
              (a) New owners of Fishing Industry Vessel after October 1, 2001, must file the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship and other required documentation with the Citizenship Approval Officer in order for the Citizenship Approval Officer to make a determination whether the owner is eligible to own a vessel with a fishery endorsement to the vessel's documentation. A vessel may not receive a fishery endorsement to its documentation or operate in the fisheries of the United States before this determination has been made.
              (b) If the Citizenship Approval Officer believes that there is a defect in the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship or the supporting documentation, the applicant will be notified and will be given an opportunity to work with the Citizenship Approval Officer to resolve the matter before a determination is made whether the applicant qualifies as a U.S. Citizen.

              (c) A vessel owner that has a valid fishery endorsement prior to October 1, 2001, must obtain a citizenship determination from the Citizenship Approval Officer no later than October 1, 2001, which states that the owner is a U.S. Citizen eligible to own a vessel with a fishery endorsement. If the owner obtains the required determination from the Citizenship Approval Officer, the fishery endorsement will remain valid and will be subject to renewal at the time of its next regularly scheduled annual filing to document the vessel with the Coast Guard, at which point the owner will be required to obtain an annual ruling from the MARAD's Citizenship Approval Officer that it is still a U.S. Citizen. If a vessel owner that owns a vessel with a valid fishery endorsement prior to October 1, 2001, does not obtain the required determination from the Citizenship Approval Officer by October 1, 2001, the vessel's fishery endorsement may be deemed invalid. In order to obtain a new fishery endorsement, the vessel owner will be required to obtain a citizenship determination from the Citizenship Approval Officer and to apply to the U.S. Coast Guard for a new fishery endorsement.
              
              (d) The owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel or a prospective owner of such a vessel may request a letter ruling from the Citizenship Approval Officer in order to determine whether the owner under a proposed ownership structure will qualify as a U.S. Citizen that is eligible to document the vessel with a fishery endorsement. A complete request for a letter ruling must be accompanied by an Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship and all other documentation required by “ 356.13. The Citizenship Approval Officer will issue a letter ruling based on the ownership structure that is proposed; however, the Citizenship Approval Officer reserves the right to reverse the determination if any of the elements of the ownership structure, contractual arrangements, or other material relationships are altered when the vessel owner submits the executed Affidavits and supporting documentation.

              § 356.17
              Annual requirements for vessel owners.
              (a) An owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel must submit a certification in the form of an Affidavit of United States Citizenship to the Citizenship Approval Officer on an annual basis as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The vessel owner does not have to submit duplicate copies of documents that have already been submitted and that have not changed, provided a copy is still retained by us. This annual certification requirement does not excuse the owner from the requirements of § 356.5 to notify the Citizenship Approval Officer throughout the year when changes in the citizenship information occur.
              (b) The annual certification required by paragraph (a) of this section must be filed at least 45 days prior to the renewal date for the vessel's documentation and fishery endorsement. Where multiple Fishing Industry Vessels are owned by the same entity or by entities that ultimately have common ownership, an Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship and supporting documentation may be filed for all of the vessels in conjunction with the first vessel documentation renewal during each calendar year. Any information or supporting documentation unique to a particular vessel that would normally be required to be submitted under § 356.13 or any other provision of this part 356 such as charters, management agreements, loans or financing agreements, sales, purchase or marketing agreements, or exemptions claimed under this part must be submitted with the annual filing for that vessel if the documents are not already on file with the Citizenship Approval Officer.
              (c) Failure to file the annual certification in a timely manner may result in the expiration of the vessel's fishery endorsement, which will prohibit the vessel from operating in the fisheries of the United States.

              § 356.19
              Requirements to hold a Preferred Mortgage.
              (a) In order for a Mortgagee to be eligible to obtain a Preferred Mortgage on a Fishing Industry Vessel, it must be:

              (2) A state or federally chartered financial institution that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;

              (3) A farm credit lender established under title 12, chapter 23, of the United States Code (12 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.);
              (4) A commercial fishing and agriculture bank established pursuant to State law;
              (5) A Commercial Lender organized under the laws of the United States or of a State and eligible to own a vessel under 46 U.S.C. 12102(a); or
              (6) A Mortgage Trustee that complies with the requirements of 46 U.S.C. 31322(f) and 46 CFR 356.27 through 356.37.

              (b) A Mortgagee must demonstrate to the Citizenship Approval Officer that it satisfies one of the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section before it will be qualified to obtain a Preferred Mortgage on a Fishing Industry Vessel after April 1, 2003. A Mortgagee that has an existing Preferred Mortgage on a Fishing Industry Vessel prior to April 1, 2003, will be required to demonstrate that it satisfies one of the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section before the vessel's next certificate of documentation renewal date after April 1, 2003. Failure to submit the required information may result in the loss of the preferred status for the mortgage. A sample format that may be used to submit the required information for Mortgagees, Commercial Lenders and Lender Syndicates is available on the MARAD website at http://www.marad.dot.gov/afa.html. The required information that must be submitted in order to make such a demonstration for each category in paragraph (a) is as follows:
              (1) If a Mortgagee plans to qualify as a United States Citizen under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Mortgagee must file an Affidavit of United States Citizenship demonstrating that it complies with the citizenship requirements of 46 U.S.C. 12102(c) and section 2(c) of the 1916 Act, which require that 75% of the ownership and control in the Mortgagee be vested in U.S. Citizens at each tier and in the aggregate. In addition to the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship, a certified copy of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, or other comparable corporate documents must be submitted to the Citizenship Approval Officer.
              (2) A state or federally chartered financial institution must provide a certification that indicates whether it is a state chartered or federally chartered financial institution and that certifies that it is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The certification must include the FDIC Certification Number assigned to the institution.

              (3) A farm credit lender must provide a certification indicating that it qualifies as a farm credit lender established under title 12, chapter 23, of the United States Code (12 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.);
              (4) A commercial fishing and agriculture bank must provide a certification indicating that it has been lawfully established as a commercial fishing and agriculture bank pursuant to State law and that it is in good standing;
              (5) A Commercial Lender that seeks to be qualified to hold a Preferred Mortgage directly or through a Mortgage Trustee must provide evidence that it is engaged primarily in the business of lending and other financing transactions and a certification that it has a loan portfolio in excess of $100 million, of which no more than 50 percent of the dollar amount of the loan portfolio consists of loans to borrowers in the commercial fishing industry. The certification must include information regarding the approximate size of the loan portfolio and the percentage of the portfolio that consists of loans to borrowers in the commercial fishing industry. A Commercial Lender that seeks to be qualified to hold a Preferred Mortgage directly must also submit an Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship to the Citizenship Approval Officer to demonstrate that it qualifies as one of the following:
              (i) An individual who is a citizen of the United States;
              (ii) An association, trust, joint venture, or other entity—
              (A) All of whose members are citizens of the United States; and
              (B) That is capable of holding title to a vessel under the laws of the United States or of a State;
              (iii) A partnership whose general partners are citizens of the United States, and the controlling interest in the partnership is owned by citizens of the United States;
              (iv) A corporation established under the laws of the United States or of a State, whose chief executive officer, by whatever title, and chairman of its board of directors are citizens of the United States and no more of its directors are Non-citizens than a minority of the number necessary to constitute a quorum;
              (v) The United States Government; or
              (vi) The government of a State.

              (6) A Mortgage Trustee must submit the Mortgage Trustee Application and other documents required in § 356.27. If the beneficiary under the trust arrangement has not demonstrated to the Citizenship Approval Officer that it qualifies as a Commercial Lender, a Lender Syndicate or an entity eligible to hold a preferred mortgage under paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, the Mortgage Trustee must submit to the Citizenship Approval Officer copies of the trust agreement, security agreement, loan documents, preferred mortgage, and any issuance, assignment or transfer of interest so that a determination can be made as to whether any of the arrangements results in an impermissible transfer of control of the vessel to a person not eligible to own a vessel with a fishery endorsement under 46 U.S.C. 12102(c).
              (c) A Mortgagee is required to provide the certification required by paragraph (b) of this section to the Citizenship Approval Officer on an annual basis during the time in which it holds a preferred mortgage on a Fishing Industry Vessel. The annual certification must be submitted at least 30 calendar days prior to the annual anniversary date of the original approval. The Citizenship Approval Officer will notify a Mortgagee if the Mortgagee fails to submit the required annual certification. If the Mortgagee does not provide the certification within 30 calendar days of the mailing date of the delinquency notice, the mortgage will no longer qualify as a Preferred Mortgage.
              (d) The following entities may exercise rights under loan or mortgage covenants with respect to a Fishing Industry Vessel without obtaining MARAD approval:
              (1) An entity that is deemed qualified to hold a Preferred Mortgage under paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section and that has submitted the appropriate certification to the Citizenship Approval Officer under paragraph (b) of this section; and
              (2) An approved Mortgage Trustee that is holding a Preferred Mortgage for a beneficiary that is qualified to hold a Preferred Mortgage under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section or for a beneficiary that qualifies as a Commercial Lender or a Lender Syndicate and that has made an appropriate certification to the Citizenship Approval Officer that it meets the requirements of either § 356.3(g) or § 356.3(n).
              (e) An entity that holds a Preferred Mortgage on a Fishing Industry Vessel or that is using a Mortgage Trustee to hold a Preferred Mortgage for its benefit may request a letter ruling from the Citizenship Approval Officer in order to determine whether a mortgage or mortgage trust arrangement is in compliance with the regulations in this part. The Citizenship Approval Officer reserves the right to reverse any advice given under a letter ruling if any of the elements of the proposed loan or mortgage are materially altered or if the entity requesting the letter ruling has failed to fully disclose all relevant information.

              § 356.21
              General approval of standard loan or mortgage agreements.
              (a) A lender that is engaged in the business of financing Fishing Industry Vessels and that is not a Commercial Lender or Lender Syndicate using a Mortgage Trustee to hold a Preferred Mortgage for its benefit or an entity that is otherwise qualified to hold a Preferred Mortgage on Fishing Industry Vessels pursuant to § 356.19(a)(2) through (a)(5), may apply to the Citizenship Approval Officer for general approval of its standard loan and mortgage agreements for such vessels. In order to obtain general approval for its standard loan and mortgage agreements, a lender using an approved Mortgage Trustee must submit to the Citizenship Approval Officer:
              (1) A copy of its standard loan or mortgage agreement for Fishing Industry Vessel, including all covenants that may be included in the loan or mortgage agreement; and,
              (2) A certification that it will not use covenants or restrictions in the loan or mortgage agreement outside of those approved by the Citizenship Approval Officer without obtaining the prior approval of the Citizenship Approval Officer.

              (b) A lender that receives general approval may enter into loans and mortgages on Fishing Industry Vessel without prior approval from us of each individual loan or mortgage; provided, that the loan or mortgage conforms to the standard agreement approved by the Citizenship Approval Officer and does not include any other covenants that have not been approved by the Citizenship Approval Officer.

              (c) The lender must provide an annual certification to the Citizenship Approval Officer certifying that all loans and mortgages on Fishing Industry Vessel entered into under this general approval conform to the standard agreement approved by us and do not contain deviations from the standard agreement or covenants that were not reviewed and approved by the Citizenship Approval Officer. The certification must be submitted at least 30 calendar days prior to the annual anniversary date of the previous approval.
              (d) If the lender wishes to use covenants that were not approved pursuant to this section, it must submit the new covenants to the Citizenship Approval Officer for approval.
              (e) A lender that has received general approval for its lending program and that uses covenants in a loan or mortgage on a Fishing Industry Vessel that have not been approved by the Citizenship Approval Officer will be subject to loss of its general approval and the Citizenship Approval Officer may review and approve all of the lender's mortgage and loan covenants on a case-by-case basis. The Citizenship Approval Officer may also determine that the arrangement results in an impermissible transfer of control to a Non-Citizen and therefore does not meet the requirements to qualify as a Preferred Mortgage. If the lender knowingly files a false certification with the Citizenship Approval Officer or has used covenants in a loan or mortgage on a Fishing Industry Vessel that are materially different from the approved covenants, it may also be subject to civil and criminal penalties pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001.

              § 356.31

              (a) A Mortgage Trustee that holds a Preferred Mortgage on a Fishing Industry Vessel must submit the following information to the Citizenship Approval Officer during each calendar year that it is acting as a Mortgage Trustee:
              (1) The appropriate certification and documentation required under § 356.19(b)(1) through (b)(5) to demonstrate that it is qualified to hold a Preferred Mortgage on Fishing Industry Vessels;
              (2) A copy of the most recent published report of condition of the Mortgage Trustee;

              (b) The Mortgage Trustee must file the documents required in paragraph (a) of this section within 30 calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the original approval from the Citizenship Approval Officer.

              (c) If at any time the Mortgage Trustee fails to meet the statutory requirements set forth in the AFA, the Mortgage Trustee must notify the Citizenship Approval Officer of such failure to qualify as a Mortgage Trustee not later than 20 calendar days after the event causing such failure. Upon learning that a Mortgage Trustee fails to meet the statutory or regulatory requirements to qualify as a Mortgage Trustee, we will publish a disapproval notice in the Federal Register and will notify the U.S. Coast Guard, the Mortgage Trustee, and the beneficiary of each Preferred Mortgage of such disapproval by providing them a copy of the disapproval notice. The notice to beneficiaries will be provided by standard U.S. mail to the address supplied to the Citizenship Approval Officer by the Mortgage Trustee. Within 30 calendar days of publication in the Federal Register of the disapproval notice, the disapproved Mortgage Trustee must either transfer its fiduciary responsibilities to a successor Mortgage Trustee that has been approved by the Citizenship Approval Officer or cure the defect in its approval. The preferred status of the mortgage will be maintained during the 30 day period following publication of the notice in the Federal Register and pending transfer of the Mortgage Trustee's fiduciary responsibilities to a successor Mortgage Trustee or cure of the defect.

              (3) It possesses a main propulsion engine or engines rated to produce a total of more than 3,000 shaft horsepower; such limitation shall not include auxiliary engines for hydraulic power, electrical generation, bow or stern thrusters, or similar purposes.
              (b) A vessel that meets one or more of the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section may still be eligible for a fishery endorsement if:
              (1)(i) A certificate of documentation was issued for the vessel and endorsed with a fishery endorsement that was effective on September 25, 1997; and
              (ii) The vessel is not placed under foreign registry after October 1998;
              (2) The vessel—
              (i) Is either a rebuilt vessel or replacement vessel under section 208(g) of the American Fisheries Act (title II of division C of Pub. L. 105-277; 112 Stat. 2681-627);
              (ii) Is eligible for a fishery endorsement under this section; and

              (iii) In the case of a vessel listed in paragraphs (1) through (20) of section 208(e) of the American Fisheries Act (title II of division C of Pub. L. 105-277; 112 Stat. 2681-625 et seq.) is neither participating in nor eligible to participate in the non-AFA trawl catcher processor subsector (as that term is defined under section 219(a)(7) of the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2005 (Pub. L. 108-447; 118 Stat. 2887)); or
              (3) The vessel is a fish tender vessel that is not engaged in harvesting or processing of fish.
              (c) A vessel that is prohibited from receiving a fishery endorsement under paragraph (a) of this section will be eligible if the owner of such vessel demonstrates to MARAD that:

              (1) The regional fishery management council of jurisdiction established under section 302(a)(1) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1852(a)(1)) has recommended after October 21, 1998, and the Secretary of Commerce has approved, conservation and management measures in accordance with the American Fisheries Act (Pub. L. 105-277, div. C, title II) (16 U.S.C. 1851 note) to allow the vessel to be used in fisheries under the council's authority; and

              (2) In the case of a vessel listed in paragraphs (1) through (20) of section 208(e) of the American Fisheries Act (title II of division C of Pub.

L. 108-447; 118 Stat. 2887)).
              (d) A vessel that meets one or more of the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section may still be eligible for a fishery endorsement if the vessel is engaged exclusively in the menhaden fishery in the geographic region governed by the South Atlantic Fisheries Council or the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Council.

              (e) The owner of a vessel that meets any of the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section is required to submit a certification each year in conjunction with its Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship in order to document that the vessel is eligible for documentation with a fishery endorsement. The certification should indicate that the vessel meets the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section; however, it is eligible to be documented with a fishery endorsement because it complies with the requirements of either paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section. A sample form for the certification is available on the MARAD Web site at http://www.marad.dot.gov/afa.html or may be obtained by contacting the Citizenship Approval Officer.

              Exemptions for specific vessels.
              (a) The following Fishing Industry Vessels are exempt from the new ownership and control standards under the AFA and this part 356 for vessel owners and Mortgagees:
              (1) Fishing Industry Vessels engaged in fisheries in the exclusive economic zone under the authority of the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council established under section 302(a)(1)(H) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1852(a)(1)(H)); and
              (2) Purse seine vessels when they are engaged in tuna fishing in the Pacific Ocean outside the exclusive economic zone of the United States or pursuant to the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Treaty.

            Subpart H—International Agreements
            
              § 356.53
              Conflicts with international agreements.
              (a) If the owner or Mortgagee of a Fishing Industry Vessel believes that there is a conflict between the AFA or 46 CFR part 356 and any international treaty or agreement to which the United States is a party on July 24, 2001, and to which the United States is currently a party, the owner or Mortgagee may petition the Chief Counsel of the Maritime Administration at any time after July 19, 2000 to request a ruling that all or part of the requirements of this part 356 do not apply to that particular owner or particular Mortgagee with respect to a specific vessel; provided, the petitioner had an ownership interest in the Fishing Industry Vessel, or a mortgage on the vessel in the case of a Mortgagee, on July 24, 2001, and is covered by the international agreement.
              (b) A petition for exemption from the requirements of this part 356 must include:
              (1) Evidence of the ownership structure, or mortgage structure in the case of a Mortgagee, of the Fishing Industry Vessel as of July 24, 2001 (or on the date of the petition, for petitions filed prior to July 24, 2001), and any subsequent changes to the ownership structure, or mortgage structure in the case of a Mortgagee, of the vessel;
              (2) A copy of the provisions of the international agreement or treaty which the owner or mortgagee believes are in conflict with the regulations in this part 356;
              (3) A detailed description of how the provisions of the international agreement or treaty and the regulations in this part 356 are in conflict; and
              (4) A certification in all petitions filed on or after July 24, 2001, that no interest in the vessel-owning entity has been transferred to a Non-Citizen after July 24, 2001.
              (c) A separate petition must be filed for each Fishing Industry Vessel for which the vessel owner or a Mortgagee is requesting an exemption unless the Chief Counsel authorizes consolidated filing. Petitions should include two copies of all materials and should be sent to the following address: Maritime Administration, Chief Counsel, Room 7228, 400 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.

              (d) Upon receipt of a complete petition, the Chief Counsel may publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting public comment if the petition presents unique issues that have not been addressed in previous determinations. The Federal Register notice will include the petitioner's descriptions regarding how the AFA and this part 356 are in conflict with a particular investment treaty or agreement, but it will not include proprietary or confidential information about the petitioner. The Chief Counsel, in consultation with other departments and agencies within the Federal Government that have responsibility or expertise related to the interpretation or application of international investment agreements (e.g., the Department of State, United States Trade Representative, Department of Treasury, etc.), will review the petition and the public comments, if any, to determine whether the international agreement and the requirements of the AFA and this part 356 are in conflict and, absent any extenuating circumstances, will render a decision within 120 days of the receipt of a fully completed petition. If MARAD's Chief Counsel determines after the receipt of a fully completed petition that there are extenuating circumstances that will preclude a decision from being rendered on the petition within 120 days, the petitioner will be notified around the 90th day and provided with an estimated date on which a decision will be rendered.

              (e) To the extent that it is determined that an international agreement covering the petitioner is in conflict with the requirements of this part 356, the AFA, 46 U.S.C. 31322(a), 46 U.S.C. 12102(c), and this part 356 will not be applied to the petitioner with respect to the specific vessel. If the petitioner is a vessel owner, it will be required to comply with the documentation requirements as in effect prior to passage of the AFA on October 21, 1998. If the petitioner is a Mortgagee, it will be subject to requirements of 46 U.S.C. 31322(a) as in effect prior to passage of the AFA with regard to the mortgage on the particular vessel covered by the petition. Decisions of the Chief Counsel may be appealed to the Maritime Administrator within 15 business days of issuance.
              (f) The owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel that is determined through the petition process to be exempt from all or part of the requirements of this part 356 must submit evidence of its ownership structure to the Chief Counsel on an annual basis. The owner must specifically set forth:
              (1) The Vessel's current ownership structure;
              (2) The identity of all Non-Citizen owners and the percentage owned;
              (3) Any changes in the ownership structure that have occurred since the filing of the last Affidavit; and,
              (4) A certification that no interest in the vessel was transferred to a Non-Citizen after July 24, 2001.
              (g) The provisions of this part 356 shall apply:
              (1) To all owners and Mortgagees of a Fishing Industry Vessel who acquired an interest in the vessel after July 24, 2001; and
              (2) To the owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel on July 24, 2001, if any ownership interest in that owner is transferred to or otherwise acquired by a Non-Citizen or if the percentage of foreign ownership in the vessel is increased after such date.
              (3) An ownership interest is deemed to be transferred under this paragraph (g) if:
              (i) There is a transfer of direct ownership interest in the primary vessel owning entity. If the primary vessel owning entity is wholly owned by another entity, the parent entity will be considered the primary vessel owning entity; or
              (ii) There is a transfer of indirect ownership at any tier.
              (4) A transfer of interest in a vessel owner does not include:
              (i) Transfers of disparately held shares of a vessel-owning entity if it is a publicly traded company and the total of the shares transferred in a particular transaction equals less than 5% of the shares in that class. An interest in a vessel owning entity that exceeds 5% of the shares in a class can not be sold to the same Non-Citizen through multiple transactions involving less than 5% of the shares of that class of stock in order to maintain the exemption for the vessel owner; or
              (ii) Transfers pursuant to a divorce or death.

            Subpart I—Review of Harvesting and Processing Compliance
            
              § 356.55
              Review of compliance with harvesting and processing quotas.
              (a) Upon the request of either the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (“NPFMC”) or the Secretary of Commerce, the Chief Counsel will review any allegation that an individual or entity has exceeded the allowable percentage for harvesting or processing pollock as provided for in section 210(e)(1) or (2) of the AFA.
              (b) Following a request for MARAD review under paragraph (a) of this section, the NPFMC and the Secretary of Commerce (through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Marine Fisheries Service) will transmit to MARAD any relevant information in their possession including, but not limited to:
              (1) The identity of the parties alleged to have exceeded the excessive share caps;
              (2) The relevant harvesting or processing data (the amount harvested or processed by particular parties);
              (3) Any information that would be helpful in determining if the parties are related;
              (4) Any information regarding the ownership structure of the parties, including:
              (i) Articles of incorporation;
              (ii) Bylaws;
              (iii) Identity of shareholders and the percentage owned;
              (iv) Any contracts or agreements that would demonstrate ownership or control of one party by another allegedly related party; and
              (v) Any other evidence that would demonstrate ownership or control of one party by another allegedly related party.

              (c) If MARAD determines during the course of its review that additional information is required from the parties alleged to have exceeded the excessive share cap, the Chief Counsel will advise the Secretary of Commerce and/or the NPFMC what information is required. The Secretary and/or the NPFMC will request that specific parties submit the required information to MARAD.
              (d) The Chief Counsel will make a finding as soon as practicable and will submit it to the Secretary of Commerce and the NPFMC.
              (e) For purposes of this section, if 10% or more of the interest in an entity is owned or controlled either directly or indirectly by another individual or entity, the two entities will be considered the same entity for purposes of applying the harvesting and processing caps.
              (1) For purposes of this section, an entity will be deemed to have an ownership interest in a pollock harvesting or processing entity if it either owns a percentage of the pollock harvesting or processing entity directly or if ownership can be traced through intermediate entities to the pollock harvesting or processing entity. To determine the percentage of ownership interest that an entity has in a pollock harvesting or processing entity where the ownership interest passes through one or more intermediate entities, the entity's percentage of direct interest in an intermediate entity is multiplied by the intermediate entity's percentage of direct or indirect interest in the pollock harvesting or processing entity.
              (2) For purposes of this section, an entity will be deemed to exercise 10% or greater control over a pollock harvesting or processing entity if:
              (i) It has the right to direct the business of the pollock harvesting or processing entity;
              (ii) It has the right to appoint members to the management team of the pollock harvesting or processing entity such as the directors of a corporation or is a general partner or joint venturer in a harvesting or processing entity;
              (iii) It has the right to direct the business of an entity that directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% of a harvesting or processing entity; or
              (iv) It owns 50% or more of an entity that owns or controls 10 percent of a pollock harvesting or processing entity.
              (f) If the Secretary of Commerce determines that there is enough evidence to pursue an enforcement action for violation of the harvesting or processing caps contained in section 210(e) of the AFA, the Person against whom an enforcement action is taken is entitled to notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary of Commerce in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554.

              (a) Time-barred claim means a claim against the Government, for which the statutory period for filing suit has expired.

              General policy.
              (a) Time-barred claims shall be rejected, except as follows:
              (1) A time-barred claim which could be asserted in court by way of set-off against a claim in favor of the United States arising out of the same contract may be considered in an overall settlement where settlement will result in a net payment to the United States, provided claimant releases the United States from all claims arising from or in any way connected with said contract.

              (2) Time-barred claims in favor of friendly foreign governments shall not be rejected solely because they are time-barred. However, should any such government adopt the practice of asserting the statute of limitations as a defense against claims of the United States, the time-barred claims of that government shall be rejected.
              (3) Time-barred claims arising under Second Seamen's War Risk insurance (or similar earlier types of crew insurance) where the policy was issued or the risks were assumed by the Maritime Administration (or its predecessors), shall not be rejected where the beneficiaries were precluded from receiving the proceeds of the policy by reason of regulations or orders of the U.S. Government (i) by reason of the beneficiary being physically or mentally unable to present the claim, (ii) by the beneficiaries being unaware of their entitlement to the proceeds in question, or (iii) where the claim is not “stale” under general principles of equity.
              (b) For the purpose of a claim by a General Agent under General Agency Agreements set forth in 32A CFR AGE-1 for reimbursement by the Maritime Administration on account of a timely payment made to a third party within a period of limitations running from the date the claim of the third party accrued, the period of limitations applicable to the General Agent shall run from the date of such payment. In all other cases involving claims arising under General Agency Agreements, including third-party claims, the policy provided in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply.
              (c) Consideration of any claim governed by applicable regulations in this chapter II, including without limitation parts 272, 292, and 205 of this chapter, shall be controlled by the time limitations expressly provided for with respect to the submission of such claims.

              (b) With respect to books, records, and accounts which, subject to the provision of paragraph (a) of this section, are to be disposed of upon the expiration of the minimum retention period prescribed herein, there shall be filed with the Records Officer, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC, 20590, a written notification, at least thirty (30) days prior to the contemplated, disposal requesting permission to dispose of records.

Within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notification the Records Officer shall grant approval for disposal, or advise the necessity for continued retention of all or any specified portion thereof. Failure of the Record Officer to reply within the thirty (30) days period following receipt by the Administration of such request shall constitute approval.
              (c) Applications for special authority to dispose of certain books, records, and accounts prior to the expiration of prescribed minimum retention periods, and any inquiries as to the interpretation or applicability of this subpart to specific items shall be submitted to the Records Officer, Maritime Administration.

The information listed in paragraph (a) of this section shall be furnished to the Maritime Administration in a format prepared by the reporting department or agency and approved by the Maritime Administrator, Department of Transportation as suitable for the purpose of carrying out his responsibility under section 901(b)(2) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, pursuant to the authority delegated to him thereunder by the Secretary of Transportation under section 3 of Department Organization Order 10-8, 36 FR 1223. Where obtainable, a properly notated and legible copy of the ocean bill of lading in English will suffice. Reporting formats shall be submitted for approval by April 30, 1971.
            (c) Shipments made subject to the Act. In those instances where a shipment has been made that was not known to be subject to the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 when it was made, but subsequent events cause it to be subject to that Act, the agency taking the action that caused the shipment to be subject to the Act shall furnish to the Office of National Cargo and Compliance the information listed in paragraph (a) of this section in the approved reporting form.

            Fair and reasonable participation.
            In order to insure a fair and reasonable participation by U.S.-flag commercial vessels in liner parcel cargoes subject to the Cargo Preference Act of 1954, as required by that Act, the head of each department or agency having responsibility under that Act shall prescribe regulations or formal staff instructions providing for the cargo mix of liner parcel cargoes transported on ocean vessels to be divided between privately owned U.S.-flag vessels and foreign-flag vessels in such a manner as to yield to the U.S.-flag vessels freight revenue per long ton at least equal to the freight revenue per long ton afforded the foreign-flag vessels participating in the same grant, loan, or purchase transaction. A copy of the regulations or staff instructions prescribed by each department or agency shall be furnished to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, no later than June 30, 1971, for approval.

            Informal grievance procedure.
            (a) Whenever any person has a question, problem, complaint, grievance, or controversy pertaining to the terms and conditions of any tenders, charter party terms, or other matter involving the administration of the Cargo Preference Act of 1954, such person may request the Maritime Administration to afford him an opportunity to discuss the matter informally with representatives of the Maritime Administration and, if other U.S. Government agencies or foreign missions, embassies, or agencies acting on behalf of a foreign government are involved with them or persons authorized to speak for them.

            (b) In such cases, a request may be made by telephone or letter to the Chief, Office of Market Development, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366-4610. When such a request has been received, the Maritime Administrator, Department of Transportation or his designated representative will promptly consider the matter on its merits and provide assistance if possible. If the matter cannot be resolved satisfactorily by the Maritime Administration, the Maritime Administrator, Department of Transportation or his designated representative will then arrange for a meeting at a time and place satisfactory to all interested parties so that the matter may be freely discussed and resolved.
            (c) At such meetings, the Maritime Administrator, Department of Transportation or his designated representative may request any U.S. Government agency, foreign mission, embassy, or agency acting on behalf of a foreign government, or others having an interest in the matter to attend such a conference, or to send representatives authorized to speak for them. All such meetings and conferences will be conducted in an informal manner.

            § 381.7
            Federal Grant, Guaranty, Loan and Advance of Funds Agreements.
            In order to insure a fair and reasonable participation by privately owned United States-flag commercial vessels in transporting cargoes which are subject to the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 and which are generated by U.S. Government Grant, Guaranty, Loan and/or Advance of Funds Programs, the head of each affected department or agency shall require appropriate clauses to be inserted in those Grant, Guaranty, Loan and/or Advance of Funds Agreements and all third party contracts executed between the borrower/grantee and other parties, where the possibility exists for ocean transportation of items procurred, contracted for or otherwise obtained by or on behalf of the grantee, borrower, or any of their contractors or subcontractors. The clauses required by this part shall provide that at least 50 percent of the freight revenue and tonnage of cargo generated by the U.S. Government Grant, Guaranty, Loan or Advance of Funds be transported on privately owned United States-flag commercial vessels. These clauses shall also require that all parties provide to the Maritime Administration the necessary shipment information as set forth in § 381.3. A copy of the appropriate clauses required by this part shall be submitted by each affected agency or department to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, for approval no later than 30 days after the effective date of this part. The following are suggested acceptable clauses with respect to the use of United States-flag vessels to be incorporated in the Grant, Guaranty, Loan and/or Advance of Funds Agreements as well as contracts and subcontracts resulting therefrom:
            (a) Agreement Clauses. “Use of United States-flag vessels:
            “(1) Pursuant to Pub. L. 664 (43 U.S.C. 1241(b)) at least 50 percent of any equipment, materials or commodities procured, contracted for or otherwise obtained with funds granted, guaranteed, loaned, or advanced by the U.S. Government under this agreement, and which may be transported by ocean vessel, shall be transported on privately owned United States-flag commercial vessels, if available.
            “(2) Within 20 days following the date of loading for shipments originating within the United States or within 30 working days following the date of loading for shipments originating outside the United States, a legible copy of a rated, ‘on-board’ commercial ocean bill-of-lading in English for each shipment of cargo described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be furnished to both the Contracting Officer (through the prime contractor in the case of subcontractor bills-of-lading) and to the Division of National Cargo, Office of Market Development, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590.”
            (b) Contractor and Subcontractor Clauses. “Use of United States-flag vessels: The contractor agrees—

            “(1) To utilize privately owned United States-flag commercial vessels to ship at least 50 percent of the gross tonnage (computed separately for dry bulk carriers, dry cargo liners, and tankers) involved, whenever shipping any equipment, material, or commodities pursuant to this contract, to the extent such vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates for United States-flag commercial vessels.
            “(2) To furnish within 20 days following the date of loading for shipments originating within the United States or within 30 working days following the date of loading for shipments originating outside the United States, a legible copy of a rated, ‘on-board’ commercial ocean bill-of-lading in English for each shipment of cargo described in paragraph (b) (1) of this section to both the Contracting Officer (through the prime contractor in the case of subcontractor bills-of-lading) and to the Division of National Cargo, Office of Market Development, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590.

            Subsidized vessel participation.
            (a) For the purpose of approving subsidized U.S.-flag liner and bulk vessels competing for the carriage of dry bulk preference cargoes, each department or agency having responsibility under the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 (46 U.S.C. 1214(b)), shall evaluate bids received from the operators of such vessels in the manner described in this section.
            (b) When a subsidized vessel operator is the apparent low U.S.-flag responsive bidder for a dry bulk preference cargo, the responsible department or agency shall evaluate the subsidized operator's bid by:
            (1) Requesting from MARAD an amount for the operating-differential subsidy (ODS) likely to be paid for the carriage of such cargo expressed as a cost per ton for performing the voyage by the apparent low responsive subsidized bidders;
            (2) Deriving “augmented bids” for the subsidized operators by adding the ODS amount to each subsidized operator's bid;
            (3) Comparing the augmented bids of the subsidized operators and the bids of unsubsidized operators to determine the apparent low responsive bidder;
            (4) Requesting from MARAD a fair and reasonable guideline rate for the apparent low responsive bidder which shall be based on MARAD's calculation of anticipated costs (less ODS in the case of a subsidized vessel) for the voyage plus a reasonable amount for profit for the voyage; and
            (5) Determining whether the subsidized operator's unaugmented bid or the unsubsidized operator's bid, whichever was determined to be the lowest responsive bid pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, is at or below the fair and reasonable guideline rate.
            (c) If the amount of dry bulk cargo to be shipped is changed at any time prior to award, the department or agency shall request that MARAD provide new ODS amounts applicable to the carriage. The department or agency shall redetermine the augmented bids before determining the lowest responsive bid and requesting from MARAD a revised fair and reasonable guideline rate in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
            (d) Whenever a bid is submitted for a U.S.-flag vessel for the transportation of dry bulk preference cargo, the responsible department or agency shall only approve bids that apply to an individual vessel, and may not accept combined bids submitted for more than one vessel. If two or more vessels are offered, separate bids shall be submitted for each vessel. A bidder may submit a conditional lower bid for each vessel to be effective only if more than one vessel is contracted to carry the cargo.
            (e) The requirements of this section shall apply only to those departments or agencies that directly pay or finance all or part of U.S.-flag ocean freight transportation costs for the carriage of dry bulk preference cargoes, in accordance with this part.

            (f) The requirements of this section shall not apply to foreign aid consisting of direct cash transfer payments under specific agreements between departments or agencies and the recipient country with respect to the utilization of U.S.-flag vessels for transportation of commodities purchased with such funds.

            Available U.S.-flag service.
            For purposes of shipping bulk agricultural commodities under programs administered by sponsoring Federal agencies from U.S. Great Lakes ports during the 1996-2000 Great Lakes shipping seasons, if direct all-U.S.-flag service, at fair and reasonable rates, is not available at U.S. Great Lakes ports, a joint service involving a foreign-flag vessel(s) carrying cargo no farther than a Canadian port(s) or other point(s) on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with transshipment via a U.S.-flag privately-owned commercial vessel to the ultimate foreign destination, will be deemed to comply with the requirement of “available” commercial U.S.-flag service under the Cargo Preference Act of 1954. Shipper agencies considering bids resulting in the lowest landed cost of transportation based on U.S.-flag rates and service shall include within the comparison of U.S.-flag rates and service, for shipments originating in U.S. Great Lakes ports, through rates (if offered) to a Canadian port or other point on the Gulf of St. Lawrence and a U.S.-flag leg for the remainder of the voyage. The “fair and reasonable” rate for this mixed service will be determined by considering the U.S.-flag component under the existing regulations at 46 CFR part 382 or 383, as appropriate, and incorporating the cost for the foreign-flag component into the U.S.-flag “fair and reasonable” rate in the same way as the cost of foreign-flag vessels used to lighten U.S.-flag vessels in the recipient country's territorial waters. Alternatively, the supplier of the commodity may offer the Cargo FOB Canadian transshipment point, and MARAD will determine fair and reasonable rates accordingly.

            Scope.
            The regulations in this part prescribe the type of information that shall be submitted to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) by operators interested in carrying bulk and packaged preference cargoes, and the method for calculating fair and reasonable rates for the carriage of dry (including packaged) and liquid bulk preference cargoes on U.S.-flag commercial vessels, except vessels engaged in liner trades, which is defined as service provided on an advertised schedule, giving relatively frequent sailings between specific U.S. ports or ranges and designated foreign ports or ranges.
          
          
            § 382.2
            Data submission.
            (a) General. The operators shall submit information, described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, to the Director, Office of Costs and Rates, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590. To the extent a vessel is time chartered, the operator shall also submit operating expenses for that vessel. All submissions shall be certified by the operators. A further review based on the independent CPA performing an engagement consistent with professional standards, i.e., an attestation engagement, is recommended. Submissions are subject to verification, at MARAD's discretion, by the Office of the Inspector General, Department of Transportation. MARAD's calculations of the fair and reasonable rates for U.S.-flag vessels shall be performed on the basis of cost data provided by the U.S.-flag vessel operator, as specified herein. If a vessel operator fails to submit the required cost data, MARAD will not construct the guideline rate for the affected vessel, which may result in such vessel not being approved by the sponsoring Federal agency.
            (b) Required vessel information. The following information shall be submitted not later than April 30, 1998, for calendar year 1997 and shall be updated not later than April 30 for each subsequent calendar year. In instances where a vessel has not previously participated in the carriage of cargoes described in § 382.1, the information shall be submitted not later than the same date as the offer for carriage of such cargoes is submitted to the sponsoring Federal agency, and/or its program participant, and/or its agent and/or program's agent, or freight forwarder.
            (1) Vessel name and official number.
            (2) Vessel DWT (summer) in metric tons.
            (3) Date built, rebuilt and/or purchased.
            (4) Normal operating speed.
            (5) Daily fuel consumption at normal operating speed, in metric tons (U.S. gallons for tugs) and by type of fuel.
            (6) Daily fuel consumption in port while pumping and standing, in metric tons (U.S. gallons for tugs) and by type of fuel.
            (7) Total capitalized vessel costs (list and date capitalized improvements separately), and applicable interest rates for indebtedness (where capital leases are involved, the operator shall report the imputed capitalized cost and imputed interest rate).
            (8) Operating cost information, to be submitted in the format stipulated in 46 CFR 232.1, on Form MA-172, Schedule 310. Operators are encouraged to provide operating cost information for similar vessels that the operator considers substitutable within a category, as defined in § 382.3(a)(1), in the aggregate on a single schedule. Information shall be applicable to the most recently completed calendar year.
            (9) Number of vessel operating days pertaining to data reported in paragraph (b)(8) of this section for the year ending December 31. For purposes of this part, an operating day means any day on which a vessel or tug/barge unit is in a seaworthy condition, fully manned, and either in operation or standing ready to begin pending operations.
            (c) Required port and cargo handling information. The port and cargo handling costs listed in this paragraph shall be provided semiannually for each cargo preference voyage terminated during the period. The report shall identify the vessel, cargo and tonnage, and round-trip voyage itinerary including dates of arrival and departure at port or ports of loading and discharge. The semiannual periods and the information to be submitted are as follows:
            
              
                Period

            (1) Port expenses. Total expenses or fees, by port, for pilots, tugs, line handlers, wharfage, port charges, fresh water, lighthouse dues, quarantine service, customs charges, shifting expenses, and any other appropriate port expense.
            (2) Cargo expense. Separately list expenses or fees for stevedores, elevators, equipment, and any other appropriate expenses.
            (3) Extra cargo expenses. Separately list expenses or fees for vacuvators and/or cranes, lightering (indicate tons moved and cost per ton), grain-to-grain cleaning of holds or tanks, and any other appropriate expenses.
            (4) Canal expenses. Total expenses or fees for agents, tolls (light or loaded), tugs, pilots, lock tenders and boats, and any other appropriate expenses. Indicate waiting time and time of passage.
            (d) Other requirements. Unless otherwise provided, operators shall use generally accepted accounting principles and MARAD's regulations at 46 CFR part 232, Uniform Financial Reporting Requirements, for guidance in submitting cost data. Notwithstanding the general provisions in 46 CFR 232.2(c) for MARAD program participants, each operator shall submit cost data in the format that conforms with the accounting practices reflected in the operator's trial balance and, if audited statements are prepared, the audited financial statements. Data requirements stipulated in paragraph (b) of this section that are not included under those reporting instructions shall be submitted in a similar format. If the operator has already submitted to MARAD, for other purposes, any data required under paragraph (b) of this section, its submission need not be duplicated to satisfy the requirements of this part.
            (e) Presumption of confidentiality. MARAD will initially presume that the material submitted in accordance with the requirements of this part is privileged or confidential within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). In the event of a subsequent request for any portion of that data under the FOIA, MARAD will inform the submitter of such request and allow the submitter the opportunity to comment. The submitter shall claim or reiterate its claim of confidentiality at that time by memorandum or letter, stating the basis for such assertions of exemption from disclosure. The Freedom of Information Act Officer, or the Chief Counsel of MARAD, will inform the submitter of the intention to disclose any information claimed to be confidential, after the initial FOIA request, or after any appeal of MARAD's initial decision, respectively.

            § 382.3
            Determination of fair and reasonable rate.
            Fair and reasonable rates for the carriage of preference cargoes on U.S.-flag commercial vessels shall be determined as follows:
            (a) Operating cost component—(1) General. An operating cost component for each category, based on average operating costs of participating vessels within a vessel size category, shall be determined, at least twice yearly, on the basis of operating cost data for the calendar year immediately preceding the current year that has been submitted in accordance with § 382.2. The operating cost component shall include all operating cost categories, as specified in 46 CFR 232.5, Form MA-172, Schedule 310, Operating Expenses. For purposes of these regulations, charter hire expenses are not considered operating costs. MARAD shall index such data yearly to the current period, utilizing the escalation factors for wage and non-wage costs used in escalating operating subsidy costs for the same period.
            (2) Fuel. Fuel costs within each category shall be determined based on the average actual fuel consumptions, at sea and in port, and current fuel prices in effect at the time of the preference cargo voyage(s).
            (3) Vessel categories. Vessels shall be placed in categories by deadweight capacities (DWT), as follows:
            
            
              Group I—under 10,000 DWT
              Group II—10,000—19,999 DWT
              Group III—20,000—34,999 DWT
              Group IV—35,000 DWT and over.
            
            
            (b) Capital Component—(1) General. An average capital cost component for each category shall be constructed, at least twice yearly, consisting of vessel depreciation, interest, and return on equity.
            (2) Items included. The capital cost component shall include:
            (i) Depreciation. The owners' capitalized vessel costs, including capitalized improvements, shall be depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 20-year economic life, except vessels purchased or reconstructed when their age was greater than 10 years old. To the extent vessels are chartered or leased, the operator shall submit the capitalized cost of the vessel owner and imputed interest rate. If these items are not furnished, MARAD will construct these amounts. When vessels more than 10 years old are acquired, a depreciation period of 10 years shall be used. Capitalized improvements made to vessels more than 10 years old shall be depreciated over a 10-year period. When vessels more than 10 years old are reconstructed, MARAD will determine the depreciation period.
            (ii) Interest. The cost of debt shall be determined by applying each vessel owner's actual interest rates to the outstanding vessel indebtedness. MARAD shall assume that original vessel indebtedness is 75 percent of the owners' capitalized vessel costs, including capitalized improvements, and that annual principal payments are made in equal installments over the economic life of the vessels as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Where an operator uses a variable interest rate, the operator's actual interest rate at the time of calculation of the average capital cost component shall be used. The ten-year Treasury bill (T-bill) rate plus one percent on the first business day of the year or the first business day on or after July 1 shall be used for operators without vessel debt and when the actual rate is unavailable.
            (iii) Return on equity. The rate of return on equity shall be computed in the same manner as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For the purpose of determining equity, it shall be assumed that the vessel's constructed net book value, less outstanding constructed principal, is equity. The constructed net book values shall equal the owners' capitalized cost minus accumulated straight-line depreciation.
            (3) Return on working capital. For each voyage a return on working capital shall be included as a voyage related capital cost element, and thus not part of the averaged costs. Working capital shall equal the dollar amount necessary to cover 100 percent of the averaged operating costs and estimated voyage costs for the voyage. The rate of return shall be based on an average of the most recent return of stockholders' equity for a cross section of transportation companies, including maritime companies.
            (4) New vessel allowance. Newly constructed vessels and vessels acquired during or before their fifth year of age will receive an additional allowance for acquisition capital as part of the capital cost element. For the first year following construction or acquisition by the operator, a daily amount equal to ten percent of capitalized acquisition costs, divided by 300 operating days, shall be included. This amount shall be reduced by one percent of capitalized acquisition costs each subsequent year. No allowance shall be included after the tenth year following construction.
            (5) Voyage component. The annual average depreciation, interest, and return on equity for vessels in each category shall be divided by 300 vessel operating days to yield the daily cost factors. Total voyage days shall be applied to the daily cost factors and totaled with the return on working capital and new vessel allowance for the voyage to determine the daily capital cost component.
            (c) Port and cargo handling cost component. MARAD shall calculate an estimate of all port and cargo handling costs on the basis of the reported cargo tender terms. The port and cargo handling cost component shall be based on vessels in the category and the most current information available verified by information submitted in accordance with § 382.2(c), or as otherwise determined by MARAD, such as by analysis of independent data obtained from chartering agencies.
            (d) Brokerage and overhead component. An allowance for broker's commission and overhead expenses of 8.5 percent shall be added to the sum of the operating cost component, the capital cost component, and the port and cargo handling cost component.
            (e) Determination of voyage days. The following assumptions shall be made in determining the number of preference cargo voyage days:
            (1) The voyage shall be round-trip with the return in ballast to a port or port range selected by MARAD as the most appropriate, unless the vessel is scrapped or sold after discharge of the preference cargo and does not return to the United States as a U.S.-flag vessel. In this event, only voyage days from the load port to the discharge port, including time allowed to discharge, shall be included.
            (2) Cargo is loaded and discharged as per cargo tender terms interpreted in accordance with the “International Rules For the Interpretation of Trade Terms” (INCOTERMS) published by the International Chamber of Commerce.
            (3) Total loading and discharge time includes the addition of a factor to account for delays and days not worked.
            (4) One extra port day is included at each anticipated bunkering port.
            (5) An allowance shall be included for canal transits, when appropriate.

            (6) Transit time shall be based on the average speed of vessels in the category. When calculating the vessels' average speed, individual vessel speeds will be reduced by five percent for self-propelled vessels and ten percent for tugs/barges to account for weather conditions.
            (f) Determination of cargo carried. The amount of cargo tonnage used to calculate the rate shall be based on the tender offer or charter party terms. In instances when separate parcels of preference cargo are booked or considered for booking on the same vessel, whether under a single program or different programs, a guideline rate shall be provided based on the combined voyage.
            (g) Total rate. The guideline rate shall be the total of the operating cost component, the capital cost component, the port and cargo handling cost component, and the broker's commission and overhead component. The fair and reasonable rate can be expressed as total voyage revenue or be divided by the amount of cargo to be carried, as prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section, and expressed as cost per ton, whichever MARAD deems most appropriate.

              § 385.1
              Scope.
              This part sets forth information about the Maritime Administration (MarAd) assistance regulations: Their purpose, authority, applicability, issuance, arrangement, implementation, and exception procedure; definitions of terms; and general MarAd assistance policies.
            
          
          
            Regulation System
            
              § 385.2
              Scope.

              Sections 385.2 through 385.9 set forth introductory information pertaining to the MarAd assistance regulations: Their purpose, authority, applicability, exclusions, issuance, arrangement, publication, and exceptions.
            
            
              § 385.3
              Purpose.
              Sections 385.2 through 385.9 establish the MarAd assistance regulations which codify, implement, and publish uniform assistance policies and selected procedures applicable to MarAd and recipients of MarAd assistance awards. The MarAd assistance regulations do not, in and of themselves, provide authority for the use of assistance instruments nor the making of assistance awards where statutory authority has not been otherwise provided. Generic authority to award grants and cooperative agreements is provided in Pub. L. 95-224, the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977. The assistance regulations are distinct from the Federal and MarAd and Department of Transportation procurement regulations.
            
            
              § 385.4
              Authority.
              The MarAd assistance regulations are issued pursuant to section 204(b) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. 1114(b)), and pursuant to delegation of authority by the Secretary of Transportation to the Maritime Administrator, Department of Transportation.
            
            
              § 385.5
              Applicability.
              The MarAd assistance regulations apply to all MarAd research and development programs which will result in assistance awards, and to all recipients eligible for MarAd assistance awards such as state and local governments, institutions of higher education, hospitals, other nonprofit organizations, individuals, profitmaking organizations, and foreign organizations. The provisions of this part govern the award and administration of all such financial assistance matters, including resolutions and guidelines issued by MarAd except:
              (a) As otherwise required by statute; and,
              (b) As otherwise provided by specific program regulations.
            
            
              § 385.6
              Exclusions.
              Excluded from this part are requirements pertaining to procurement contracts subject to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and the Federal and MarAd procurement regulations, interagency agreements, memorandums of understanding and programs or projects which directly disseminate technical information, or provide consultation, technical service, information, and data counseling to recipients without the use of an assistance instrument. Also excluded is the sale, lease, license, or other authorization to use Federal property, when such use is not incidental to the purpose of stimulation or support.
            
            
              § 385.7
              Issuance.

              The MarAd assistance regulations are issued in the Code of Federal Regulations as Part 385, Chapter II, of Title 46, Shipping, after publication in the Federal Register. Copies of the MarAd assistance regulations in the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
            
            
              § 385.8
              Arrangement.
              (a) General Plan. The general format, numbering system, and nomenclature used in this part conform with Federal Register standards.
              (b) Citation. The MarAd assistance regulations will be cited in accordance with Federal Register standards. Thus, this paragraph, when referred to within divisions of the MarAd assistance regulations, should be cited as “§ 385.8(b).” When this section is referred to formally in other documents outside of this part, it should be cited as “46 CFR 385.8(b).”
              (c) Implementation. Instructions and procedures needed by MarAd to internally implement this part will be contained in a separate MarAd Financial Assistance Manual, which will be available to the public upon request.
            
            
              § 385.9
              Exceptions, deviations, or waivers.

              Requests for exceptions, deviations, or waivers from the requirements of this part, unless exceptions are required by program legislation or program regulations, shall be submitted to the Grants Officer. Exceptions may be approved by the Grants Officer on matters within the scope of his authority, or obtained by said Grants Officer from higher authority within the Department of Transportation or from the Office of Management and Budget when required by law or other applicable Federal requirement.
            
          
          
            Definition of Terms
            
              § 385.20
              Scope.
              Only those definitions needed to understand this part will be defined. Generally, terms defined elsewhere in statutes, OMB circulars, and other Federal requirements will not be restated. Special attention is directed to the definitions in the Standard General Provisions of MarAd's grant and cooperative agreements (See § 385.62).
            
            
              § 385.21
              Definitions.
              (a) Assistance is where the principal purpose of the relationship is the transfer of money, property, services or anything of value to a recipient in order to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute rather than of acquisition, by purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.
              (b) Assistance instrument is a general term which identifies a class of instruments used to award assistance. These instruments include grant and cooperative agreements, as defined in § 385.32 (c) and (d) of this part.
              (c) Act means the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-224).
              (d) MarAd means the Maritime Administration within the Department of Transportation.
              (e) Secretary means the Secretary of Transportation.
              (f) Maritime Administrator means the Maritime Administrator, Department of Transportation to whom the Secretary has delegated authority to administer within MarAd the provisions of the Act.
              (g) Grants Officer means the primary delegate of the Maritime Administrator responsible for administration of grants and cooperative agreements for research and development within MarAd.
              (h) Awards Officer means the principal executive subordinate to the Grants Officer responsible for the day-to-day administration of grants and cooperative agreements for research and development.
            
          
          
            General Policies
            
              § 385.31
              Scope.
              Sections 385.31 through 385.62 set forth the regulations applicable to all assistance instruments as defined herein.
            
            
              § 385.32
              Selection of award instrument.
              (a) General. This section provides guidance on the appropriate use of award instruments consistent with the Act and the supplementary interpretative guidelines required by section 9 of the Act, which were published by the OMB in the Federal Register of August 18, 1978 (41 FR 36860), and are incorporated by reference herein. This section applies to all program and individual transactions where the choice of award instruments is within the administrative discretion of MarAd and is not otherwise prescribed or limited by law. A variety of award instruments is available as the means for defining the terms and conditions and the nature of the relationship between MarAd and eligible recipients. The award instruments are intended to be different in purpose, application, content, and nature. When properly employed, they create different relationships between the parties. Because of these differences, the decision to use a particular instrument must be made deliberately. The determination of whether a program, to be implemented through individual transactions, is principally one of acquisition or assistance will be made by the Grants Officer. MarAd generally will employ the cooperative agreement form of assistance instrument but will employ the grant form where deemed appropriate.
              (b) Procurement contract. A procurement contract shall be used as the legal instrument to reflect a relationship between the Federal Government and a state or local government or other recipient whenever (1) the principal purpose of the instrument is the acquisition by purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government; or (2) whenever MarAd determines in a specific instance that the use of a type of procurement contract is appropriate.
              (c) Grant agreement. A type of grant agreement shall be used as the legal instrument to reflect a relationship between the Federal Government and a state or local government or other recipient whenever the principal purpose of the relationship is the transfer of money, property, services, or anything of value to the state or local government or other recipient in order to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute, rather than acquisition, by purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government; and no substantial involvement is anticipated between MarAd, acting for the Federal Government, and the state or local government or other recipient during performance of the contemplated activity.
              (d) Cooperative agreement. A type of cooperative agreement shall be used as the legal instrument to reflect a relationship between the Federal Government and a state or local government or other recipient whenever the principal purpose of the relationship is the transfer of money, property, services, or anything of value to the state or local government or other recipient in order to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute, rather than acquisition by purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government; and substantial involvement is anticipated between MarAd, acting for the Federal Government, and the state or local government or other recipient during performance of the contemplated activity.
            
            
              § 385.33
              Unsolicited applications and proposals for financial assistance awards.
              (a) Policy. Although it is MarAd policy to solicit applications and proposals for assistance awards where possible, MarAd also values obtaining innovative ideas, methods, and approaches in maritime transportation areas offered by the public through unsolicited applications and proposals. It is the policy of the Government to foster and encourage the submission of unsolicited proposals. This § 385.33 is designed to encourage the submisson of unsolicited proposals relating to MarAd's mission and to eliminate restraints which discourage the generation and acceptance of innovative ideas through unsolicited proposals.
              (b) Scope. This section applies to unsolicited proposals being considered for support through an assistance instrument. This section does not apply when a procurement contract is the appropriate award instrument in accordance with § 385.32(b).
              (c) Definition of unsolicited proposal. The term unsolicited proposal means a written offer to perform a proposed task or effort, initiated and submitted to MarAd by a prospective recipient (offeror) without solicitation by MarAd, and with the objective of obtaining an award. The term may include both requests for support of a new project and requests for additional support of a previously funded project (renewals).
              (d) Advance consultation. Organizations or individuals who are interested in submitting an unsolicited proposal are encouraged, before expending extensive effort in preparing a detailed unsolicited proposal or submitting any proprietary information to the Government, to make preliminary inquiries of MarAd program staff as to the general interest in the type of project contemplated. Prior contact with agency technical personnel is permissible and is encouraged, with the limited objectives of conveying to the prospective recipient an understanding of the agency mission and interest relative to the type of project contemplated. The project officer shall not indicate or imply in discussions with the potential proposer that a proposal will result in an award. Nothing is to be suggested to encourage or authorize the potential proposer to perform any work at MarAd expense in anticipation of support or an award. If there have been prior discussions with a particular MarAd program office, a statement of this fact should be stated on the face of the proposal.
              (e) Guides. Guides for preparing the content of unsolicited proposals are available from the Awards Officer (M-900), Maritime Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590. Notwithstanding these guides, state and local governments may submit unsolicited applications or proposals using the application forms authorized by OMB Circular No. A-102, Attachment M.
              (f) Submission point. All unsolicited proposals for new or renewals of financial assistance awards shall be submitted to Awards Officer (M-900), Maritime Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590.
              (g) Receipt and review. (1) Receipt of unsolicited proposals will be acknowledged promptly by the Awards Officer and then forwarded expeditiously to potentially interested program offices for comment. Each unsolicited proposal that is circulated for a comprehensive evaluation shall have a legend attached or imprinted on it by the Awards Officer, identifying it as an unsolicited proposal and stating that it shall be used only for purposes of evaluation.
              (2) The responsible program officials shall evaluate the proposal fairly and objectively using the criteria in §§ 385.50 through 385.52.

              (3) An unsolicited proposal may include data which the proposer does not want disclosed for purposes other than the evaluation of the proposal. In such case, the proposer should mark each page containing such data with the words “Proprietory Data—Restricted Use” at the top of the page. In the event that an unsolicited proposal, in whole or in part, indicates that the proposer wishes to impose restrictions on the use or disclosure of the data contained in the proposal, MarAd personnel handling the proposal will take care to ensure that the information in the proposal is not disclosed outside of MarAd. The Awards Officer has responsibility for ensuring that proposal reviewers are free of any direct affiliation with the individual(s) or institution submitting the proposal. MarAd policy on the use of information contained in proposals is to use such information only for evaluation purposes, except to the extent such information is generally available to the public, is already the property of the Government, or is available to the Government without restriction. Accordingly, if a proposal contains information the proposer wishes to protect, the proposer shall mark the cover page of the proposal with the following Notice:
              
              
                
                  Notice: The data contained in pages __ of this proposal have been submitted in confidence and contain trade secrets and/or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information, and such data shall be used or disclosed only for evaluation purposes: Provided, That if this proposer receives an award as a result of or in connection with the submission of this proposal the Government shall have the right to use or disclose the data herein to the extent provided in the award. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use or disclose data obtained without restriction from any source, including the proposer.
              
              
              MarAd shall ensure that all copies of the proposal carry the above Notice, and that it is not disclosed outside MarAd, except with the consent of the proposer.
              (h) Criteria for acceptance of an unsolicited proposal are those listed in §§ 385.50 through 385.52. If an unsolicited proposal fails to meet any of the criteria, the proposer will be notified by the Awards Officer in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.
              (i) Funding determination. The responsibility for deciding funding availability rests solely with the Grants Officer and will not be considered by the proposal reviewers.
              (j) Nonsupport of proposal. If the proposal does not offer sufficient technical merit or program value; is not relevant to the accomplishment of a public purpose authorized by MarAd program legislation; or if funds are not available; the proposal will be returned to the proposer, if the proposer so requests. The Awards Officer shall prepare a letter to the proposer which sets forth the basis for rejection of the unsolicited proposal or application.
              (k) Support of proposal. There is no prescribed format for the program documentation necessary to justify providing assistance. The minimum requirements are that: there be a reasonable basis for acceptance based on the criteria set forth in §§ 385.50 through 385.52; the rationale for providing support be written, and approvals be obtained as required by MarAd; and, that a copy of the documentation be included in the assistance instrument award file. The rationale for providing assistance may be included in documents required for project approval.
            
            
              § 385.34
              Responsibility for issuing solicitations for proposals or applications.
              (a) It is MarAd policy to favor solicitation of proposals or applications, where discretionary assistance awards are available, in preference to relying on unsolicited proposals, in order to maximize opportunities for open participation by the public in MarAd assistance awards.
              (b) The Awards Officer shall be responsible for issuing solicitations, announcements, or the like, which call for the submission of proposals and applications by a certain due date which, if favorably acted upon by MarAd, may result in assistance awards.
            
            
              § 385.35
              Program opportunity notices.
              (a) A program opportunity notice can be used to stimulate the flow of unsolicited proposals or applications when the program objectives cannot be defined sufficiently to prepare a program solicitation.
              (b) The program opportunity notice will contain the following, at a minimum:
              (1) A number assigned for control and reference purposes;
              (2) A brief description of the broad, general technical program or areas needing investigation (generally 50 words or less);
              (3) A statement of the principal program objective in possibly funding unsolicited proposals as either:
              (i) The acquisition of concepts, property, or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government; or
              (ii) The transfer of money, property, or services to a recipient for support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute;
              (4) A statement about how unsolicited proposals will be evaluated and accepted:
              (i) If the principal program objective is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation, the criteria in §§ 385.50 through 385.52 shall be applied;
              (ii) If the principal program objective is the acquisition of concepts, property, or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government (i.e., procurement), the policy regarding evaluation and acceptance of unsolicited proposals in 41 CFR 9-4.9 shall apply;
              (5) Restrictions, if any, as to who may submit proposals;
              (6) A contact where additional information may be obtained;
              (7) An expiration date which identifies when the program opportunity notice will no longer be current. This date shall not be used as a required common due date for submission of proposals;
              (8) A statement that MarAd reserves the right to support or not support, in whole or in part, any or all proposals received;
              (9) A statement that MarAd assumes no responsibility for any costs associated with specific proposal preparation if no award is made; but that if an award is made, MarAd will pay its allocable share of bid and proposal expenses as provided for in applicable Federal cost principles;
              (10) A statement that proposals submitted pursuant to the notice shall be mailed to the Awards Officer (M-900), Maritime Administration, Room 4885, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590.
              (11) A reference that detailed information concerning assistance policy and procedures is contained in these assistance regulations, 46 CFR part 385;
              (12) As much information as possible as to how proposals and applications will be evaluated;

              (13) Policies and procedures for patents, data, and copyrights. Proposers have the right to request in advance of or within thirty (30) days after the effective date of award a waiver of all or any part of the United States rights in subject inventions.
              (c) The program opportunity notice shall be in a format that best reflects the needs of the specific program, for example, letter, booklet, bulletin, or other documents.
              (d) The program opportunity notice shall be distributed widely.

              (e) The submission of innovative methods, approaches or ideas will not be restricted to those problems or technical areas published in the program opportunity notice. Alternatives will be eligible for consideration.
            
            
              § 385.36
              Public notice of availability of assistance awards.
              (a) In order to maximize involvement of prospective recipients in MarAd assistance programs, it is MarAd's policy, wherever possible, to provide timely notice to the public as to the availability of assistance awards.

              (b) Early notice regarding legislated grant or other assistance programs will br provided by MarAd to the Office of Management and Budget for publication in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance pursuant to Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-89. When legislated assistance programs or program objectives which are to be implemented through assistance instruments reach the point where applications or proposals need to be obtained, timely notice of such solicitations will be published in the Federal Register, Commerce Business Daily, trade and professional journals which are widely circulated to state and local governments, and news media, as appropriate to communicate with potentially interested applicants.
              (c) When a MarAd assistance project involves making assistance available through prime recipients to subrecipients, such as through states to local governments, prime recipients should provide timely advance notice to subrecipients as to the availability of such assistance, and provide a reasonable time period for subrecipients to prepare applications and secure prerequisite local approvals.
            
            
              § 385.37
              Requirement for unrestricted solicitations for discretionary assistance awards.
              (a) Policy. It is MarAd policy to maximize the opportunity for prospective recipients to be considered for assistance awards where eligibility is not prescribed by law. Therefore, when eligibility is not prescribed by law or a final program regulation, and when discretionary assistance awards are selected to accomplish a program objective, applications or proposals will be obtained, wherever practicable, by issuance of a written solicitation. When MarAd initiates the solicitation of applications or proposals, eligibility to be considered for discretionary awards will not be restricted by MarAd to one category of recipients or to a single recipient without adequate basis.
              (b) Justification of restricted eligibility. Where program legislation explicitly restricts eligibility, e.g., to state governments, no justification is required. When program regulations restrict eligibility beyond the restrictions required by the program legislation, the basis for the restriction shall be set forth in the program rulemaking.
              41 CFR 9-3.805-51 shall be used as a guide in preparing the “justification for restricting eligibility.” The reasons offered will be evaluated for consistency with the policy in paragraph (a) of this section, MarAd's overall mission, and the objective of maintaining an open and fair system of making assistance awards.
              (c) Approvals. Justifications of restricted eligibility will be signed by the Grants Officer and will be reviewed by Office of General Counsel for legal sufficiency prior to issuance of the restricted solicitation. The signed justification will be filed in official award file.
            
            
              § 385.38
              Joint funding.

              (a) Pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act, MarAd is authorized to participate in joint funded projects with other Federal agencies in any funding relationship which will serve the best interest of all of the participating agencies' program. Such joint funding project may include more than one type of assistance relationship, e.g., some components of project may be funded by grants and other components of the project may be funded by cooperative agreements.
              (b) It is MarAd's positive policy, further, to encourage cost-sharing on the part of applicants for financial assistance. The willingness of applicants to cost-share is a primary factor in making, or not making, an assistance award.
            
            
              § 385.39
              Socio-economic and environmental policies.
              A number of socio-economic and environmental policies of the Federal Government are incorporated into the standard general provisions of the grant agreement and cooperative agreements, and are identified as explicit criteria in §§ 385.51 and 385.52.
            
            
              § 385.40

              Scope.
              Sections 385.51 and 385.52 set forth the criteria to be used by MarAd in evaluating all projects and all potential recipients prior to award of a grant or cooperative agreement.

              (a) In terms of the accomplishment of a public purpose—
              (1) The potential contribution which the proposed work is expected to make to the MarAd assistance mission;
              (2) The economic, environmental, and societal significance which a successful demonstration or project may have for the nation, and in particular the national merchant marine program;
              (3) The relationship of the proposal to:
              (i) The public need for the potential results of the research, development, or demonstration effort, and whether it is unlikely that similar results would be achieved in a timely manner in the absence of Federal assistance;
              (ii) Whether the potential opportunities for non-Federal interests to recapture the investment in the undertaking through the normal commercial utilization of proprietary knowledge appear inadequate to encourage timely results;
              (iii) The extent of the problems treated and whether the objectives sought by the undertaking are national, widespread, or regional in their significance;
              (iv) The extent of opportunities to induce non-Federal support of the undertaking;
              (v) The degree of risk of loss of the investment inherent in the research, and the availability of risk capital to the non-Federal entities which might otherwise engage in the field of the research so as to further timely development of the technology; and,
              (vi) The availability of appropriations to MarAd.
              (b) In terms of the particular objectives of the project, whether the project has:
              (1) High technical merit which promises or represents an innovative idea, method, or approach;
              (2) Program value not previously recognized or pursued by MarAd; and,
              (3) A reasonable degree of probability of achieving the stated objectives.
            
            
              § 385.52
              Criteria: Applicant.
              The criteria to be used by MarAd in evaluating all applicants prior to award of a grant or cooperative agreement are as follows:
              (a) The qualifications, capabilities, resources (both financial and technical) and experience of the applicant;

              (b) The facilities or techniques which the proposer possesses and offers which are considered to be integral factors for achieving the objectives of the proposal;
              
              (c) The qualifications, capabilities, and experiences of the proposed investigator, team leader, or key personnel, who are considered to be critical in achieving the objectives of the proposal;
              (d) The precision and detail with which the applicant states its plan to further the formally adopted socioeconomic and environmental policies of the United States e.g., the encouragement of minority business enterprises); and,
              (e) The extent to which the applicant will share the total estimated cost of the project.
            
          
          
            Forms of Agreements

              § 385.61
              Grant and cooperative agreements: Special provisions.
              (a) MarAd has adopted two format matrices, one for grant agreements and one for cooperative agreements, to accommodate the variables inherent in undertaking a project with a particular recipient. These variables include, for example, identity of the recipient, scope of work, schedule of performance and obligations assumed by both parties.
              (b) The format matrices are available on request from the Awards Officer, and a copy of each is included in the information kit provided to all potential recipients of financial assistance. 1
                
              
              
                
                  1 An informational copy of both format matrices accompany this regulation as filed in the Office of the Federal Register.
              
              (c) MarAd will adapt the appropriate format matrix to the extent deemed necessary when drafting the particular agreement to be executed by MarAd and a recipient of financial assistance for a specific project.
            
            
              § 385.62
              Grant and cooperative agreements: Standard general provisions.
              (a) MarAd has adopted two standard general provisions which apply to grant and cooperative agreements, respectively, and said provisions are hereby incorporated by reference into these regulations. 2
                
              
              
                
                  2 A copy of both such incorporated provisions accompany this regulation and are on file in the Office of the Federal Register.
              

              (b) MarAd reserves the right to amend or to render inapplicable any portion of the particular standard general provisions required for any particular grant or cooperative agreement: Provided, That such modification shall be accomplished only by means of an explicit statement in the special provisions executed by MarAd and a particular recipient.

The Superintendent, or a designated representative of the Superintendent, shall make the decision to close all or any areas of Academy property. This action shall be coordinated with the Head, Department of Public Safety and Security (Security), of the Academy. When property, or a portion thereof, is closed to the public, admission to the property, or to any area thereof, shall be restricted to authorized persons, who shall register with Security personnel upon entry to the property. When requested, any person shall display Government or other identifying credentials to Security personnel when entering, leaving, or while on Academy property.

These prohibitions shall not apply in cases where drugs are being used as prescribed for a patient by a licensed physician. The prohibition against possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages shall not apply when possessed or consumed by staff or resident officers in private residences, or when the Superintendent, or a designee of the Superintendent, has granted an exemption in writing for an appropriate reason.
          
          
            § 386.13

            § 388.1
            Purpose.
            This part prescribes regulations implementing the provisions of Title V of Public Law 105-383 (112 Stat. 3445), which grants the Secretary authority to review and approve applications for waiver of the coastwise trade laws to allow the carriage of no more than twelve passengers for hire on vessels, which are three years old or more, built or rebuilt outside the United States, and grants authority for revocation of those waivers.
          
          
            § 388.2
            Definitions.
            For the purposes of this part:

            (c) Eligible Vessel means a vessel that—is either a small passenger vessel or an uninspected passenger vessel that—
            (1) Was not built in the United States and is at least 3 years of age; or
            (2) If rebuilt, was rebuilt outside the United States at least 3 years before the certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement if granted, would become effective.
            (d) MARAD means the Maritime Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation.
            (e) Secretary means the Secretary of Transportation.

            [69 FR 51772, Aug. 23, 2004, as amended at 75 FR 28206, May 20, 2010]
          
          
            § 388.3
            Application and fee.

            (a) An owner of a vessel may choose either of two methods to apply for an administrative waiver of the coastwise trade laws of the United States for an eligible vessel to carry no more than twelve passengers for hire.

            (1) The application form contained on MARAD's Web site at http://www.marad.dot.gov may be submitted electronically with credit card or Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) payment of the $500 application fee.
            (2) Alternatively, applicants may send written applications to Small Passenger Vessel Waiver Applications, Office of Cargo Preference, MAR-730, 1200 New Jersey Ave., SE., Washington, DC 20590. Written applications need not be in any particular format, but must be signed, be accompanied by a check made out to the order of “Maritime Administration,” and contain the following information:
            (i) Name of vessel and owner for which waiver is requested and the vessel's official number.
            (ii) Size, capacity and tonnage of vessel (state whether tonnage is measured pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 14502, or otherwise, and if otherwise, how measured).
            (iii) Intended use for vessel, including geographic region of intended operation and trade.
            (iv) Date and place of construction and (if applicable) rebuilding. (If applicant is unable to document the origin of the vessel, foreign construction will be assumed).
            (v) Name, address, and telephone number of the vessel owner.
            (vi) A statement on the impact this waiver will have on other commercial passenger vessel operators, including a statement describing the operations of existing operators.
            (vii) A statement on the impact this waiver will have on U.S. shipyards.
            (viii) A statement that the applicant represents that the foregoing information is true to the best of the applicant's knowledge.
            (b) MARAD may ask additional questions of the applicant as part of the application review.
            [69 FR 51772, Aug. 23, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 66797, Nov. 3, 2005; 75 FR 28206, May 20, 2010]
          
          
            § 388.4
            Criteria for grant of a waiver.
            (a) General Criteria. (1) A waiver of the foreign build and/or foreign rebuild prohibition in the coastwise trade laws will be granted for an eligible vessel only if we determine that the employment of the vessel in the coastwise trade will not unduly adversely affect—
            (i) United States vessel builders; or
            (ii) The coastwise trade business of any person who employs vessels built in the United States in that business.
            (2) The determination of “unduly adverse affect” on a coastwise operator or a U.S. vessel builder may not be limited to operators or builders of vessels carrying 12 or fewer passengers.
            (3) We may evaluate the expected impact of the proposed waiver on the basis of the information received from all sources, including public comment, internal investigation and analysis, and any other sources of information deemed appropriate.
            (b) Impact on U.S. vessel builders. We may use the following criteria to determine the effect on U.S. vessel builders: Whether a potentially affected U.S. vessel builder has a history of construction of similar vessels, or can demonstrate the capability and capacity and the fact it has taken definite steps to offer to build a similar vessel, for use in the same geographic region of the United States, as the proposed vessel of the applicant.
            (c) Impact on coastwise trade business. We may use the following criteria to determine the effect on existing operators of U.S.-built vessels in coastwise trade:
            (1) Whether the proposed vessel of the applicant and a vessel of an existing operator (or the vessel of an operator that can demonstrate it has taken definite steps to begin operation) would provide similar commercial service and would operate in the same geographic area.
            (2) The number of similar vessels operating or proposed to operate in the same market with the same or similar itinerary, relative to the size of the market. For example, a single vessel may have a small impact on a large market.
            (d) Advance notice and approval needed for changes. When we approve a waiver application, we will notify the applicant that no substantial change in the employment of the vessel in the coastwise trade may be made without prior notice to MARAD. In general, a substantial change in operating area will require a new waiver application.
          
          
            § 388.5
            Criteria for revocation of a waiver.
            We shall revoke a waiver previously granted under this part if we determine, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that fraud was involved in any part of the waiver application.
          
          
            § 388.6
            Process.
            (a) Initial process. (1) We will review each application for completeness as received. We will notify the applicant if additional information is necessary or if the application does not meet the initial eligibility requirements for waiver. All applications will be available for public inspection electronically in the Department of Transportation Docket at http://dot.dms.gov.
            

            (2) Applications being processed on the merits will be noticed in the Federal Register. Interested parties will be given an opportunity to comment on whether introduction of any proposed vessel would adversely affect them. In the absence of duly filed objections to an application, and in the absence of unduly adverse impact on vessel builders or businesses employing U.S.-built vessels otherwise discovered by us, we will conclude that there will be no adverse effect. If an objection to an application is received, additional information may be sought from the objector. The applicant will be given a sufficient amount of time to respond. The Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, will then either make a decision based on the written submissions and all available information or, on MARAD's motion or at the applicant's request, hold a hearing on the application and make a decision based on the hearing record. The decision will be communicated to the applicant, commenters and the United States Coast Guard in writing and placed in the docket. If MARAD grants a waiver, the applicant must thereafter contact the Coast Guard to obtain the necessary documentation for domestic operation. MARAD's waiver does not satisfy other requirements of the Coast Guard for documentation. The waiver, if approved, will be assigned to the vessel.
            (b) Revocation. We may, upon the request of a U.S. builder or a coastwise trade business of a person who employs U.S.-built vessels or upon our own initiative propose to revoke a waiver granted under this part, on the basis that the waiver was obtained through fraud. The grantee of the waiver in question will be notified directly by mail, and a notice will be published in the Federal Register. The original docket of the application will be reopened. We may request additional information from the applicant granted the waiver or from any respondent to the notice. The Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, will then either make a decision based on the written submissions and all available information or, on MARAD's motion or at the applicant's request, hold a hearing on the proposed revocation and make a decision based on the hearing record. The decision will be communicated in writing to: the applicant granted the waiver, the requestor (if any), each respondent to the proposed revocation notice, the Coast Guard; and placed in the docket. If MARAD revokes a waiver, the Coast Guard, automatically and without further proceedings, shall revoke the vessel's coastwise endorsement.
            (c) Review of determinations. (1) The decisions by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, to grant a waiver, deny a waiver, or revoke a waiver will not be final until time for discretionary review by the Administrator has expired. Each decision to grant, deny, or revoke a waiver will be made in writing and a copy of the written decision will be provided to each applicant and other parties to the decision. Applicants, persons who requested revocation of a waiver, and persons who submitted comments in response to a Federal Register notice may petition the Administrator to review a decision by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, to grant a waiver, deny a waiver, or revoke a waiver within five (5) business days after such decision is filed in the docket. Each petition for review should state the petitioner's standing and the reasons review is being sought, clearly pointing out alleged errors of fact or misapplied points of law. Within five (5) business days of submission of a petition for review, the applicant, and other persons with standing, may request that the Administrator not review a decision by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, to grant, deny, or revoke a waiver. Such petitions and responses must either be sent by facsimile to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, at (202) 366-9206 or filed electronically in the appropriate DOT docket at http://dms.dot.gov. The Administrator will decide whether to review within five (5) business days following the last day for submission of a request that the Administrator not take review. If the Administrator undertakes review, the decision by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, is stayed until final disposition. In the event the Administrator decides to undertake review, a decision will be made based on the written submissions and all available information. As a matter of discretion, the Administrator or designated representative may hold a hearing on the proposed action and make a decision based on the hearing record. The decision will be communicated in writing to the interested parties and the Coast Guard. In the review process, the decision of the Maritime Administrator is the final disposition. In the absence of any petition for review, the determination by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, becomes final on the sixth business day after the decision. The Secretary, MARAD, may extend any of the time limits, but only for good cause shown.

            (2) Such petitions and responses must either be sent by facsimile to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, at (202) 366-9206 or filed electronically in the appropriate DOT docket at http://dms.dot.gov. The Administrator will decide whether to review within five (5) business days following the last day for submission of a request that the Administrator not take review. If the Administrator takes review, the decision by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, is stayed until final disposition. In the event the Administrator decides to take review, a decision will be made based on the written submissions and all available information. As a matter of discretion, the Administrator or designated representative may hold a hearing on the proposed action and make a decision based on the hearing record.

In the absence of any petition for review, the determination by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, becomes final on the sixth business day after the decision. The Secretary, MARAD, may extend any of the time limits, but only for good cause shown.

            Purpose.

            This part prescribes regulations implementing the provisions of section 417 of Public Law 108-293, which grants the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Maritime Administrator, the authority to review and approve applications for determination of availability of coastwise-qualified vessels. Owners or operators of proposed platform jackets may submit information regarding a specific platform jacket transport, placement and/or launch project, following the procedures set forth in this regulation, in order for the Maritime Administration to determine whether a suitable coastwise-qualified vessel is available for the project. If the agency determines that a project owner has registered as required herein and sought in good faith to meet its transportation needs using U.S. flag vessels in compliance with the Jones Act, and that a suitable coastwise qualified vessel is not available, then a foreign launch barge may be used.
          
          
            § 389.2
            Definitions.
            For the purposes of this part:

            (iii) Share interest in a vessel; the party is considered to have a share interest in an eligible agreement vessel if the party has the right to use the vessel to generate income or a right to the proceeds or a portion of the proceeds from its use even if the party does not have a proprietary interest in the vessel for purposes of State or Federal law.
            (3) Foreign or domestic commerce. For the purpose of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section the term foreign or domestic commerce means the water-borne carriage of men, materials, goods or wares between:

            (c) Qualified agreement vessels—(1) Definition. A qualified agreement vessel which may be acquired, constructed or reconstructed with the aid of qualified withdrawals, is any vessel:

            (i) Constructed in the United States, and if reconstructed, reconstructed in the United States; the term constructed or reconstructed in the United States includes any vessel which was constructed or reconstructed outside of the United States but documented under the laws of the United States on April 15, 1970, or constructed or reconstructed outside of the United States for use in the United States foreign commerce pursuant to a contract entered into before April 15, 1970;
            (ii) Documented under the laws of the United States;

            (ii) Use of barges as docks and ramps;
            (iii) Except as provided in (c)(8) (i) and (ii) of this section:
            (A) Foreign-to-foreign trade, consisting of voyages originating and ending in foreign ports, with no intermediate domestic cargo operation, and

            § 390.6
            Administration of the agreement.
            (a) In general. The Maritime Administrator will administer and enforce the agreement in a manner which will insure that the fund is properly established, that the assets in the fund are used to accomplish the program and that the party fully complies with all obligations and responsibilities. This section specifies the reports which must be submitted to the Maritime Administrator and sets forth the procedures for administering the agreement.
            (b) Reporting requirements—(1) In general. This paragraph describes the reports required to be submitted to the Maritime Administrator by the party.
            (2) Submission dates. Reports must be submitted annually, in triplicate, for the party's taxable year not later than 90 days after the close of each reporting period. An affidavit regarding the operation of qualified agreement vessels as required by paragraph (b)(7) of this section shall be submitted concurrently with each annual report.
            (3) Cumulation. The annual report submitted following the close of the party's taxable year shall be cumulative for the party's entire taxable year.
            (4) Certification. The annual report shall be accompanied by an opinion of an independent certified public accountant to the effect that exhibits (see paragraph (b)(5) of this section) composing the accounting have been prepared in accordance with all published orders, rules, regulations and instructions issued or adopted by the Maritime Administrator.
            (5) Format. The reports shall consist of the following exhibits:
            (i) “Exhibit A”—a summary of cash, securities and stock on deposit (showing the adjusted basis for securities and stock), including a subtotal of cash, securities and stock on deposit, net amount of accrued deposits to and accrued withdrawals from the fund and the fund total at the end of the period, and if applicable, a summary of the portion of the fund which represents a “CCF: Security Amount” pursuant to an Agreement Covering the Dual Use of a Capital Construction Fund;
            (ii) “Exhibit A-1”—a summary of balances in all cash accounts within the fund at the end of the period;
            (iii) “Exhibit A-2”—a summary of the securities and stock within the fund at the end of the period (showing both the adjusted basis and fair market value of each item);
            (iv) “Exhibit A-3”—a summary of the accrued deposits to and accrued withdrawals from the fund at the end of the period;
            (v) “Exhibit B”—a transcript of transactions occurring within the fund during the period by date;
            (vi) “Exhibit C”—a summary showing the opening balance, additions thereto due to deposits to the fund, subtractions therefrom due to withdrawals from the fund, and the closing balance for the period for each of the three separate accounts: ordinary income account, capital gains account and capital account; and
            (vii) “Exhibit D”—a summary, by vessel, of the qualified withdrawals made from the fund during the period.
            (6) Sample report. A sample report is contained in appendix III of this part.
            (7) Affidavit. An official of the party who is knowledgeable about the operation of the party's qualified agreement vessels shall submit an affidavit for each taxable year indicating that the party's qualified agreement vessels operated only in qualified trades during such taxable year, or if any such vessel operated in a trade other than a qualified trade, the details of such operation. See § 390.5(c) of this part for a description of what constitutes a qualified trade. A sample affidavit is contained in appendix V of this part.
            (8) Failure to submit reports. The failure by a party to make the timely submission of any report or affidavit required by this section shall constitute a material breach of the agreement unless the Maritime Administrator shall determine that such failure was excusable. See § 390.13 (relating to the failure to fulfill a substantial obligation under the agreement).
            (c) Review in the event of changed circumstances. Each agreement provides that the party shall promptly inform the Maritime Administrator of any change in circumstances which affects its agreement. Such changes may be mere form, such as a change of the party's name, or substantive such as the sale of an eligible agreement vessel. The Maritime Administrator may require a full review of the agreement if in his opinion the changed circumstances materially affect the agreement.
            (d) Modification of agreement—(1) In general. The agreement is subject to modification and amendment by mutual consent. However, except in special circumstances, the Maritime Administrator will not consent to modification or amendment of the standard part of the agreement unless such modification or amendment is of uniform application to similarly situated parties. The Maritime Administrator will normally agree to modification or amendment of the schedules subject to the restriction in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
            (2) Limitations on modification of schedules. The Maritime Administrator will not agree to modification or amendment of the schedules (as described in § 390.4) when, in his opinion, such modification or amendment delays imposition of Federal Income Tax in a manner not contemplated or authorized by the Act, or if the proposed modification or amendment would not be in consonance with the policies of the Act, these rules and regulations or the joint regulations.
            (e) Fund adjustment upon modification. Upon application by a party for modification or amendment of the agreement, the Maritime Administrator will determine whether the requested modification or amendment would result in an amount held in the fund in excess of an amount determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the program. If such an excess is created in the fund by such modification or amendment, the Maritime Administrator will require a nonqualified withdrawal (as defined in § 390.10) of such excess as a condition to the modification or amendment.
            [41 FR 4265, Jan. 29, 1976, as amended at 41 FR 39751, Sept. 16, 1976; 55 FR 34928, Aug. 27, 1990]
          
          
            § 390.7
            Deposits into the fund.
            (a) In general—(1) Source of deposits. 46 U.S.C. 53505 provides ceilings within which fund deposits may be made. This section provides rules for the qualification of depositories, timing of deposits, the type of property which may be deposited and the level of deposits.
            (2) Tax aspects of deposits. For the Federal Income Tax aspects of deposits into a fund, see 46 U.S.C. 53507 and § 3.3 of the joint regulations (§ 391.3 of this chapter).
            (b) Depositories—(1) In general. 46 U.S.C. 53506 provides that amounts in a fund must be kept in the depository or depositories specified in the agreement and be subject to such trustee or other fiduciary requirements as the Maritime Administrator may specify.
            (2) Qualifications. The Maritime Administrator has established general qualifications for depositories for all maritime programs authorized under the Act, including the capital construction fund program. The general qualifications are published in part 351 of this title.
            (3) Fiduciary requirements. Except in unusual circumstances, the Maritime Administrator will not impose special trustee or other fiduciary requirements upon depositories of a fund. For rules relating to a fund held in trust for investment purposes, see paragraph (h) of this section.
            (4) Type and name of accounts. Unless otherwise specified in the agreement, the party may select the type or types of accounts in which assets of the fund may be deposited. For example, the party may select a savings account for cash and a trust account for intangible property which is held in the fund. Each account shall be in the name of the party and identified as a capital construction fund account.
            (5) Compensating balances. The obligation of the assets in the fund as a compensating balance shall constitute a material breach of the agreement.
            (c) Timing of deposits—(1) In general. 46 U.S.C. 53507(b) provides that deposits shall not be taxable only when they are made in accordance with the agreement and not later than the time provided in the joint regulations.
            (2) Deposits prior to the time provided in joint regulations. The party may make deposits for any taxable year prior to the time provided in joint regulations in accordance with the following rules:

            (i) Amounts representing taxable income attributable to the operation of agreement vessels for a taxable year may be deposited at any time during such taxable year, and thereafter within the time provided for in the joint regulations, based upon the party's estimated Federal taxable income for such vessels for the entire taxable year;
            
            (ii) Amounts representing net proceeds from the sale or other disposition (including mortgaging) with respect to agreement vessels may be deposited when accrued and thereafter within the time provided for in the joint regulations;
            (iii) Amounts representing receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in a fund may be deposited when accrued and thereafter within the time provided for in the joint regulations; and
            (iv) Amounts representing depreciation with respect to agreement vessels for a taxable year may be deposited at any time during such taxable year, and thereafter within the time provided for in the joint regulations.
            (3) Deposits required prior to the time provided in joint regulations. The Maritime Administrator may require that deposits be made earlier than the latest time provided for in the joint regulations. Generally, the Maritime Administrator will require early deposits only when necessary for the party to meet its agreed upon obligations.
            (d) Types of property which may be deposited into a fund—(1) Form of deposits. Deposits may be made into a fund only in the form of money or intangible property of the type in which assets of the fund may be invested pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 53506, the Agreement, and these regulations, other than the securities or common and preferred stock of the party or a company related to the party within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, except that in the case of deposits representing net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any agreement vessel to other than a purchaser or transferee related to the party (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section) or deposits representing receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in a fund, any intangible property received may be deposited.
            (2) Related purchaser. For purposes of this paragraph a purchaser or transferee is a related person to the party if—
            (i) The relationship between purchaser or transferee and the party would result in disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707 of the Code, or
            (ii) The purchaser or transferee and the party are members of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 1563(a) of the Code, except that “more than 50 percent” shall be substituted for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears therein).
            (e) Level of deposits—(1) In general. 46 U.S.C. 53504 states that the agreement must provide for the deposit in the fund of amounts agreed upon but only to the extent necessary or appropriate to provide for qualified withdrawals to accomplish the program set forth in the agreement.
            (2) Maximum level of deposits. The party shall not be permitted to deposit more than is necessary to complete its program. See § 390.4 (relating to description of the agreement).
            (3) Minimum level of deposits. Each agreement shall contain an agreed upon minimum deposit schedule applicable to each three-year period under the agreement. The minimum deposit shall be calculated taking into consideration the scheduling of the anticipated qualified withdrawals. The purpose of the minimum deposit is to insure that the party has made a sufficient commitment to accomplish its program. See § 390.13 (relating to failure to fulfill a substantial obligation under the agreement).
            (4) Determination of minimum deposits. The minimum deposit shall be set by the Maritime Administrator. In determining the minimum deposit, the Maritime Administrator shall give consideration to the anticipated ceilings, financial history, current conditions and future business expectations of the party.
            (5) Waiver of minimum deposit. The Maritime Administrator shall waive a failure to meet the minimum deposit schedule when the party has deposited all allowable taxable income as specified in Article 5(c) of this agreement attributable to the operation of agreement vessels, net proceeds from all sales or other dispositions of agreement vessels, all receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in the fund and all earned depreciation on agreement vessels. The Maritime Administrator may also waive the minimum deposit schedule in any case where the party can demonstrate that such deposits will adversely affect its ability to operate its agreement vessels. In the event of a waiver, the Maritime Administrator may require modification of the schedules. See § 390.6 (relating to administration of the agreement).
            (6) Selection of ceiling. Except as may be otherwise provided in the agreement or these rules and regulations, the party may choose the ceilings with respect to which deposits are made.
            (f) Allocation of depreciation deposits—(1) In general. 46 U.S.C. 53505(b) provides that in the case of a lessee of an eligible agreement vessel the maximum amount which may be deposited with respect to such vessel, under the depreciation ceiling, shall be reduced by any amount which the owner is required or permitted to deposit with respect to such vessel under its depreciation ceiling.
            (2) Method of allocation. When an agreement vessel is leased, the party's agreement shall fix a percentage of the annual depreciation which the party may deposit. The percentage shall be that agreed upon between the lessors and the lessees unless the Maritime Administrator determines that the agreed upon percentage will result in an accumulation of assets in the fund or funds which is greater than or less than an amount necessary or appropriate to carry out the party's program. See paragraph (e) of this section (relating to level of deposits).
            (g) [Reserved]
            (h) Funds held in trust for investment purposes. A fund may be transferred in whole or in part to the control of an unrelated trustee for investment purposes with the prior written permission of the Maritime Administrator. The Maritime Administrator shall approve such a transfer when:
            (1) The trustee meets the requirements for a depository under paragraph (b) of this section;
            (2) The trust instrument provides that all investment restrictions stated in 46 U.S.C. 53506 and § 390.8 of these regulations will be observed;
            (3) The trust instrument provides that the trustee will give consideration to the party's withdrawal requirements under the agreement when investing the fund;
            (4) The trustee agrees to be bound by all rules and regulations which have been or will be promulgated governing the investment or management of the fund.
            (i) Federal ship mortgage guarantee or insurance. A fund may serve in lieu of a Restricted Fund required in connection with Federal Ship Mortgage Guarantee or Insurance under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 537 and the regulations thereunder upon approval by the Maritime Administrator. Approval by the Maritime Administrator shall be conditioned upon the execution by the party of an agreement, satisfactory in form and substance to the Maritime Administrator, governing the dual use of the fund. Applications for permission to use the fund in this dual capacity should be made in writing to the Secretary, Maritime Administration.

            (ii) Preferred stock of a corporation if the common stock of that corporation meets the requirements of this paragraph and if the preferred stock of such corporation would meet such requirements but for the fact that such preferred stock cannot be listed and registered as required because it is nonvoting stock.

Funds shall not be invested in the interest bearing securities or common and preferred stock of the party or of a company related to the party within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder.
            (5) Subsequent investments. If at any time the fair market value of the interest bearing securities or common and preferred stock in the fund is more than the limitations stated in this paragraph (c), any subsequent deposit to or withdrawal from the fund or investment made within the fund shall be made in such a way as tends to restore the fund to a posture in which the fair market values of such securities or stock do not exceed such limitations. Values of such securities and stocks shall be the fair market values as determined by the party on the last day of each semi-annual and annual reporting period.

            § 390.9
            Qualified withdrawals.
            (a) In general—(1) Defined. In accordance with 46 U.S.C. 53509, qualified withdrawals are those made from a fund in accordance with the agreement, but only if they are for:
            (i) The acquisition, construction or reconstruction of a qualified agreement vessel;
            (ii) The acquisition, construction or reconstruction of barges or containers which are part of the complement of a qualified agreement vessel; or
            (iii) The payment of the principal on indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition, construction or reconstruction of a qualified agreement vessel or a barge or container which is part of the complement of a qualified agreement vessel.
            (2) Tax aspects of a qualified withdrawal. For the tax aspects of a qualified withdrawal, see 46 U.S.C. 50510 and § 3.6 of the joint regulations (§ 391.6 of this chapter).
            (b) Purpose of qualified withdrawals—(1) Acquisition of qualified agreement vessels. (i) The term acquisition of a qualified agreement vessel shall mean any transaction, including a corporate merger, where the party obtains a proprietary interest in an existing vessel and such a proprietary interest will, in the opinion of the Maritime Administrator, further the purposes and policies of the Act. See § 390.3 (relating to policy considerations).
            (ii) Qualified withdrawals for the acquisition of a qualified agreement vessel shall only be allowed for amounts determined by independent appraisal to be the fair market value of the vessel, at the time of the acquisition, or the actual cost directly allocable to acquiring only the vessel, whichever is less.
            (2) Construction of qualified agreement vessels. The term construction of a qualified agreement vessel shall mean the construction of a vessel with the aid of qualified withdrawals.
            (3) Reconstruction of qualified agreement vessels. Once an agreement has been entered into, the term reconstruction of a qualified agreement vessel shall mean any improvement to an existing vessel which increases the vessel's competitiveness and involves an aggregate sum in excess of $100,000. The Maritime Administrator may waive the monetary limit in this subparagraph in the case of small vessels.
            (4) Payment of principal on indebtedness. 46 U.S.C. 53509(a)(2) provides that any indebtedness which the party proposes to pay through qualified withdrawals must be shown to the satisfaction of the Maritime Administrator to have been incurred in direct connection with the acquisition, construction or reconstruction of a qualified agreement vessel. The fact that indebtedness is secured by an interest in a qualified agreement vessel is insufficient by itself to demonstrate the direct connection. It is not necessary that the lien or mortgage securing the indebtedness be on the vessel. For example, if the party mortgages an office building in order to finance the construction of a vessel, payments of principal on the mortgage may be made with qualified withdrawals.
            (c) Limitations on qualified withdrawals—(1) Capitalized costs requirement. All qualified withdrawals must be for costs which are capitalized under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder and so reported on the party's Federal Income Tax return.
            (2) Executed contract requirement and reimbursement of general funds. Qualified withdrawals may be made for the purpose of reimbursing general funds subject to the following limitations:

            (i) Qualified withdrawals may not be made until a construction, reconstruction or acquisition contract is executed. However, the party may reimburse its general funds for expenditures applicable to the construction, reconstruction or acquisition contract which occurred prior to the date of contracting if such reimbursements are made within 120 days from the date of such contracting.
            
            (ii) The party may also reimburse its general funds for expenditures which could have been paid initially by a qualified withdrawal, if such reimbursements are made within 120 days of such expenditure.
            (iii) The party may reimburse its general funds for expenditures made prior to the time an agreement or amendment is entered into, but after the party has made application therefor, if such expenditures would otherwise qualify for reimbursement pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section but for the fact that an agreement or amendment has not been executed, and if such reimbursement is effected within 120 days of the execution of an agreement or amendment.
            (3) Prepayment of indebtedness. The party shall not prepay principal on indebtedness with qualified withdrawals without the prior written consent of the Maritime Administrator.
            (4) Qualified withdrawals paid to related persons. A withdrawal, including payments for indebtedness, paid to a related person, within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder, shall not constitute a qualified withdrawal unless the Maritime Administrator determines that no portion of such payment constitutes a dividend, a return of capital or a contribution of capital under the Internal Revenue Code. Transactions which include payments to a related person, will be approved if the cost of the item to be acquired, constructed or reconstructed through qualified withdrawals is or was at the time of the acquisition, construction or reconstruction its fair market value. The party must obtain the prior written permission of the Maritime Administrator before any qualified withdrawals may be paid to a related person. Any such withdrawal prior to approval shall be a nonqualified withdrawal.
            (d) Permission to make qualified withdrawals. Once a program has been approved, prior approval of the Maritime Administrator is not required for specific qualified withdrawals except as provided in paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section. However, the Maritime Administrator will give prior approval to qualified withdrawals upon written request.
            [41 FR 4265, Jan. 29, 1976, as amended at 55 FR 34929, Aug. 27, 1990; 73 FR 56740, Sept. 30, 2008]
          
          
            § 390.10
            Nonqualified withdrawals.
            (a) In general—(1) Defined. Any withdrawal from a fund which is not a qualified withdrawal is a nonqualified withdrawal.
            (2) Tax aspects of a nonqualified withdrawal. For the tax aspects of a nonqualified withdrawal, see 46 U.S.C. 53511 and § 3.7 of the joint regulations (§ 391.7 of this chapter).
            (b) Permission required—(1) In general. The prior written permission of the Maritime Administrator is required before a nonqualified withdrawal may be made.
            (2) Failure to secure permission. A nonqualified withdrawal made without the prior written permission of the Maritime Administrator shall constitute a material breach of the agreement unless the Maritime Administrator shall determine that failure to obtain prior written consent was excusable. See § 390.13 (relating to failure to fulfill a substantial obligation under the agreement).
            (3) Types of nonqualified withdrawals which will be permitted. Generally, the Maritime Administrator will give permission to make nonqualified withdrawals when:
            (i) The party has incurred operating losses from the operations of agreement vessels which have impaired his working capital and it becomes necessary to reimburse its general funds to the extent of such losses;
            (ii) The party desires to make an expenditure for research, development or design and such an expenditure is incident to new and advanced ship design, machinery and equipment;
            (iii) The withdrawal would be a qualified withdrawal except for the fact that there is no tax basis left that can be reduced; or

            (iv) The party demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Maritime Administrator, that it cannot fulfill its program due to circumstances beyond its control or due to a change in circumstances which makes the completion of its program economically unfeasible.
            [41 FR 4265, Jan. 29, 1976, as amended at 73 FR 56740, Sept. 30, 2008]
          
          
            § 390.11
            Sale or other disposition of agreement vessels.
            (a) Eligible agreement vessels. The sale or other disposition (including mortgages) of eligible agreement vessels shall not require prior approval of the Maritime Administrator, but shall require written notification within 10 days after the sale or other disposition. Such notification shall include a description of the transaction, the identity of the transferee, the proceeds to be realized, the date of the transaction and whether the proceeds will be deposited into the fund.
            (b) Qualified agreement vessels—(1) In general. If a qualified agreement vessel whose basis has been reduced through the application of qualified withdrawals is sold or disposed of (including mortgaged) within one year, interest on the amount of gain attributable to the basis reduction shall attach if the Maritime Administrator determines that the disposition was contrary to the policies of the Act, the joint regulations or these regulations. See § 390.13 (relating to failure to fulfill a substantial obligation under the agreement).
            (2) Period of one year defined. The one-year period shall mean 365 days from the date of final delivery from the shipyard in the case of construction or reconstruction and 365 days from the date of first loading of the vessel in the case of an acquisition.
            (3) Prior approval. The party shall obtain the written approval of the Maritime Administrator prior to the sale or other disposition (including mortgage) of a qualified agreement vessel.
            (4) Deposit requirement. The Maritime Administrator will not normally require the deposit of the net proceeds from the sale of a qualified agreement vessel but shall require the deposit of the net proceeds from the mortgage of a qualified agreement vessel for which qualified withdrawals from the fund have been made.
            (c) Sale or other disposition of agreement vessels to related persons—(1) In general. Section 3.2(c)(4) of the joint regulations (§ 391.2(c)(4) of this chapter) requires that the net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of an agreement vessel shall be the fair market value of the vessel when the party and the purchaser are owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder. In such case, the party shall furnish data to establish that the amount realized or to be realized is the fair market value.
            (2) Data to be submitted. Sufficient data must be submitted to support a determination by the Maritime Administrator of the fair market value including the original cost of the vessel, dates of original delivery, acquisition and reconstruction, as applicable, cost of improvements, sales price, costs of sale and any other information which would assist in making such determination.

            § 390.12
            Liquidated damages.
            (a) Liquidated damages—(1) In general. Each agreement entered into under Chapter 535 shall contain a liquidated damages provision for the purpose of placing the party into its prefund position for each day a qualified agreement vessel is operated in violation of the geographic trading restrictions contained in the Act and § 390.5. The liquidated damages provision requires that the party repay the time value of the deferral of Federal Income Tax which the party has received.
            (2) Calculation of liquidated damages. The liquidated damages specified in this paragraph shall be calculated as follows:

            (i) With respect to each vessel operated in violation of the applicable trading restrictions, add (A) the sum of qualified withdrawals for the vessel which have been made from the ordinary income and capital gain accounts to the date of breach, and (B) the amount of any unpaid principal on indebtedness for the vessel which may be paid from the fund less any portion of such amount which by operation of law must be withdrawn from the capital account balance on deposit in the fund on the date of the breach.
            (ii) Multiply the total derived in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section by an assumed effective Federal Income Tax rate of 30 percent;
            (iii) Compound the product derived in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section at 8 percent annually (A) for 20 years, if the duration of the trading restrictions applicable to the vessel is 20 years in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; (B) for 10 years, if the duration of the trading restrictions applicable to the vessel is 10 years in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section; or (C) for 5 years, if the duration of the trading restrictions applicable to the vessel is 5 years in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section.
            (iv) Subtract the amount calculated in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section from the product derived in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section;
            (v) Divide the result derived in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section by 2; and
            (vi) Divide the result derived in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section (A) by 7300 (days) if the duration of the trading restrictions applicable to the vessel is 20 years; (B) by 3650 (days) if the duration of the trading restrictions applicable to the vessel is 10 years; or (C) by 1825 (days) if the duration of the trading restrictions applicable to the vessel is 5 years.
            (3) Formula. The calculation of the daily rate of liquidated damages may be reduced to the following formula:
            
            
              X = [I(QT)−S]/2D
            
            
            
              Where:
              
              
                X = Daily rate in dollars.
              
                Q = Summation of qualified withdrawals, other than withdrawals from the capital account, permitted from the fund.
              
                T = Assumed effective tax rate of 30 pct.
              
                S = Tax savings = (Q)(T).
              
                I = Discount factor to be applied for vessels subject to 20-yr trading restriction = 4.660957; for vessels subject to 10-yr trading restriction = 2.158925; for vessels subject to 5-yr trading restriction = 1.469328 (value of $1 compounded at 8 pct for 20, 10, and 5 yr respectively).
              
                D = 7,300 d for vessels subject to 20-yr trading restriction; 3,650 d for vessels subject to 10-yr trading restriction; 1,825 d for vessel subject to 5-yr trading restriction.
            
            
            The formula may be further reduced to:
            
            
              X = 0.5491436Q/7,300
            
            for vessels subject to 20 year trading restriction,
            
            
              X = 0.1738388Q/3,650
            
            for vessels subject to 10 year trading restriction,
            
            
              X = 0.0703992Q/1,825
            
            for vessels subject to 5 year trading restriction.
            (4) Example. The provisions of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:
            
            

              Assume that a qualified agreement vessel has been constructed with qualified withdrawals from a fund. The total cost was $20 million of which $6 million was withdrawn from the fund for a downpayment. Pursuant to the agreement, an additional $4 million may be withdrawn from the fund to pay principal on indebtedness. Thus, $10 million has been or may be withdrawn from the fund with respect to this vessel. The daily rate of liquidated damages would be:
              
              
                X = 0.5491436 (10,000,000)/7300 or X = $752.25
            
            
            (5) Payment of liquidated damages. The amount derived in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be the daily rate of liquidated damages and shall be paid to the Maritime Administrator, for deposit in the Treasury of the United States, within 30 days from the date the qualified agreement vessel first entered the prohibited geographic trade and shall be for all amounts owing from such date thereafter until the date payment is due. Payments, for continuing breaches, shall be made at 30 day intervals.
            (6) Other remedies. Nothing in this paragraph shall diminish the Maritime Administrator's other remedies for breach under the Act, the rules and regulations or the agreement.
            (b) Duration of restrictions—(1) In general. The geographic trading restrictions in the Act and § 390.5 and the liquidated damages provision shall apply for:

            (i) 20 years from the date of final delivery on qualified agreement vessels constructed or acquired within one year of final delivery from the shipyard with the aid of qualified withdrawals;
            
            (ii) 10 years from the date of completion of reconstruction for qualified agreement vessels reconstructed with the aid of qualified withdrawals;
            (iii) 10 years from the date of acquisition of qualified agreement vessels acquired with the aid of qualified withdrawals more than one year after final delivery of the vessel from the shipyard;
            (iv) 10 years from the date of the first qualified withdrawal from the fund to pay the existing indebtedness on a qualified agreement vessel which was included in Schedule B for that purpose unless the qualified vessel was more than fifteen years old on the date of the first qualified withdrawal in which case the period shall be five years.
            (2) Transfer of qualified agreement vessel. In the event a qualified agreement vessel is sold or transferred to another person (see paragraph (b)(3) of § 390.11 requiring prior permission), the transferor shall require in the bill of sale that the transferee agree with the Maritime Administrator to comply with the geographic trading restrictions and to pay liquidated damages for any breach of such agreement that occurs after the transfer. The transferor shall remain liable for any violations that occurred prior to the approved transfer. However, in the case of a like kind exchange which is governed by section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if the vessel acquired by the party has an economic life equal to or greater than the length of the geographic trading restrictions that remain applicable to the transferred vessel, the acquired vessel shall be deemed to be a qualified agreement vessel and the geographic trading restrictions of the transferred vessel shall attach to the acquired vessel.

            § 390.13
            Failure to fulfill a substantial obligation under the agreement.
            (a) In general. 46 U.S.C. 53509(c) requires the Maritime Administrator to determine whether there has been a failure to fulfill a substantial obligation under an agreement.
            (b) Contracting Officer's tentative conclusion—(1) Notice. If the Contracting Officer tentatively concludes that any substantial obligation under the agreement, the joint regulations or these regulations is not being fulfilled by the party he shall serve written notice of his tentative conclusion upon the party by certified mail with return receipt requested. The notice shall contain the following information:
            (i) A statement of the grounds upon which the tentative conclusion is based;
            (ii) The amount the Contracting Officer tentatively concludes should be withdrawn as a nonqualified withdrawal; and
            (iii) A statement that the tentative conclusion shall become a final decision unless the party requests, within 30 days, an opportunity either to cure its breach or to be heard and offer evidence in opposition to the tentative conclusion.
            (2) Effect of notice. The notice of the tentative conclusion shall become a final decision as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, unless within 30 days of receipt of such a written notice the party by personal delivery or by certified mail, requests the opportunity either to cure its breach or to be heard and offer evidence in opposition to the tentative conclusion, in which case no further withdrawals from the fund, without the written prior approval of the Contracting Officer, shall be made by the party until a binding final decision is reached by the Maritime Administration.
            (c) Basis for Contracting Officer's tentative conclusion. In determining whether a party has not fulfilled a substantial obligation under its agreement, the Contracting Officer shall consider among other things:
            (1) The effect of the party's action or omission upon its ability to either carry out the purpose of the fund, accomplish its Schedule B program (see § 390.4(c)) or satisfy its minimum level of deposits in Schedule D (see § 390.4(e)).

            (2) Whether the party has made material misrepresentations in connection with its application, agreement or any modification or amendment thereto or has failed to disclose material information that may affect its agreement or the purpose of the fund.
            
            (d) Contracting Officer's decision and appeals to the Maritime Administrator—(1) Where there has not been a request to cure or to be heard. If the Contracting Officer issues a written notice under paragraph (b) of this section and the party does not request within 30 days an opportunity either to cure its breach or to be heard and offer evidence in opposition to the tentative conclusion, the Contracting Officer's tentative conclusion shall become the final decision, which decision shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the party, and no appeal therefrom shall be taken to the Maritime Administrator.
            (2) Where there has been a request to cure or to be heard. If the Contracting Officer issues a written notice under paragraph (b) of this section and the party requests within 30 days an opportunity either to cure its breach or to be heard and offer evidence in opposition to the tentative conclusion, the party shall be offered such an opportunity. Request to cure must include a proposal to cure the breach. If the Contracting Officer accepts the party's proposal to cure its breach, then such determination shall be final. A party requesting to be heard and offer evidence in opposition to the Contracting Officer's tentative conclusion shall be permitted to submit, in writing, any information, evidence or argument within a period set by the Contracting Officer after considering the wishes of the party. The Contracting Officer shall reduce his final decision to writing and furnish the party a copy, by certified mail—return receipt requested, which decision shall be final and conclusive and shall bind the party unless within 30 days of receipt of the decision the party appeals from said decision by personal delivery or by certified mail to the Maritime Administrator with notice to the Contracting Officer.
            (e) Appeals to the Maritime Administrator. Appeals with a request for a hearing on the record, if desired, are to be transmitted pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section and are to be addressed to the Maritime Administrator. Upon the filing of an appeal, the Contracting Officer shall transmit the entire record and a copy of his final decision to the Maritime Administrator. If a request for a hearing on the record is granted, the Maritime Administrator shall proceed pursuant to the Rules of Practice and Procedure in part 201 of this title. The decision of the Maritime Administrator on any question of fact shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the party unless determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be fraudulent, capricious, or arbitrary, or so grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith or is not supported by substantial evidence.

The Party agrees that, each year, within thirty (30) days after the annual meeting of its stockholders, it shall file a supplemental affidavit as evidence of its continuing United States citizenship, provided that any changes in data last furnished with respect to officers, directors, and stockholders holding five percent or more of the issued and outstanding stock of each class or series which would result in a loss of the Party's status as a United States citizen shall be promptly reported to the Maritime Administrator.
            (B) The Party owns, is the lessee, or has contracted for the construction of one or more eligible vessels (within the meaning of 46 U.S.C. 53501) as listed in Schedule A hereof.

            (D) The Party will meet its deposit obligations as agreed upon in Article 5 of this Agreement.
            (E) The Party will promptly inform the Maritime Administrator, in writing, of any change in circumstances which would tend to adversely affect the ability of the Party to carry out its obligations under the Agreement.
            (F) The Party will faithfully conform to all rules and regulations governing the Agreement and the Fund.
            (G) Nothing of monetary value has been improperly given, promised, or implied for entering into this Agreement. The Party further warrants that no improper personal, political or other activities have been used or attempted in an effort to influence the outcome of the discussions or negotiations leading to the award of this Agreement. Breach of this warranty shall constitute an event of default for which the Maritime Administrator shall have the right, notwithstanding Article 4, to terminate this Agreement without liability to the United States.
            14. Default in Obligations: (A) If the Maritime Administrator determines that any substantial obligation under this Agreement is not being fulfilled by the Party, he may, under the rules and regulations and after the Party has been given notice and an opportunity to be heard, declare a breach and treat the entire Fund, or any portion thereof, as an amount withdrawn in a nonqualified withdrawal.
            
            (B) The Maritime Administrator shall provide an opportunity for the Party to cure a breach declared pursuant to Paragraph (A) of this Article 14.

            (6) Any material misrepresentation made by the Party or any failure by the Party to disclose material information in connection with this Agreement whether before or after execution hereof and whether made in an application, report, affidavit, or otherwise; or

            (7) Failure by the Party to comply with any provisions of 46 U.S.C. 53501 et seq, the rules and regulations, or this Agreement.
            15. Extension of Federal Income Tax Benefits: The Maritime Administrator agrees that the Federal income tax benefits provided in the Act and the rules and regulations shall be available to the Party if the Party shall carry out its obligations under this Agreement.

                Sec. 607 (a) Agreement Rules.
              Any citizen of the United States owning or leasing one or more eligible vessels (as defined in subsection (k)(1)) may enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Transportation under, and as provided in, this section to establish a capital construction fund (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “fund”) with respect to any or all of such vessels. Any agreement entered into under this section shall be for the purpose of providing replacement vessels, additional vessels, or reconstructed vessels, built in the United States and documented under the laws of the United States for operation in the United States foreign, Great Lakes, or noncontiguous domestic trade or in the fisheries of the United States and shall provide for the deposit in the fund of the amounts agreed upon as necessary or appropriate to provide for qualified withdrawals under subsection (f). The deposits in the fund, and all withdrawals from the fund, whether qualified or nonqualified, shall be subject to such conditions and requirements as the Secretary of Transportation may by regulations prescribe or are set forth in such agreement; except that the Secretary of Transportation may not require any person to deposit in the fund for any taxable year more than 50 percent of that portion of such person's taxable income for such year (computed in the manner provided in subsection (b)(1)(A)) which is attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels.
              (b) Ceiling on Deposits.
              (1) The amount deposited under subsection (a) in the fund for any taxable year shall not exceed the sum of:
              (A) That portion of the taxable income of the owner or lessee for such year (computed as provided in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 but without regard to the carryback of any net operating loss or net capital loss and without regard to this section) which is attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States or in the fisheries of the United States.
              (B) The amount allowable as a deduction under section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for such year with respect to the agreement vessels.
              (C) If the transaction is not taken into account for purposes of subparagraph (A), the net proceeds (as defined in joint regulations) from (i) the sale or other disposition of any agreement vessel, or (ii) insurance or indemnity attributable to any agreement vessel, and
              (D) The receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in such fund.
              (2) In the case of a lessee, the maximum amount which may be deposited with respect to an agreement vessel by reason of paragraph (1)(B) for any period shall be reduced by any amount which, under an agreement entered into under this section, the owner is required or permitted to deposit for such period with respect to such vessel by reason of paragraph (1)(B).
              (3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term agreement vessel includes barges and containers which are part of the complement of such vessel and which are provided for in the agreement.
              (c) Requirements as to Investments.

              Amounts in any fund established under this section shall be kept in the depository or depositories specified in the agreement and shall be subject to such trustee and other fiduciary requirements as may be specified by the Secretary of Transportation. They may be invested only in interest-bearing securities approved by the Secretary of Transportation; except that, if the Secretary of Transportation consents thereto, an agreed percentage (not in excess of 60 percent) of the assets of the fund may be invested in the stock of domestic corporations. Such stock must be currently fully listed and registered on an exchange registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange, and must be stock which would be acquired by prudent men of discretion and intelligence in such matters who are seeking a reasonable income and the preservation of their capital. If at any time the fair market value of the stock in the fund is more than the agreed percentage of the assets in the fund, any subsequent investment of amounts deposited in the fund, and any subsequent withdrawal from the fund, shall be made in such a way as to tend to restore the fund to a situation in which the fair market value of the stock does not exceed such agreed percentage. For purposes of this subsection, if the common stock of a corporation meets the requirements of this subsection, and if the preferred stock of such corporation would meet such requirements but for the fact that it cannot be listed and registered as required because it is nonvoting stock, such preferred stock shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this subsection.
              (d) Nontaxability for Deposits.
              (1) For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954—
              (A) Taxable income (determined without regard to this section) for the taxable year shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount deposited for the taxable year out of amounts referred to in subsection (b)(1)(A).
              (B) Gain from a transaction referred to in subsection (b)(1)(C) shall not be taken into account if an amount equal to the net proceeds (as defined in joint regulations) from such transaction is deposited in the fund.
              (C) The earnings (including gains and losses) from the investment and reinvestment of amounts held in the fund shall not be taken into account,
              (D) The earnings and profits of any corporation (within the meaning of section 316 of such Code) shall be determined without regard to this section, and
              (E) In applying the tax imposed by section 531 of such Code (relating to the accumulated earnings tax), amounts while held in the fund shall not be taken into account.
              (2) Paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to any amount only if such amount is deposited in the fund pursuant to the agreement and not later than the time provided in joint regulations.
              (e) Establishment of Accounts.
              For purposes of this section—

              (A) The capital account,
              (B) The capital gain account, and
              (C) The ordinary income account.
              (2) The capital account shall consist of—
              (A) Amounts referred to in subsection (b)(1)(B),
              (B) Amounts referred to in subsection (b)(1)(C) other than that portion thereof which represents gain not taken into account by reason of subsection (d)(1)(B),
              (C) 85 percent of any dividend received by the fund with respect to which the person maintaining the fund would (but for subsection (d)(1)(C)) be allowed a deduction under section 243 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and
              (D) Interest income exempt from taxation under section 103 of such Code.
              (3) The capital gain account shall consist of—
              (A) Amounts representing capital gains on assets held for more than 6 months and referred to in subsection (b)(1)(C) or (b)(1)(D), reduced by—
              (B) Amounts representing capital losses on assets held in the fund for more than 6 months.
              (4) The ordinary income account shall consist of—
              (A) Amounts referred to in subsection (b)(1)(A),
              (B)(i) Amounts representing capital gains on assets held for 6 months or less and referred to in subsection (b)(1)(C) or (b)(1)(D), reduced by—

              (C) Interest (not including any tax-exempt interest referred to in paragraph (2)(D)) and other ordinary income (not including any dividend referred to in subparagraph (E)) received on assets held in the fund,
              (D) Ordinary income from a transaction described in subsection (b)(1)(C), and
              (E) 15 percent of any dividend referred to in paragraph (2)(C).
              (5) Except on termination of a fund, capital losses referred to in paragraph (3)(B) or in paragraph (4)(B)(ii) shall be allowed only as an offset to gains referred to in paragraph (3)(A) or (4)(B)(i), respectively.
              (f) Purposes of Qualified Withdrawals.
              (1) A qualified withdrawal from the fund is one made in accordance with the terms of the agreement but only if it is for:
              (A) The acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel,
              (B) The acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of barges and containers which are part of the complement of a qualified vessel, or

              (C) The payment of the principal on indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition, construction or reconstruction of a qualified vessel or a barge or container which is part of the complement of a qualified vessel.
              
              Except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation, subparagraph (B), and so much of subparagraph (C) as relates only to barges and containers, shall apply only with respect to barges and containers constructed in the United States.
              (2) Under joint regulations, if the Secretary of Transportation determines that any substantial obligation under any agreement is not being fulfilled, he may, after notice and opportunity for hearing to the person maintaining the fund, treat the entire fund or any portion thereof as an amount withdrawn from the fund in a nonqualified withdrawal.
              (g) Tax Treatment of Qualified Withdrawals.
              (1) Any qualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated—
              (A) First as made out of the capital account.
              (B) Second as made out of the capital gain account, and
              (C) Third as made out of the ordinary income account.
              (2) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for a vessel, barge, or container is made out of the ordinary income account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container shall be reduced by an amount equal to such portion.
              (3) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for a vessel, barge, or container is made out of the capital gain account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container shall be reduced by an amount equal to—
              (A) Five-eighths of such portion, in the case of a corporation (other than an electing small business corporation, as defined in section 1371 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), or
              (B) One-half of such portion, in the case of any other person.
              (4) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal to pay the principal on any indebtedness is made out of the ordinary income account or the capital gain account, then an amount equal to the aggregate reduction which would be required by paragraphs (2) and (3) if this were a qualified withdrawal for a purpose described in such paragraphs shall be applied, in the order provided in joint regulations, to reduce the basis of vessels, barges, and containers owned by the person maintaining the fund. Any amount of a withdrawal remaining after the application of the preceding sentence shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal.
              (5) If any property the basis of which was reduced under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) is disposed of, any gain realized on such disposition, to the extent it does not exceed the aggregate reduction in the basis of such property under such paragraphs, shall be treated as an amount referred to in subsection (h)(3)(A) which was withdrawn on the date of such disposition. Subject to such conditions and requirements as may be provided in joint regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply to a disposition where there is a redeposit in an amount determined under joint regulations which will insofar as practicable, restore the fund to the position it was in before the withdrawal.
              (h) Tax Treatment of Nonqualified Withdrawals.
              (1) Except as provided in subsection (i), any withdrawal from a fund which is not a qualified withdrawal shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal.
              (2) Any nonqualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated—
              (A) First as be made out of the ordinary income account,
              (B) Second as made out of the capital gain account, and
              (C) Third as made out of the capital account.
              
              For purposes of this section, items withdrawn from any account shall be treated as withdrawn on a first-in-first-out basis; except that (i) any nonqualified withdrawal for research, development, and design expenses incident to new and advanced ship design, machinery and equipment, and (ii) any amount treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under the second sentence of subsection (g)(4), shall be treated as withdrawn on a last-in-first-out basis.
              (3) For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954—
              (A) Any amount referred to in paragraph (2)(A) shall be included in income as an item of ordinary income for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made.
              (B) Any amount referred to in paragraph (2)(B) shall be included in income for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made as an item of gain realized during such year from the disposition of an asset held for more than 6 months, and
              (C) For the period on or before the last date prescribed for payment of tax for the taxable year in which this withdrawal is made—
              (i) No interest shall be payable under section 6601 f such Code and no addition to the tax shall be payable under section 6651 of such Code.
              (ii) Interest on the amount of the additional tax attributable to any item referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be paid at the applicable rate (as defined in paragraph (4)) from the last date prescribed for payment of the tax for the taxable year for which such item was deposited in the fund, and

              (iii) No interest shall be payable on amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (2) or in the case of any nonqualified withdrawal arising from the application of the recapture provision of section 606(5) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 as in effect on December 31, 1969.
              (4) For purposes of paragraph (3)(C)(ii), the applicable rate of interest for any nonqualified withdrawal—
              (A) Made in a taxable year beginning in 1970 or 1971 is 8 percent, or
              (B) Made in a taxable year beginning after 1971, shall be determined and published jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Transportation and shall bear a relationship to 8 percent which the Secretaries determine under joint regulations to be comparable to the relationship which the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year bear to the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year 1970.
              (i) Certain Corporate Reorganizations and Changes in Partnerships.
              Under joint regulations—
              (1) A transfer of a fund from one person to another person in a transaction to which section 381 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies may be treated as if such transaction did not constitute a nonqualified withdrawal, and
              (2) A similar rule shall be applied in the case of a continuation of a partnership (within the meaning of subchapter K of such Code).
              (j) Treatment of Existing Funds.
              (1) Any person who was maintaining a fund or funds (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as “old fund”) under this section (as in effect before the enactment of this subsection) may elect to continue such old fund but—
              (A) May not hold moneys in the old fund beyond the expiration date provided in the agreement under which such old fund is maintained (determined without regard to any extension or renewal entered into after April 14, 1970),
              (B) May not simultaneously maintain such old fund and a new fund established under this section, and
              (C) If he enters into an agreement under this section to establish a new fund, may agree to the extension of such agreement to some or all of the amounts in the old fund.
              (2) In the case of any extension of an agreement pursuant to paragraph (1)(C), each item in the old fund to be transferred shall be transferred in a nontaxable transaction to the appropriate account in the new fund established under this section. For purposes of subsection (h)(3)(C), the date of the deposit of any item so transferred shall be July 1, 1971, or the date of the deposit in the old fund, whichever is the later.

            § 391.1
            Scope of section 607 of the Act and the regulations in this part.
            (a) In general. The regulations prescribed in this part provide rules for determining the income tax liability of any person a party to an agreement with the Secretary of Transportation establishing a capital construction fund (for purposes of this part referred to as the “fund”) authorized by section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (for purposes of this part referred to as the “Act”). With respect to such parties, section 607 of the Act in general provides for the nontaxability of certain deposits of money or other property into the fund out of earnings or gains realized from the operation of vessels covered in an agreement, gains realized from the sale or other disposition of agreement vessels or proceeds from insurance for indemnification for loss of agreement vessels, earnings from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in a fund, and gains with respect to amounts or deposits in the fund. Transitional rules are also provided for the treatment of “old funds” existing on or before the effective date of the Merchant Marine Act of 1970 (see § 391.10).
            (b) Cross references. For rules relating to eligibility for a fund, deposits, and withdrawals and other aspects, see the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation in title 46 (Merchant Marine) and by the Secretary of Commerce in title 50 (Fisheries) of the Code of Federal Regulations.
            (c) Code. For purposes of this part, the term Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.
          
          
            § 391.2
            Ceiling on deposits.
            (a) In general—(1) Total ceiling. Section 607(b) of the Act provides a ceiling on the amount which may be deposited by a party for a taxable year pursuant to an agreement. The amount which a party may deposit into a fund may not exceed the sum of the following subceilings:
            (i) The lower of (a) the taxable income (if any) of the party for such year (computed as provided in chapter 1 of the Code but without regard to the carryback of any net operating loss or net capital loss and without regard to section 607 of the Act) or (b) taxable income (if any) of such party for such year attributable under paragraph (b) of this section to the operation of agreement vessels (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States or in the fisheries of the United States (see section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act),
            (ii) Amounts allowable as a deduction under section 167 of the Code for such year with respect to the agreement vessels (see section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act),

            (iii) The net proceeds (if not included in paragraph (a)(i) of this section) from (a) the sale or other disposition of any agreement vessels or (b) insurance or indemnity attributable to any agreement vessels (see section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and paragraph (c) of this section), and
            (iv) Earnings and gains from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in such fund (see section 607 (b)(1)(D) of the Act and paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section).
            (2) Overdeposits. (i) If for any taxable year an amount is deposited into the fund under a subceiling computed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section which is in excess of the amount of such subceiling for such year, then at the party's option such excess (or any portion thereof) may—
            (a) Be treated as a deposit into the fund for that taxable year under another available subceiling, or
            
            (b) Be treated as not having been deposited for the taxable year and thus, at the party's option, may be disposed of either by it being—
            (1) Treated as a deposit into the fund under any subceiling available in the first subsequent taxable year in which a subceiling is available, in which case such amount shall be deemed to have been deposited on the first day of such subsequent taxable year, or
            (2) Repaid to the party from the fund.
            (ii)(a) When a correction is made for an overdeposit, proper adjustment shall be made with respect to all items for all taxable years affected by the overdeposit, such as, for example, amounts in each account described in § 391.4, treatment of nonqualified withdrawals, the consequences of qualified withdrawals and the treatment of losses realized or treated as realized by the fund. Thus, for example, if the party chooses to have the fund repay to him the amount of an overdeposit, amounts in each account, basis of assets, and any affected item will be determined as though no deposit and repayment had been made. Accordingly, in such a case, if there are insufficient amounts in an account to cover a repayment of an overdeposit (as determined before correcting the overdeposit), and the party had applied the proceeds of a qualified withdrawal from such account towards the purchase of a qualified vessel (within the meaning of § 391.11(a)(2)), then such account and the basis of the vessel shall be adjusted as of the time such withdrawal was made and proceeds were applied, and repayment shall be made from such account as adjusted. If a party chooses to treat the amount of an overdeposit as a deposit under a subceiling for a subsequent year, similar adjustments to affected items shall be made. If the amount of a withdrawal would have exceeded the amount in the fund (determined after adjusting all affected amounts by reason of correcting the overdeposit), the withdrawal to the extent of such excess shall be treated as a repayment made at the time the withdrawal was made.
            (b) If the accounts (as defined in § 391.4) that were increased by reason of excessive deposits contain sufficient amounts at the time the overdeposit is discovered to repay the party, the party may, at his option, demand repayment of such excessive deposits from such accounts in lieu of making the adjustments required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(a) of this section.

            (iii) During the period beginning with the day after the date an overdeposit was actually made and ending with the date it was disposed of in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i)(b) of this section, there shall be included in the party's gross income for each taxable year the earnings attributed to any amount of overdeposit on hand during such a year. The earnings attributable to any amount of overdeposit on hand during a taxable year shall be an amount equal to the product of—
            (a) The average daily earnings for each one dollar in the fund (as determined in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section),
            (b) The amount of overdeposit (as determined in paragraph (a)(2)(vi) of this section), and
            (c) The number of days during the taxable year the overdeposit existed.
            (iv) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(a) of this section, the average daily earnings for each dollar in the fund shall be determined by dividing the total earnings of the fund for the taxable year by the sum of the products of—
            (a) Any amount on hand during the taxable year (determined under paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section), and
            (b) The number of days during the taxable year such amount was on hand in the fund.
            (v) For purposes of this paragraph—
            (a) An amount on hand in the fund or an overdeposit shall not be treated as on hand on the day deposited but shall be treated as on hand on the day withdrawn, and
            (b) The fair market value of such amounts on hand for purposes of this subparagraph shall be determined as provided in § 20.2031-2 of the Estate Tax Regulations of this chapter but without applying the blockage and other special rules contained in paragraph (e) thereof.
            (vi) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(b) of this section, the amount of overdeposit on hand at any time is an amount equal to—
            
            (a) The amount deposited into the fund under a subceiling computed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section which is in excess of the amount of such subceiling, less
            (b) The sum of—
            (1) Amounts described in paragraph (a)(2)(vi)(a) of this section treated as a deposit under another subceiling for the taxable year pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section,
            (2) Amounts described in paragraph (a)(2)(vi)(a) of this section disposed of (or treated as disposed of) in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section prior to such time.
            (vii) To the extent earnings attributed under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section represent a deposit for any taxable year in excess of the subceiling described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section for receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in the fund, such attributed earnings shall be subject to the rules of this paragraph for overdeposits.
            (3) Underdeposit caused by audit adjustment. [Reserved]
            (4) Requirements for deficiency deposits. [Reserved]
            (b) Taxable income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel—(1) In general. For purposes of this section, taxable income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel means the amount, if any, by which the gross income of a party for the taxable year from the operation of an agreement vessel (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) exceeds the allowable deductions allocable to such operation (as determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section). The term taxable income attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels means the sum of the amounts described in the preceding sentence separately computed with respect to each agreement vessel (or share therein) or, at the party's option, computed in the aggregate.
            (2) Gross income. (i) Gross income from the operation of agreement vessels means the sum of the revenues which are derived during the taxable year from the following:
            (a) Revenues derived from the transportation of passengers, freight, or mail in such vessels, including amounts from contracts for the charter of such vessels to others, from operating differential subsidies, from collections in accordance with pooling agreements and from insurance or indemnity net proceeds relating to the loss of income attributable to such agreement vessels.
            (b) Revenues derived from the operation of agreement vessels relating to commercial fishing activities, including the transportation of fish, support activities for fishing vessels, charters for commercial fishing, and insurance or indemnity net proceeds relating to the loss of income attributable to such agreement vessels.
            (c) Revenues from the rental lease, or use by others of terminal facilities, revenues from cargo handling operations and tug and lighter operations, and revenues from other services or operations which are incidental and directly related to the operation of an agreement vessel. Thus, for example, agency fees, commissions, and brokerage fees derived by the party at his place of business for effecting transactions for services incidental and directly related to shipping for the accounts of other persons are includible in gross income from the operation of agreement vessels where the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated by the party for his own account at such place of business.
            (d) Dividends, interest, and gains derived from assets set aside and reasonably retained to meet regularly occurring obligations relating to the shipping or fishing business directly connected with the agreement vessel which obligations cannot at all times be met from the current revenues of the business because of layups or repairs, special surveys, fluctuations in the business, and reasonably forseeable strikes (whether or not a strike actually occurs), and security amounts retained by reason of participation in conferences, pooling agreements, or similar agreements.

            (ii) The items of gross income described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (c) and (d) of this section shall be considered to be derived from the operations of a particular agreement vessel in the same proportion that the sum of the items of gross income described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (a) and (b) of this section which are derived from the operations of such agreement vessel bears to the party's total gross income for the taxable year from operations described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (a) and (b) of this section.
            (iii) In the case of a party who uses his own or leased agreement vessels to transport his own products, the gross income attributable to such vessel operations is an amount determined to be an arm's length charge for such transportation. The arm's length charge shall be determined by applying the principles of section 482 of the Code and the regulations thereunder as if the party transporting the product and the owner of the product were not the same person but were controlled taxpayers within the meaning of § 1.482-1(a)(4) of the Income Tax Regulations of this chapter. Gross income attributable to the operation of agreement vessels does not include amounts for which the party is allowed a deduction for percentage depletion under sections 611 and 613 of the Code.
            (3) Deductions. From the gross income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel or vessels as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, there shall be deducted in accordance with the principles of § 1.861-8 of the Income Tax Regulations of this chapter, the expenses, losses, and other deductions definitely related and therefore allocated and apportioned thereto and a ratable part of any expenses, losses, or other deductions which are not definitely related to any gross income of the party. Thus, for example, if a party has gross income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel and other gross income and has a particular deduction definitely related to both types of gross income, such deductions must be apportioned between the two types of gross income on a reasonable basis in determining the taxable income attributable to the operation of the agreement vessel.
            (4) Net operating and capital loss deductions. The taxable income of a party attributable to the operation of agreement vessels shall be computed without regard to the carryback of any net operating loss deduction allowed by section 172 of the Code, the carryback of any net capital loss deduction allowed by section 165(f) of the Code, or any reduction in taxable income allowed by section 607 of the Act.
            (5) Method of accounting. Taxable income must be computed under the method of accounting which the party uses for Federal income tax purposes. Such method may include a method of reporting whereby items of revenue and expense properly allocable to voyages in progress at the end of any accounting period are eliminated from the computation of taxable income for such accounting period and taken into account in the accounting period in which the voyage is completed.
            (c) Net proceeds from transactions with respect to agreement vessels. [Reserved]
            (d) Earnings and gains from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in a fund—(1) In general. (i) Earnings and gains received or accrued by a party from the investment or reinvestment of assets in a fund is the total amount of any interest or dividends received or accrued, and gains realized, by the party with respect to assets deposited in, or purchased with amounts deposited in, such fund. Such earnings and gains are therefore required to be included in the gross income of the party unless such amount, or a portion thereof, is not taken into account under section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act and § 391.3(b)(2)(ii) by reason of a deposit or deemed deposit into the fund. For rules relating to receipts from the sale or other disposition of nonmoney deposits into the fund, see paragraph (g) of this section.
            (ii) Earnings received or accrued by a party from investment or reinvestment of assets in a fund include the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount included in gross income pursuant to section 1232(a)(3) of the Code. Such ratable monthly portion shall be deemed to be deposited into the ordinary income account of the fund, but an actual deposit representing such ratable monthly portion shall not be made. For basis of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness issued at a discount, see § 391.3(b)(2)(ii)(b).
            (2) Gain realized. (i) The gain realized with respect to assets in the fund is the excess of the amount realized (as defined in section 1001(b) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) by the fund on the sale or other disposition of a fund asset over its adjusted basis (as defined in section 1011 of the Code) to the fund. For the adjusted basis of nonmoney deposits, see paragraph (g) of this section.
            (ii) Property purchased by the fund (including property considered under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section as purchased by the fund) which is withdrawn from the fund in a qualified withdrawal (as defined in § 391.5) is treated as a disposition to which subdivision (i) of this subparagraph applies. For purposes of determining the amount by which the balance within a particular account will be reduced in the manner provided in § 391.6(b) (relating to order of application of qualified withdrawals against accounts) and for purposes of determining the reduction in basis of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) pursuant to § 391.6(c), the value of the property is its fair market value on the day of the qualified withdrawal.
            (3) Holding Period. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the holding period of fund assets shall be determined under section 1223 of the Code.
            (e) Leased vessels. In the case of a party who is a lessee of an agreement vessel, the maximum amount which such lessee may deposit with respect to any agreement vessel by reason of section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act and paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section (relating to depreciation allowable) for any period shall be reduced by the amount (if any) which, under an agreement entered into under section 607 of the Act, the owner is required or permitted to deposit for such period with respect to such vessel by reason of section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act and paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The amount of depreciation depositable by the lessee under this paragraph is the amount of depreciation deductible by the lessor on its income tax return, reduced by the amount described in the preceding sentence or the amount set forth in the agreement, whichever is lower.
            (f) Definition of agreement vessel. For purposes of this section, the term agreement vessel (as defined in § 391.11 (a)(3) and 46 CFR 390.6) includes barges and containers which are the complement of an agreement vessel and which are provided for in the agreements, agreement vessels which have been contracted for or are in the process of construction, and any shares in an agreement vessel. Solely for purposes of this section, a party is considered to have a “share” in an agreement vessel if he has a right to use the vessel to generate income from its use whether or not the party would be considered as having a proprietary interest in the vessel for purposes of State or Federal law. Thus, a partner may enter into an agreement with respect to his share of the vessel owned by the partnership and he may make deposits of his distributive share of the sum of the four subceilings described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subchapter K of the Code (relating to the taxation of partners and partnerships), the Internal Revenue Service will recognize, solely for the purposes of applying this part, an agreement by an owner of a share in an agreement vessel even though the “share” arrangement is a partnership for purposes of the Code.
            (g) Special rules for nonmoney deposits and withdrawals—(1) In general. (i) Deposits may be made in the form of money or property of the type permitted to be deposited under the agreement. (For rules relating to the types of property which may be deposited into the fund, see 46 CFR 390.7(d), and 50 CFR part 259.) For purposes of this paragraph, the term property does not include money.
            (ii) Whether or not the election provided for in paragraph (g)(2) of this section is made—
            (a) The amount of any property deposit, and the fund's basis for property deposited in the fund, is the fair market value of the property at the time deposited, and
            (b) The fund's holding period for the property begins on the day after the deposit is made.

            (iii) Unless such an election is made, deposits of property into a fund are considered to be a sale at fair market value of the property, a deposit of cash equal to such fair market value, and a purchase by the fund of such property for cash. Thus, in the absence of the election, the difference between the fair market value of such property deposited and its adjusted basis shall be taken into account as gain or loss for purposes of computing the party's income tax liability for the year of deposit.
            (iv) For fund's basis and holding period of assets purchased by the fund, see paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section.
            (2) Election not to treat deposits of property other than money as a sale or exchange at the time of deposit. A party may elect to treat a deposit of property as if no sale or other taxable event had occurred on the date of deposit. If such election is made, in the taxable year the fund disposes of the property, the party shall recognize as gain or loss the amount he would have recognized on the day the property was deposited into the fund had the election not been made. The party's holding period with respect to such property shall not include the period of time such property was held by the fund. The election shall be made by a statement to that effect, attached to the party's Federal income tax return for the taxable year to which the deposit relates, or, if such return is filed before such deposit is made, attached to the party's return for the taxable year during which the deposit is actually made.
            (3) Effect of qualified withdrawal of property deposited pursuant to election. If property deposited into a fund, with respect to which an election under paragraph (g)(2) of this section is made, is withdrawn from the fund in a qualified withdrawal (as defined in § 391.5) such withdrawal is treated as a disposition of such property resulting in recognition by the party of gain or loss (if any) as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section with respect to nonfund property. In addition, such withdrawal is treated as a disposition of such property by the fund resulting in recognition of gain or loss by the party with respect to fund property to the extent the fair market value of the property on the date of withdrawal is greater or less (as the case may be) than the adjusted basis of the property to the fund on such date. For purposes of determining the amount by which the balance within a particular account will be reduced in the manner provided in § 391.6(b) (relating to order of application of qualified withdrawals against accounts and for purposes of determining the reduction in basis of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) pursuant to § 391.6(c), the value of the property is its fair market value on the day of the qualified withdrawal. For rules relating to the effect of a qualified withdrawal of property purchased by the fund (including deposited property considered under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section as purchased by the fund), see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
            (4) Effect of nonqualified withdrawal of property deposited pursuant to election. If property deposited into a fund with respect to which an election under paragraph (g)(2) of this section is made, is withdrawn from the fund in a nonqualified withdrawal (as defined in § 391.7(b)), no gain or loss is to be recognized by the party with respect to fund property or nonfund property but an amount equal to the adjusted basis of the property to the fund is to be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal. Thus, such amount is to be applied against the various accounts in the manner provided in § 391.7(c), such amount is to be taken into account in computing the party's taxable income as provided in § 391.7(d), and such amount is to be subject to interest to the extent provided for in § 391.7(e). In the case of withdrawals to which this subparagraph applies, the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the party is the adjusted basis on the date of deposit, increased or decreased by the adjustments made to such property while held in the fund, and in determining the period for which the party has held the property there shall be included, in addition to the period the fund held the property, the period for which the party held the property before the date of deposit of the property into the fund. For rules relating to the basis and holding period of property purchased by the fund (including deposited property considered under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section as purchased by the fund) and withdrawn in a nonqualified withdrawal see § 391.7(f).
            
            (5) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following examples:
            
            
              Example (1).
              X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, maintains a fund described in § 391.1 X's taxable income (determined without regard to section 607 of the Act) is $100,000, of which $80,000 is taxable income attributable to the operation of agreement vessels (as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section). Under the agreement, X is required to deposit into the fund all earnings and gains received from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in the fund, an amount equal to the net proceeds from transactions referred to in § 391.2(c), and an amount equal to 50 percent of its earnings attributable to the operation of agreement vessels provided that such 50 percent does not exceed X's taxable income from all sources for the year of deposit. The agreement permits X to make voluntary deposits of amounts equal to 100 percent of its earnings attributable to the operation of agreement vessels, subject to the limitation with respect to taxable income from all sources. The agreement also provides that deposits attributable to such earnings may be in the form of cash or other property. On March 15, 1973, X deposits, with respect to its 1972 earnings attributable to the operation of agreement vessels, stock with a fair market value at the time of deposit of $80,000 and an adjusted basis to X of $10,000. Such deposit represents agreement vessel income of $80,000. At the time of deposit, such stock had been held by X for a period exceeding 6 months. X does not elect under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to defer recognition of the gain. Accordingly, under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, the deposit is treated as a deposit of $80,000 and X realizes a long-term capital gain of $70,000 on March 15, 1973.
            
            
              Example (2).

              The facts are the same as in example (1), except that X elects in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph not to treat the deposit as a sale or exchange. On July 1, 1974, the fund sells the stock for $85,000. The basis to the fund of the stock is $80,000 (see subparagraph (1)(ii)(a) of this paragraph). With respect to non fund property, X recognizes $70,000 of long-term capital gain on the sale includible in its gross income for 1974. With respect to fund property, X realizes $5,000 of long-term capital gain (the difference between the amount received by the fund on the sale of the stock, $85,000, and the basis to the fund of the stock, $80,000), an amount equal to which is required to be deposited into the fund with respect to 1974, as a gain from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in the fund. Since the fund held the stock for a period exceeding 6 months, the $5,000 is allocated to the fund's capital gain account under § 391.4(c).
            
            
              Example (3).
              The facts are the same as in example (2), except that the fund sells the stock on July 1, 1974, for $75,000. As the basis to the fund of the stock is $80,000 with respect to fund property, X realizes a long-term capital loss on the sale (the difference between the amount received by the fund on the sale of the stock, $75,000, and the basis to the fund of the stock, $80,000), of $5,000, an amount equal to which is required to be charged against the fund's capital gain account under § 391.4(e). Under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, X recognizes $70,000 of long-term capital gain with respect to nonfund property on the sale which is includible in its gross income for 1974.
            
            
              Example (4).
              The facts are the same as in example (2), except that on July 1, 1974, X makes a qualified withdrawal (as defined in § 391.5(a)) of the stock and uses it to pay indebtedness pursuant to § 391.5(b). On the disposition by X considered to occur under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph on the qualified withdrawal, X recognizes $70,000 of long-term capital gain with respect to nonfund property, which is includible in its gross income for 1974, and a long-term capital gain of $5,000 with respect to fund property, an amount equal to which is allocated to the fund's capital gain account under § 391.4(c). The fund is treated as having a qualified withdrawal of an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock on the day of withdrawal, $85,000 (see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph). In addition, $85,000 is applied against the various accounts in the order provided in § 391.6(b). The basis of the vessel with respect to which the indebtedness was incurred is to be reduced as provided in § 391.6(c).
            
            
              Example (5).
              The facts are the same as in example (2), except that X withdraws the stock from the fund in a nonqualified withdrawal (as defined in § 391.7(b)). Under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, X recognizes no gain or loss with respect to fund or nonfund property on such withdrawal. An amount equal to the basis of the stock to the fund ($80,000) is applied against the various accounts in the order provided in § 391.7(c), and is taken into account in computing X's taxable income for 1974 as provided in § 391.7(d). In addition, X must pay interest on the withdrawal as provided in § 391.7(e). The basis to X of the stock is $10,000 notwithstanding the fact that the fair market value of such stock was $85,000 on the day of withdrawal (see paragraph (g)(4) of this section).
            
          
          
            § 391.3
            Nontaxability of deposits.
            (a) In general. Section 607(d) of the Act sets forth the rules concerning the income tax effects of deposits made with respect to ceilings described in section 607(b) and § 391.2. The specific treatment of deposits with respect to each of the subceilings is set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
            (b) Treatment of deposits—(1) Earnings of agreement vessels. Section 607 (d)(1)(A) of the Act provides that taxable income of the party (determined without regard to section 607 of the Act) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount deposited for the taxable year out of amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and § 391.2(a)(1)(i). For computation of the foreign tax credit, see paragraph (i) of this section.
            (2) Net proceeds from agreement vessels and fund earnings. (i)(a) Section 607(d)(1)(B) provides that gain from a transaction referred to in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and § 391.2(a)(1)(iii) (relating to ceilings on deposits of net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of agreement vessels) is not to be taken into account for purposes of the Code if an amount equal to the net proceeds from transactions referred to in such sections is deposited in the fund. Such gain is to be excluded from gross income of the party for the taxable year to which such deposit relates. Thus, the gain will not be taken into account in applying section 1231 of the Code for the year to which the deposit relates.
            (b) [Reserved]
            (ii)(a) Section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act provides that the earnings (including gains and losses) from the investment and reinvestment of amounts held in the fund and referred to in section 607(b)(1)(D) of the Act and § 391.2(a)(1)(iv) shall not be taken into account for purposes of the Code if an amount equal to such earnings is deposited into the fund. Such earnings are to be excluded from the gross income of the party for the taxable year to which such deposit relates.
            (b) However, for purposes of the basis adjustment under section 1232(a)(3)(E) of the Code, the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount included in gross income shall be determined without regard to section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act.
            (iii) In determining the tax liability of a party to whom paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies, taxable income, determined after application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is in effect reduced by the portion of deposits which represent gain or earnings respectively referred to in paragraph (b)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section. The excess, if any, of such portion over taxable income determined after application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is taken into account in computing the net operating loss (under section 172 of the Code) for the taxable year to which such deposits relate.
            (3) Time for making deposits. (i) This section applies with respect to an amount only if such amount is deposited in the fund pursuant to the agreement and not later than the time provided in paragraph (b)(2) (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section for the making of such deposit or the date the Secretary of Transportation provides, whichever is earlier.
            (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) (iii) or (iv) of this section, a deposit may be made not later than the last day prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the party's Federal income tax return for the taxable year to which such deposit relates.
            (iii) If the party is a subsidized operator under an operating-differential subsidy contract, and does not receive on or before the 59th day preceding such last day, payment of all or part of the accrued operating-differential subsidy payable for the taxable year, the party may deposit an amount equivalent to the unpaid accrued operating-differential subsidy on or before the 60th day after receipt of payment of the accrued operating-differential subsidy.
            (iv) A deposit pursuant to § 391.2(a)(3)(i) (relating to underdeposits caused by audit adjustments) must be made on or before the date prescribed for such a deposit in § 391.2(a)(4).
            (4) Date of deposits. (i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(4) (ii) and (iii) of this section (with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and prior to January 1, 1972), in § 391.2(a)(2)(i), or in § 391.10(b), deposits made in a fund within the time specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are deemed to have been made on the date of actual deposit.
            
            (ii)(a) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and prior to January 1, 1971, where an application for a fund is filed by a taxpayer prior to January 1, 1972, and an agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer prior to March 1, 1972,
            (b) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and prior to January 1, 1972, where an application for a fund is filed by a taxpayer prior to January 1, 1973, and an agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer prior to March 1, 1973, and
            (c) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, and prior to January 1, 1975, where an agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer on or prior to the due date, with extensions, for the filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year, deposits in a fund which are made within 60 days after the date of execution of the agreement, or on or before the due date, with extensions thereof, for the filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year or years, whichever date shall be later, shall be deemed to have been made on the date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of the last regular business day of each such taxable year or years to which such deposits relate, whichever day is earlier.
            (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and ending prior to January 1, 1972, deposits made later than the last date permitted under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) but on or before January 9, 1973, in a fund pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary of Transportation acting by and through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall be deemed to have been made on the date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of the last regular business day of such taxable year, whichever is earlier.
            (c) Determination of earnings and profits. [Reserved]
            (d) Accumulated earnings tax. As provided in section 607(d)(1)(E) of the Act amounts, while held in the fund, are not to be taken into account in computing the “accumulated taxable income” of the party within the meaning of section 531 of the Code. Amounts while held in the fund are considered held for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, or reconstructing a qualified vessel or barges and containers which are part of the complement of a qualified vessel or the payment of the principal on indebtedness incurred in connection with any such acquisition, construction, or reconstruction. Thus, for example, if the reasonable needs of the business (within the meaning of section 537 of the Code) justify a greater amount of accumulation for providing replacement vessels than can be satisfied out of the fund, such greater amount accumulated outside of the fund shall be considered to be accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business. For a further example, although amounts in the fund are not taken into account in applying the tax imposed by section 531 of the Code, to the extent there are amounts in a fund to provide for replacing a vessel, amounts accumulated outside of the fund to replace the same vessel are not considered to be accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business.
            (e) Nonapplicability of section 1231. If an amount equivalent to gain from a transaction referred to in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and § 391.2(c) (1) and (5) is deposited into the fund and, therefore, such gain is not taken into account in computing gross income under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, then such gain will not be taken into account for purposes of the computations under section 1231 of the Code.
            (f) Deposits of capital gains. In respect of capital gains which are not included in the gross income of the party by virtue of a deposit to which section 607(d) of the Act and this section apply, the following provisions of the Code do not apply; the minimum tax for tax preferences imposed by section 56 of the Code; the alternative tax imposed by section 1201 of the Code on the excess of the party's net long-term capital gain over his net short-term capital loss; and, in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, the deduction provided by section 1202 of the Code of 50 percent of the amount of such excess. However, section 56 may apply upon a nonqualified withdrawal with respect to amounts treated under § 391.7(d)(2) as being made out of the capital gain account.
            (g) Deposits of dividends. The deduction provided by section 243 of the Code (relating to the deductions for dividends from a domestic corporation received by a corporation) shall not apply in respect of dividends (earned on assets held in the fund) which are deposited into a fund, and which, by virtue of such deposits and the provisions of section 607(d) of the Act and this section, are not included in the gross income of the party.
            (h) Presumption of validity of deposit. All amounts deposited in the fund shall be presumed to have been deposited pursuant to an agreement unless, after an examination of the facts upon the request of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his delegate, the Secretary of Transportation determines otherwise. The Commissioner or his delegate will request such a determination where there is a substantial question as to whether a deposit is made in accordance with an agreement.
            (i) Special rules for application of the foreign tax credit—(1) In general. For purposes of computing the limitation under section 904 of the Code on the amount of the credit provided by section 901 of the Code (relating to the foreign tax credit), the party's taxable income from any source without the United States and the party's entire taxable income are to be determined after application of section 607(d) of the Act. Thus, amounts deposited for the taxable year with respect to amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and § 391.2(a)(1)(i) (relating to taxable income attributable to the operation of agreement vessels) shall be treated as a deduction in arriving at the party's taxable income from sources without the United States (subject to the apportionment rules and paragraph (i)(2) of this section) and the party's entire taxable income for the taxable year. Amounts deposited with respect to gain described in section 607(d)(1)(B) of the Act and § 391.2(c) (relating to net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of an agreement vessel and net proceeds from insurance or indemnity) and amounts deposited with respect to earnings described in section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act and paragraph (b)(2)(ii) (relating to earnings from the investment and reinvestment of amounts held in a fund) of this section are not taken into account for purposes of the Code and hence are not included in the party's taxable income from sources without the United States or in the party's entire taxable income for purposes of this paragraph.
            (2) Apportionment of taxable income attributable to agreement vessels. For purposes of computing the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2) of the Code the amount of the deposit made with respect to taxable income attributable to agreement vessels pursuant to § 391.2(a)(1)(i) which is allocable to sources without the United States is the total amount of such deposit multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the gross income from sources without the United States from the operation of agreement vessels and the denominator of which is the total gross income from the operation of agreement vessels computed as provided in § 391.2(b)(2). For purposes of this paragraph, gross income from sources without the United States attributable to the operation of agreement vessels is to be determined under sections 61 through 863 of the Code and under the taxpayer's usual method of accounting provided such method is reasonable and in keeping with sound accounting practice. Any computation under the per-country limitation of section 904(a)(1) shall be made in the manner consistent with the provisions of the preceding sentences of this paragraph.
          
          
            § 391.4
            Establishment of accounts.
            (a) In general. Section 607(e)(1) of the Act requires that three bookkeeping or memorandum accounts are to be established and maintained within the fund: The capital account, the capital gain account, and the ordinary income account. Deposits of the amounts under the subceilings in section 607(b) of the Act and § 391.2 are allocated among the accounts under section 607(e) of the Act and this section.
            (b) Capital account. The capital account shall consist of:

            (1) Amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act and § 391.2 (a)(1)(ii) (relating to deposits for depreciation),
            (2) Amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and § 391.2(a)(1)(iii) (relating to deposits of net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of agreement vessels) other than that portion thereof which represents gain not taken into account for purposes of computing gross income by reason of section 607(d)(1)(B) of the Act and § 391.3(b)(2) (relating to nontaxability of gain from the sale or other disposition of an agreement vessel),
            (3) Amounts representing 85 percent of any dividend received by the fund with respect to which the party would, but for section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act and § 391.3(b)(2)(ii) (relating to nontaxability of deposits of earnings from investment and reinvestment of amounts held in a fund), be allowed a deduction under section 243 of the Code, and
            (4) Amounts received by the fund representing interest income which is exempt from taxation under section 103 of the Code.
            (c) Capital gain account. The capital gain account shall consist of amounts which represent the excess of (1) deposits of long-term capital gains on property referred to in section 607(b)(1) (C) and (D) of the Act and § 391.2(a)(1) (iii) and (iv) (relating respectively to certain agreement vessels and fund assets), over (2) amounts representing losses from the sale or exchange of assets held in the fund for more than 6 months (for purposes of this section referred to as “long-term capital losses”). For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an agreement vessel disposed of at a gain shall be treated as a capital asset to the extent that gain thereon is not treated as ordinary income, including gain which is ordinary income under section 607(g)(5) of the Act (relating to treatment of gain on disposition of a vessel with a reduced basis) and § 391.6(e) or under section 1245 of the Code (relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable property). For provisions relating to the treatment of short-term capital gains on certain transactions involving agreement vessels or realized by the fund, see paragraph (d) of this section. For rules relating to the treatment of capital losses on assets held in the fund, see paragraph (e) of this section.
            (d) Ordinary income account. The ordinary income account shall consist of:
            (1) Amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and § 391.2(a)(1)(i) (relating to taxable income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel),
            (2) Amounts representing (i) deposits of gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for 6 months or less (for purposes of this section referred to as “short-term capital gains”) referred to in section 607(b)(1) (C) or (D) of the Act and § 391.2(a)(1) (iii) and (iv) (relating respectively to certain agreement vessels and fund assets), reduced by (ii) amounts representing losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets held in the fund for 6 months or less (for purposes of this section referred to as “short-term capital losses”). For rules relating to the treatment of certain agreement vessels as capital assets, see paragraph (c) of this section,
            (3) Amounts representing interest (not including any tax-exempt interest referred to in section 607(e)(2)(D) of the Act and paragraph (b)(4) of this section) and other ordinary income received on assets held in the fund (not including any dividend referred to in section 607(e)(2)(C) of the Act and paragraph (d)(5) of this section),
            (4) Amounts representing ordinary income from a transaction (involving certain net proceeds with respect to an agreement vessel) described in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and § 391.2(a)(1)(iii), including gain which is ordinary income under section 607(g)(5) of the Act and § 391.6(e) (relating to treatment of gain on the disposition of a vessel with a reduced basis) or under section 1245 of the Code (relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable property), and
            (5) Fifteen percent of any dividend referred to in section 607(e)(2)(C) of the Act and paragraph (b)(3) of this section received on any assets held in the fund.
            (e) Limitation on deduction for capital losses on assets held in a fund. Except on termination of a fund, long-term (and short-term) capital losses on assets held in a fund shall be allowed only as an offset to long-term (and short-term) capital gains on assets held in the fund, but only if such gains are deposited into the fund, and shall not be allowed as an offset to any capital gains on assets not held in the fund. The net long-term capital loss of the fund for the taxable year shall reduce the earliest long-term capital gains in the capital gain account at the beginning of the taxable year and the next short-term capital loss for the taxable year shall reduce the earliest short-term capital gains remaining in the ordinary income account at the beginning of the taxable year. Any such losses that are in excess of the capital gains in the respective accounts shall reduce capital gains deposited into the respective accounts in subsequent years (without regard to section 1212, relating to capital loss carrybacks and carryovers). On termination of a fund, any net long-term capital loss in the capital gain account and any net short-term capital loss remaining in the ordinary income accounts is to be taken into account for purposes of computing the party's taxable income for the year of termination as a long-term or short-term (as the case may be) capital loss recognized in the year the fund is terminated. With respect to the determination of the basis to a fund of assets held in such fund, see § 391.2(g).
          
          
            § 391.5
            Qualified withdrawals.
            (a) In general. (1) A qualified withdrawal is one made from the fund during the taxable year which is in accordance with section 670(f)(1) of the Act, the agreement, and with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation and which is for the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel (as defined in § 391.11(a)(2)) or barges and containers which are part of the complement of a qualified vessel (or shares in such vessels, barges, and containers), or for the payment of the principal of indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition construction, or reconstruction of such qualified vessel (or a barge or container which is part of the complement of a qualified vessel).
            (2) For purposes of this section the term share is used to reflect an interest in a vessel and means a proprietary interest in a vessel such as, for example, that which results from joint ownership. Accordingly, a share within the meaning of § 391.2(f) (relating to the definition of “agreement vessel” for the purpose of making deposits) will not necessarily be sufficient to be treated as a share within the meaning of this section.
            (3) For purposes of this section, the term acquisition means any of the following:
            (i) Any acquisition, but only to the extent the basis of the property acquired in the hands of the transferee is its cost. Thus, for example, if a party transfers a vessel and $1 million in an exchange for another vessel which qualifies for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031(a) of the Code (relating to like-kind exchange), there is an acquisition to the extent of $1 million.
            (ii) With respect to a lessee's interest in a vessel, expenditures which result in increasing the amounts with respect to which a deduction for depreciation (or amortization in lieu thereof) is allowable.
            (b) Payments on indebtedness. Payments on indebtedness may constitute qualified withdrawals only if the party shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Transportation a direct connection between incurring the indebtedness and the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel or its complement of barges and containers whether or not the indebtedness is secured by the vessel or its complement of barges and containers. The fact that an indebtedness is secured by an interest in a qualified vessel, barge, or container is insufficient by itself to demonstrate the necessary connection.
            (c) Payments to related persons. Not- withstanding paragraph (a) of this section, payments from a fund to a person owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests as the party within the meaning of section 482 of the Code and the regulations thereunder are not to be treated as qualified withdrawals unless the party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Transportation that no part of such payment constitutes a dividend, a return of capital, or a contribution to capital under the Code.
            
            (d) Treatment of fund upon failure to fulfill obligations. Section 607(f)(2) of the Act provides that if the Secretary of Transportation determines that any substantial obligation under the agreement is not being fulfilled, he may, after notice and opportunity for hearing to the party, treat the entire fund, or any portion thereof, as having been withdrawn as a nonqualified withdrawal. In determining whether a party has breached a substantial obligation under the agreement, the Secretary will consider among other things, (1) the effect of the party's action or omission upon his ability to carry out the purposes of the fund and for which qualified withdrawals are permitted under section 607(f)(1) of the Act, and (2) whether the party has made material misrepresentations in connection with the agreement or has failed to disclose material information. For the income tax treatment of nonqualified withdrawals, see § 391.7.
          
          
            § 391.6
            Tax treatment of qualified withdrawals.
            (a) In general. Section 607(g) of the Act and this section provide rules for the income tax treatment of qualified withdrawals including the income tax treatment on the disposition of assets acquired with fund amounts.
            (b) Order of application of qualified withdrawals against accounts. A qualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated as being made: First, out of the capital account; second, out of the capital gain account; and third, out of the ordinary income account. Such withdrawals will reduce the balance within a particular account on a first-in-first-out basis, the earliest qualified withdrawals reducing the items within an account in the order in which they were actually deposited or deemed deposited in accordance with this part. The date funds are actually withdrawn from the fund determines the time at which withdrawals are considered to be made.
            (c) Reduction of basis. (1) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) is made out of the ordinary income account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) shall be reduced by an amount equal to such portion.
            (2) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for the acquisition, construction or reconstruction of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) is made out of the capital gain account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) shall be reduced by an amount equal to—
            (i) Five-eights of such portion, in the case of a corporation (other than an electing small business corporation, as defined in section 1371 of the Code), or
            (ii) One-half of such portion, in the case of any other person.

            (3) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal to pay the principal of an indebtedness is made out of the ordinary income account or the capital gain account, then the basis of the vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) with respect to which such indebtedness was incurred is reduced in the manner provided by paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section. If the aggregate amount of such withdrawal from the ordinary income account and capital gain account would cause a basis reduction in excess of the party's basis in such vessel, barge, or container (or share therein), the excess is applied against the basis of other vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) owned by the party at the time of withdrawal in the following order: (i) Vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) which were the subject of qualified withdrawals in the order in which they were acquired, constructed, or reconstructed; (ii) agreement vessels (as defined in section 607(k)(3) of the Act and § 391.11(a)(3)) and barges and containers which are part of the complement of an agreement vessel (or shares therein) which were not the subject of qualified withdrawals, in the order in which such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) were acquired by the party; and (iii) other vessels, barges, and containers (or shares therein), in the order in which they were acquired by the party. Any amount of a withdrawal remaining after the application of this paragraph is to be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal. If the indebtedness was incurred to acquire two or more vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein), then the basis reduction in such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) is to be made pro rata in proportion to the adjusted basis of such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) computed, however, without regard to this section and adjustments under section 1016(a) (2) and (3) of the Code for depreciation or amortization.
            (d) Basis for depreciation. For purposes of determining the allowance for depreciation under section 167 of the Code in respect of any property which has been acquired, constructed, or reconstructed from qualified withdrawals, the adjusted basis for determining gain on such property is determined after applying paragraph (c) of this section. In the case of reductions in the basis of any property resulting from the application of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the party may adopt a method of accounting whereby (1) payments shall reduce the basis of the property on the day such payments are actually made, or (2) payments made at any time during the first half of the party's taxable year shall reduce the basis of the property on the first day of the taxable year, and payments made at any time during the second half of the party's taxable year shall reduce the basis of the property on the first day of the succeeding taxable year. For requirements respecting the change of methods of accounting, see § 1.446-1(e)(3) of the Income Tax Regulations of this chapter.
            (e) Ordinary income treatment of gain from disposition of property acquired with qualified withdrawals. [Reserved]
          
          
            § 391.7
            Tax treatment of nonqualified withdrawals.
            (a) In general. Section 607(h) of the Act provides rules for the tax treatment of nonqualified withdrawals, including rules for adjustments to the various accounts of the fund, the inclusion of amounts in income, and the payment of interest with respect to such amounts.
            (b) Nonqualified withdrawals defined. Except as provided in section 607 of the Act and § 391.8 (relating to certain corporate reorganizations, changes in partnerships, and transfers by reason of death), any withdrawal from a fund which is not a qualified withdrawal shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal which is subject to tax in accordance with section 607(h) of the Act and the provisions of this section. Examples of nonqualified withdrawals are amounts remaining in a fund upon termination of the fund, and withdrawals which are treated as nonqualified withdrawals under section 607(f)(2) of the Act and § 391.5(d) (relating to failure by a party to fulfill substantial obligation under agreement) or under the second sentence of section 607(g)(4) of the Act and § 391.6(c)(3) (relating to payments against indebtedness in excess of basis).
            (c) Order of application of nonqualified withdrawals against deposits. A nonqualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated as being made: First, out of the ordinary income account; second, out of the capital gain account; and third, out of the capital account. Such withdrawals will reduce the balance within a particular account on a first-in-first-out basis, the earliest nonqualified withdrawals reducing the items within an account in the order in which they were actually deposited or deemed deposited in accordance with this part. Nonqualified withdrawals for research, development, and design expenses incident to new and advanced ship design, machinery, and equipment, and any amount treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under the second sentence of section 607(g)(4) of the Act and § 391.6(c)(3), shall be applied against the deposits within a particular account on a last-in-first-out basis. The date funds are actually withdrawn from the fund determines the time at which withdrawals are considered to be made. For special rules concerning the withdrawal of contingent deposits of net proceeds from the installment sale of an agreement vessel, see § 391.2(c)(6).
            (d) Inclusion in income. (1) Any portion of a nonqualified withdrawal which, under paragraph (c) of this section, is treated as being made out of the ordinary income account is to be included in gross income as an item of ordinary income for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made.

            (2) Any portion of a nonqualified withdrawal which, under paragraph (c) of this section, is treated as being made out of the capital gain account is to be included in income as an item of long-term capital gain recognized during the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made.
            (3) For effect upon a party's taxable income of capital losses remaining in a fund upon the termination of a fund (which, under paragraph (b) of this section, is treated as a nonqualified withdrawal of amounts remaining in the fund), see § 391.4(e).
            (e) Interest. (1) For the period on or before the last date prescribed by law, including extensions thereof, for filing the party's Federal income tax return for the taxable year during which a nonqualified withdrawal is made, no interest shall be payable under section 6601 of the Code in respect of the tax on any item which is included in gross income under paragraph (d) of this section, and no addition to such tax for such period shall be payable under section 6651 of the Code. In lieu of the interest and additions to tax under such sections, simple interest on the amount of the tax attributable to any item included in gross income under paragraph (d) of this section is to be paid at the rate of interest determined for the year of withdrawal under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Such interest is to be charged for the period from the last date prescribed for payment of tax for the taxable year for which such item was deposited in the fund to the last date for payment of tax for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made. Both dates are to be determined without regard to any extensions of time for payment. Interest determined under this paragraph which is paid within the taxable year shall be allowed as a deduction for such year under section 163 of the Code. However, such interest is to be treated as part of the party's tax for the year of withdrawal for purposes of collection and in determining any interest or additions to tax for the year of withdrawal under section 6601 or 6651, respectively, of the Code.
            (2) For purposes of section 607(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, and for purposes of certain dispositions of vessels constructed, reconstructed, or acquired with qualified withdrawals described in § 391.6(e), the applicable rate of interest for any nonqualified withdrawal—
            (i) Made in a taxable year beginning in 1970 and 1971 is 8 percent.

            (ii) Made in a taxable year beginning after 1971, the rate for such year as determined and published jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate and the Secretary of Transportation. Such rate shall bear a relationship to 8 percent which the Secretaries determine to be comparable to the relationship which the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year bear to the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year 1970. The determination of the applicable rate for any such taxable year will be computed by multiplying 8 percent by the ratio which (a) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of such taxable year, bears to (b) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year 1970. The applicable rate so determined shall be computed to the nearest one-hundredth of 1 percent. If such a determination and publication is made, the latest published percentage shall apply for any taxable year beginning in the calendar year with respect to which publication is made.
            (3) No interest shall be payable in respect of taxes on amounts referred to in section 607(h)(2) (i) and (ii) of the Act (relating to withdrawals for research and development and payments against indebtedness in excess of basis) or in the case of any nonqualified withdrawal arising from the application of the recapture provision of section 606(5) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as in effect on December 31, 1969.
            (f) Basis and holding period in the case of property purchased by the fund or considered purchased by the fund. In the case of a nonqualified withdrawal of property other than money which was purchased by the fund (including deposited property considered under § 391.2 (g)(1)(ii) as purchased by the fund), the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the party is its adjusted basis to the fund on the day of the withdrawal. In determining the period for which the taxpayer has held the property withdrawn in a nonqualified withdrawal, there shall be included only the period beginning with the date on which the withdrawal occurred. For basis and holding period in the case of nonqualified withdrawals of property other than money deposited into the fund, see § 391.2(g)(4).
          
          
            § 391.8
            Certain corporate reorganizations and changes in partnerships, and certain transfers on death. [Reserved]
          
          
            § 391.9
            Consolidated returns. [Reserved]
          
          
            § 391.10
            Transitional rules for existing funds.
            (a) In general. Section 607(j) of the Act provides that any person who was maintaining a fund or funds under section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, prior to its amendment by the Merchant Marine Act of 1970 (for purposes of this part referred to as “old fund”) may continue to maintain such old fund in the same manner as under prior law subject to the limitations contained in section 607(j) of the Act. Thus, a party may not simultaneously maintain such old fund and a new fund established under the Act.
            (b) Extension of agreement to new fund. If a person enters into an agreement under the Act to establish a new fund, he may agree to the extension of such agreement to some or all of the amounts in the old fund and transfer the amounts in the old fund to which the agreement is to apply from the old fund to the new fund. If an agreement to establish a new fund is extended to amounts from an old fund, each item in the old fund to which such agreement applies shall be considered to be transferred to the appropriate account in the manner provided for in § 391.8(d) in the new fund in a nontaxable transaction which is in accordance with the provisions of the agreement under which such old fund was maintained. For purposes of determining the amount of interest under section 607(h)(3)(C) of the Act and § 391.7(e), the date of deposit of any item so transferred shall be deemed to be July 1, 1971, or the date of the deposit in the old fund, whichever is the later.
          
          
            § 391.11
            Definitions.

              § 393.2
              Marine Highway Routes.
              (a) What are the minimum eligibility requirements for MARAD to recommend a Marine Highway Route for the Secretary to designate? (1) MARAD may recommend Marine Highway Routes that relieve landside congestion along coastal corridors or that promote short sea transportation; and
              (2) That advance the objectives of the AMHP in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (b) When can a Route Sponsor request designation of a Marine Highway Route? (1) The Department accepts Marine Highway Route designation requests any time. Route Sponsors must submit designation requests through the Program Office.

              (2) The Maritime Administration publishes all designated Routes on its Web site. Go to http://www.marad.dot.gov and search “America's Marine Highways” to see the current list.
              (c) What should Route Sponsors consider when preparing Marine Highway Route designation requests? (1) Route Sponsors designation requests should explain how a proposed route will help achieve the following objectives:
              (i) Establishing Marine Highway Routes as extensions of the national surface transportation system;
              (ii) Developing multi-jurisdictional coalitions and partnerships that focus public and private efforts to improve reliability and resiliency of the Route for freight and passengers;
              (iii) Obtaining public benefits as described in paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of this section; and
              (iv) Identifying potential savings that could be realized by providing an alternative to existing supply chains through short sea transportation.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (d) What information should Route Sponsors include in their designation requests? (1) One or more eligible Route Sponsors may submit Marine Highway Route designation requests to the Program Office. Designation requests should include the following information:
              (i) Physical Description of the Proposed Marine Highway Route. Describe the proposed Marine Highway Route, and its connection to existing or planned transportation infrastructure and intermodal facilities. Include key navigational factors such as available draft, channel width, bridge air draft, or lock clearance, and any foreseeable impacts on navigation or commerce. When available, include one or more maps of the proposed Route.
              (ii) Surface transportation regions served. (A) Land transportation routes that would benefit. Provide a summary of any land transportation route that the Marine Highway Route would benefit. Include a description of the route, its primary users, the nature, locations and occurrence of travel delays, urban areas affected, and other geographic or jurisdictional issues that impact its overall operation and performance.
              (B) U.S. Domestic Shipping Lane Served. For Marine Highway Routes that pass through waters outside U.S. territorial waters, provide a summary of the shipping routes or trade lanes that the Marine Highway Route would benefit. Include a description of the route, its primary users, the nature, locations and occurrence of travel delays, urban areas affected, and other geographic or jurisdictional issues that impact its overall operation and performance.
              (iii) Involved parties. Provide the organizational structure of the Route Sponsors and supporters recommending the Route designation, including business affiliations and private sector stakeholders. Multi-jurisdictional coalitions may include State Departments of Transportation, metropolitan planning organizations, municipalities and other governmental entities (including tribal governments). Include the extent to which these entities have expressed support for the route designation and describe any affiliations with environmental groups or civic associations, or affiliations with any foreign interests.
              (iv) Volume and characteristics. If authoritative data are available, provide the volume of passengers and/or cargo that are candidates for shifting to water transportation on the proposed Route. Otherwise provide estimates for this information, include identified shippers, manufacturers, distributors, and other entities that could benefit from a Marine Highway alternative, and the extent to which these entities have expressed support for the Marine Highway Route designation request.
              (v) Congestion reduction. Describe the extent to which the proposed Route could relieve landside congestion in measurable terms, if applicable. Include any known offsetting land transportation infrastructure savings (either construction or maintenance) that would likely result from the Route, if applicable.
              (vi) Public benefits. Provide, if known, the net savings over status quo in emissions, including greenhouse gases, energy consumption, landside infrastructure maintenance costs, safety and system resiliency. Specify if the Marine Highway Route represents the most cost-effective option among other modal improvements. Include consideration of the implications future growth may have on the proposed Route.
              (vii) Public costs. If applicable and known, identify any costs that may result from designation of the route. If able, provide costs that are quantifiable such as the additional cost of emissions or energy consumption required to effectively leverage the benefits of the designated route. These costs should be a component in the net savings identified in paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of this section.
              (viii) Impediments. Describe known or anticipated obstacles to utilization of the proposed Marine Highway Route. Include any strategies, either in place or proposed, to deal with the impediments.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (e) How will the Program Office evaluate and recommend Marine Highway Route designation requests?

              (x) Maintain liaison with Project Applicants and representatives of designated Projects to provide ongoing support and identify lessons learned and best practices for other projects and the overall Marine Highway program.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (f) How will the Department protect confidential information? (1) If your application, including attachments, includes information that you consider to be a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information, or otherwise exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), as implemented by the Department at 49 CFR part 7, you may assert a claim of confidentiality.
              (2) What should I do if I believe my Project designation application contains confidential or business sensitive information? (i) Note on the front cover that the submission “Contains Confidential Business Information (CBI);”
              (ii) Mark each affected page “CBI;” and
              (iii) Clearly highlight or otherwise denote the CBI portions. The USDOT protects such information from disclosure to the extent allowed under applicable law.
              (3) What will happen if information related to my Project designation application is the subject of a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)? We will apply the procedures contained in 49 CFR part 7 to a request from non-Federal third-parties for information related to documents you submit under this part. We will consider your claim of confidentiality at the time someone requests the information under FOIA. Only information that is ultimately determined to be confidential under that procedure will be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
              (g) Is there a specific format required for project designation applications and attached documents? (1) When responding to specific solicitations for Marine Highway Projects by the Program Office, Project Applicants should include all of the information requested by paragraph (c) of this section organized in a manner consistent with the elements set forth in that section. The Program Office reserves the right to ask any applicant to supplement the data in its application, but expects applications to be complete upon submission. The narrative portion of an application should not exceed 20 pages in length. Documentation supporting the assertions made in the narrative portion may also be provided in the form of appendices, but limited to relevant information. Applications may be submitted electronically via regulations.gov (http://www.regulations.gov). Applications submitted in writing must include the original and three copies and must be on 8.5″ x 11″ single spaced paper, excluding maps, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) representations, etc.
              
              (2) In the event that the Project Applicant of a Marine Highway Project that has already been designated by the Secretary seeks a modification to the designation because of a change in project scope, an expansion of the project, or other significant change to the project, the Project Applicant should request the change in writing to the Secretary via the Maritime Administrator. The request must contain any changed or new information that is relevant to the project.
              (h) What does the Program Office do to ensure designated projects are developing properly? (1) Once designated projects enter the operational phase (either start of a new service, or expansion of existing service), the Program Office will evaluate them regularly to determine if the project is likely to achieve its objectives.
              (2) Overall project performance will be assessed according to three categories—exceeds, meets, or does not meet original projections—in each of the three areas defined below:
              (i) Public benefit. Does the Project meet the stated goals in shifting specific numbers of vehicles (number of trucks, rail cars or automobiles) off the designated landside routes? The Program Office will assume other public benefits, including energy savings, reduced emissions, and safety improvements to be a direct derivative of either numbers of vehicles reduced, or vehicle/ton miles avoided, unless specific factors change (such as a change in vessel fuel or emissions).
              (ii) Public cost. Is the overall cost to the Federal Government (if any) on track with estimates at the time of designation? The overall cost to the Federal Government represents the amount of Federal investment (i.e., direct funding, loan guarantees or similar mechanisms) reduced by the offsetting savings the project represents (road/bridge wear and tear avoided, infrastructure construction or expansion deferred).
              (iii) Timeliness factor. Is the project on track for the point at which the enterprise is projected to attain self-sufficiency? For example, if the project was anticipated to attain self-sufficiency after 36 months of operation, is it on track at the point of evaluation to meet that objective? This can be determined by assessing revenues, cargo and passenger trends, expenses and other factors established in the application review process.
              (i) Can a Project designation expire or be terminated? (1) Project Designations are effective for a period of five years, or until the date the project is completed, or MARAD cancels the designation. Project Designation will expire after three years of inactivity.
              (2) Project Applicants wishing to extend a Project Designation must submit an updated application no later than six months before the five-year designation period ends. Project Applicants who no longer wish to maintain project designation may submit a request to the Secretary to revoke their designation.

            § 401.220
            Registration of pilots.
            (a) The Director shall determine the number of pilots required to be registered in order to assure adequate and efficient pilotage service in the United States waters of the Great Lakes and to provide for equitable participation of United States Registered Pilots with Canadian Registered Pilots in the rendering of pilotage services. The Director determines the number of pilots needed as follows:
            (1) The Director determines the base number of pilots needed by dividing each area's peak pilotage demand data by its pilot work cycle. The pilot work cycle standard includes any time that the Director finds to be a necessary and reasonable component of ensuring that a pilotage assignment is carried out safely, efficiently, and reliably for each area. These components may include, but are not limited to—
            (i) Amount of time a pilot provides pilotage service or is available to a vessel's master to provide pilotage service;
            (ii) Pilot travel time, measured from the pilot's base, to and from an assignment's starting and ending points;
            (iii) Assignment delays and detentions;
            (iv) Administrative time for a pilot who serves as a pilotage association's president;
            (v) Rest between assignments, as required by § 401.451;
            (vi) Ten days' recuperative rest per month from April 15 through November 15 each year, provided that lesser rest allowances are approved by the Director at the pilotage association's request, if necessary to provide pilotage without interruption through that period; and
            (vii) Pilotage-related training.
            (2) Pilotage demand and the base seasonal work standard are based on available and reliable data, as so deemed by the Director, for a multi-year base period. The multi-year period is the 10 most recent full shipping seasons, and the data source is a system approved under 46 CFR 403.300. Where such data are not available or reliable, the Director also may use data, from additional past full shipping seasons or other sources, that the Director determines to be available and reliable.
            (3) The number of pilots needed in each district is calculated by totaling the area results by district and rounding them to the nearest whole integer. For supportable circumstances, the Director may make reasonable and necessary adjustments to the rounded result to provide for changes that the Director anticipates will affect the need for pilots in the district over the period for which base rates are being established.
            (b) Registration of pilots shall be made from among those Applicant Pilots who have (1) completed the minimum number of trips prescribed by the Commandant over the waters for which application is made on oceangoing vessels, in company with a Registered Pilot, within 1 year of date of application, (2) completed a course of instruction for Applicant Pilots prescribed by the association authorized to establish the pilotage pool, (3) satisfactorily completed a written examination prescribed by the Commandant, evidencing his knowledge and understanding of the Great Lakes Pilotage Regulations, Rules and Orders; the Memorandum of Arrangements, Great Lakes Pilotage, between the United States and Canada; and other related matters including the working rules and operating procedures of his district, given at such time and place as the Commandant may designate within the pilotage district of the Applicant Pilot.
            (c) The Pilot Association authorized to establish a pool in which an Applicant Pilot has qualified for registration under paragraph (b) of this section shall submit to the Director in writing its recommendations together with its reasons for the registration of the Applicant.

            (d) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, a pilot found to be qualified under this subpart shall be issued a Certificate of Registration, valid for a term of five (5) years or until the expiration of his master's, mate's or pilot's endorsement issued under the authority of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes or until the pilot reaches age 70, whichever occurs first.
            
            (e) The Director may, when necessary to assure adequate and efficient pilotage service, issue a temporary certificate of registration for a period of less than 1 year to any person found qualified under this subpart regardless of age.

            (a) A Certificate of Registration shall describe the part or parts of the Great Lakes within which the pilot is authorized to perform pilotage services and such description shall not be inconsistent with the terms of the pilotage authorization in his or her master's, mate's, or pilot's endorsement issued under the authority of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes.
            (b) A Certificate of Registration shall not authorize the holder to board any vessel, or to serve as a pilot of any vessel, without the permission of the owner or master. A Certificate of Registration shall be in the possession of a pilot at all times when he or she is in the service of a vessel, and shall be displayed upon demand of the owner or master, any United States Coast Guard officer or inspector, or a representative of the Director.
            (c) A Certificate of Registration evidencing registration of the holder is the property of the U.S. Coast Guard and it shall not be pledged, deposited, or surrendered to any person except as authorized by this part. A Certificate of Registration may not be photostated or copied. A Certificate which has expired without renewal, or renewal of which has been denied under the provisions of this section, shall be surrendered to the Director upon demand.
            (d) An application for a replacement of a lost, damaged, or defaced Certificate of Registration shall be made in writing to the Director together with two full-face photographs, 11/2 inches by 2 inches, signed on the face. A replacement fee of five dollars ($5) by check or money order, drawn to the order of the U.S. Coast Guard, shall accompany any such application. A Certificate issued as a replacement for a lost, damaged, or defaced Certificate shall be marked so as to indicate that it is a replacement. Upon receipt of a Certificate issued as a replacement, the damaged or defaced Certificate shall be surrendered to the Director.
            (e) A Certificate of Registration may be voluntarily surrendered to the Director by a Registered Pilot at any time such pilot no longer desires to perform pilotage services; however, in the event such Registered Pilot has been served with a notice of hearing pursuant to § 401.250, a voluntary surrender of the Certificate of Registration shall be at the option of the Director.

The form for renewal of Certificates of Registration may be obtained from the Director. A renewal fee of 5 dollars by check or money order, drawn to the order of the U.S. Coast Guard, shall accompany an application for renewal of registration, which will be refunded if registration is not renewed. Failure of a Registered Pilot to comply with these requirements or file a complete and sufficient application may constitute cause for denying renewal of the Certificate of Registration.

            (b) No Certificate of Registration shall be renewed unless the applicant for renewal thereof meets the requirements and qualifications set forth in § 401.210 for issuance of an original Certificate of Registration; excepting that compliance with § 401.210(a)(4) shall not be required if the examination was satisfactorily passed on a previous application for registration within six (6) months next preceding the date of application for renewal.
            (c) If the Director determines that there is good cause for denying renewal of a Certificate of Registration, the applicant shall be notified in writing of such determination and the cause thereof. The applicant may thereupon apply within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such notice for a hearing in regard to the cause for the denying of a renewal of the Certificate, which hearing shall be granted.
            (d) In any case in which the applicant has made timely and sufficient application for renewal of his registration, no such registration shall expire until such application shall have been finally determined by the Commandant unless the public health, interest, or safety requires otherwise.
            (e) Upon receipt of a renewal Certificate of Registration, the expired Certificate shall be surrendered to the Director.

            § 401.510
            Operation without Registered Pilots.
            (a) A vessel may be navigated in the U.S. waters of the Great Lakes without a United States or Canadian Registered Pilot when the vessel or its cargo is in distress or jeopardy.
            (b) A vessel may be navigated in the U.S. waters of the Great Lakes without a United States or Canadian Registered Pilot when the Director, with the concurrence of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District, notifies the master that a United States or Canadian Registered Pilot is not available.

            (1) Notification to the master that a pilot is not available will be made by the Director, either directly to the vessel or through the appropriate pilotage pool, orally or in writing as the circumstances admit, and shall not be deemed given until the notice is actually received by the vessel.
            (2) The determination that a pilot is not available will be made on an individual basis and only when a vessel has given proper notice of its pilotage service requirements to the pilotage pool having dispatching jurisdiction at the time. The vessel has no obligation or responsibility with respect to such notification other than properly informing the pilotage pool of its pilotage requirements. However, the failure or delay by the pool in processing a pilotage service request, or refusal or delay by the U.S. Coast Guard in notifying the vessel that a pilot is not available, does not constitute constructive notice that a pilot is not available, and the vessel is not relieved by such failure or delay from compliance with the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960.
            (3) Upon receipt of proper notice of a vessel's pilotage requirements, the pilotage pool shall then determine from the tour de role the availability of a pilot to render the service required. If no pilot is reasonably expected to be available for service within 6 hours of the time the pilotage services are required by the vessel, the pilotage pool shall promptly inform the Commandant through the U.S. Coast Guard communications system in the manner as may be prescribed from time to time by the Commandant. The Commandant shall be informed of:
            (i) Name and flag of the vessel;
            (ii) Route of vessel for which a pilot is not available;
            (iii) Time elapsing before a pilot is reasonably expected to become available;
            (iv) Whether vessel has an “other officer” on board;
            (v) Familiarity of master with route to be transited by the vessel;
            (vi) Draft of vessel; and
            (vii) Any circumstances of traffic or weather, or condition of the vessel or its cargo which would adversely affect the safety of the vessel in transiting without a pilot.
            (4) When a pilot is expected to become available within 6 hours of the time pilot services are required, the vessel shall be informed that a pilot is available and the approximate time the pilot will report on duty. However, should any unusual circumstance or condition exist which may justify notification that a pilot is not available in less than 6 hours, the pilotage pool shall inform the Director as in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, along with the circumstances involved. Additionally, the vessel may contact the Director directly to request notification under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if a notice of pilot availability is not received from the appropriate pilotage pool within two hours of providing its pilotage requirements to the pool.
            (5) Any vessel which requires the services of a pilot and is navigated without a pilot or proceeds prior to receipt of a message that a pilot is not available pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be reported as in violation of section 7 of the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960 by the pilotage pool to the local Coast Guard unit having jurisdiction. If the message is received after the vessel proceeds, such message shall not be delivered without concurrence of the Coast Guard officer to whom the violation was reported.
            (6) U.S. pilotage pools informing the Director that a pilot is not available for a vessel shall also obtain notice that a pilot is not available from the appropriate Canadian Supervisor of Pilots for those portions of the route which are in Canadian waters in the manner prescribed by them. The notice for Canadian District No. 1 waters shall be obtained from the Supervisor of Pilots, Department of Transport, Cornwall, Ontario, and the notice for Canadian District No. 2 waters shall be obtained from the Supervisor of Pilots, Department of Transport, Port Weller, Ontario. Authority to issue notice for Canadian waters of District No. 3 has been granted to the Director by the Department of Transport, Ottawa, and separate notice from Canada for this District is not required until such time as separate Canadian pilotage dispatch facilities may be established.

            (7) Notice that a pilot is not available shall not be delivered to any vessel unless the message contains the concurrence of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District, and notice for Canadian waters of Districts No. 1 and No. 2, if required, has been obtained from the appropriate Canadian authority.
            
            (8) In the event of an emergency or any other compelling circumstance, the Director may issue, without the specific request for service as provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, individual or general notification that a pilot or pilots are not available. Pilotage pools shall advise the Director of any condition or circumstance coming to their attention which may warrant such a determination.

A pilot failing to notify the Director within the prescribed period is deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing.

            Requirements and qualifications for registration.
            (a) Pursuant to § 401.210(a)(4), each applicant for an original registration at the time of application and each Registered Pilot annually is required to pass a physical examination given by a licensed medical doctor and reported on the form furnished by the Director. The examination report shall describe the applicant's or Registered Pilot's visual acuity, color sense, physical condition, and competency to perform the duties of a U.S. Registered Pilot.

            (b) Any disease, physical or mental defect, or impairment to hearing or visual acuity, such as epilepsy, insanity, senility, acute venereal disease, neurosyphilis, hemiplegia, paralysis or missing arm, leg, or eye, muteness or pronounced speech impairment, acute kidney or gastro-enteritis disease, extreme obesity, addiction of alcohol or narcotics, acute varicosity of the legs, cardiovascular disease or other disorder which would impair the applicant's ability to be available for service when required and to withstand the rigors of boarding vessels, climbing ladders or great heights, standing for long periods of time, and performing his duties under prolonged periods of nervous strain are causes for determination of physical incompetency.
            (c) An applicant for original registration must have a visual acuity either with or without glasses of at least 20/20 vision in one eye and at least 20/40 in the other. An applicant who wears glasses or contact lenses must also pass a test without glasses or lens of at least 20/40 in one eye and at least 20/70 in the other. Registered Pilots, however, must have either with or without glasses or lens visual acuity of at least 20/30 in one eye and at least 20/50 in the other. A Registered Pilot who wears glasses or lens must also pass a test without glasses or lens of at least 20/50 in one eye and at least 20/100 in the other. The color sense of original applicants and Registered Pilots shall be tested by a pseudoisochromatic plate test. Passage of the Williams lantern test or its equivalent is an acceptable substitute for a pseudoisochromatic plate test.

          § 404.1
          General ratemaking provisions.
          (a) The goal of ratemaking is to promote safe, efficient, and reliable pilotage service on the Great Lakes, by generating for each pilotage association sufficient revenue to reimburse its necessary and reasonable operating expenses, fairly compensate trained and rested pilots, and provide an appropriate profit to use for improvements.
          (b) Annual reviews of pilotage association expenses and revenue will be conducted in conjunction with an independent party, and data from completed reviews will be used in ratemaking under this part.
          (c) Full ratemakings to establish multi-year base rates and interim year reviews and adjustments will be conducted in accordance with § 404.100 of this part.
        
        
          § 404.2
          Procedure and criteria for recognizing association expenses.
          (a) A pilotage association must report each expense item for which it seeks reimbursement through the charging of pilotage rates, and make supporting information available to the Director. The Director must recognize the item as both necessary for providing pilotage service, and reasonable as to its amount when compared to similar expenses paid by others in the maritime or other comparable industry, or when compared with Internal Revenue Service guidelines. The association will be given an opportunity to contest any preliminary determination that a reported item should not be recognized.
          (b) The Director applies the following criteria to recognize an expense item as necessary and reasonable within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section:
          (1) Operating or capital lease costs. Conformity to market rates, or in the absence of a comparable market, conformity to depreciation plus an allowance for return on investment, computed as if the asset had been purchased with equity capital.
          (2) Return-on-investment. A market equivalent return-on-investment is allowed for the net capital invested in the association by its members, if that investment is necessary for providing pilotage service.
          (3) Transactions not directly related to providing pilotage services. Revenues and expenses generated from these transactions are included in ratemaking calculations as long as the revenues exceed the expenses. If these transactions adversely affect providing pilotage services, the Director may make rate adjustments or take other steps to ensure pilotage service is provided.
          (4) Pilot benefits. Association-paid benefits, including medical and pension benefits and profit sharing, are treated as pilot compensation.
          (5) Profit sharing for non-pilot association employees. These association expenses are recognizable.
          (c) The Director does not recognize the following expense items as necessary and reasonable within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section:
          (1) Unreported or undocumented expenses, and expenses that are not reasonable in their amounts or not reasonably related to providing safe, efficient, and reliable pilotage service;
          (2) Revenues and expenses from Canadian pilots that are commingled with revenues and expenses from U.S. pilots;
          (3) Lobbying expenses; or
          (4) Expenses for personal matters.

          § 404.100
          Ratemaking and annual reviews in general.
          (a) The Director establishes base pilotage rates by a full ratemaking pursuant to §§ 404.101 through 404.110, which is conducted at least once every 5 years and completed by March 1 of the first year for which the base rates will be in effect. Base rates will be set to meet the goal specified in § 404.1(a).
          (b) In the interim years preceding the next scheduled full rate review, the Director will adjust base pilotage rates by an interim ratemaking pursuant to §§ 404.101 through 404.110.
          (c) Each year, the Director will announce whether the Coast Guard will conduct a full ratemaking or interim ratemaking procedure.

          § 404.101
          Ratemaking step 1: Recognize previous operating expenses.
          The Director uses an independent third party to review each pilotage association's expenses, as reported and audited for the last full year for which figures are available, and determines which expense items to recognize for base ratemaking purposes in accordance with § 404.2 of this part.
        
        
          § 404.102
          Ratemaking step 2: Project operating expenses, adjusting for inflation or deflation.
          The Director projects the base year's non-compensation operating expenses for each pilotage association, using recognized operating expense items from § 404.101. Recognized operating expense items subject to inflation or deflation factors are adjusted for those factors based on the subsequent year's U.S. government consumer price index data for the Midwest, projected through the year in which the new base rates take effect, or if that is unavailable, the Federal Open Market Committee median economic projections for Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation.

          § 404.103
          Ratemaking step 3: Estimate number of working pilots.
          The Director projects, based on the number of persons applying under 46 CFR part 401 to become U.S. Great Lakes registered pilots, and on information provided by the district's pilotage association, the number of pilots expected to be fully working and compensated.

          § 404.104
          Ratemaking step 4: Determine target pilot compensation benchmark.
          (a) In a full ratemaking year, the Director determines base individual target pilot compensation using a compensation benchmark, set after considering the most relevant currently available non-proprietary information. For supportable circumstances, the Director may make necessary and reasonable adjustments to the benchmark.
          (b) In an interim year, the Director adjusts the previous year's individual target pilot compensation level by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Cost Index for the Transportation and Materials sector, or if that is unavailable, the Federal Open Market Committee median economic projections for Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation.
          (c) The Director determines each pilotage association's total target pilot compensation by multiplying individual target pilot compensation computed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section by the number of pilots projected under § 404.103 or § 401.220(a) of this chapter, whichever is lower.

          § 404.105
          Ratemaking step 5: Project working capital fund.

          The Director calculates each pilotage association's allowed base working capital fund by adding the projected adjusted operating expenses from § 404.102 and the total target pilot compensation from § 404.104 of this part, multiplied by the preceding year's average annual rate of return for new issues of high grade corporate securities.

          § 404.106
          Ratemaking step 6: Project needed revenue.
          The Director calculates each pilotage association's base projected needed revenue by adding the projected adjusted operating expenses from § 404.102 of this part, the total target pilot compensation from § 404.104 of this part, and the projected return on investment from § 404.105 of this part.
        
        
          § 404.107
          Ratemaking step 7: Calculate initial base rates.
          (a) The Director calculates initial base hourly rates by dividing the projected needed revenue from § 404.106 by averages of past hours worked in each district's designated and undesignated waters, using available and reliable data for a multi-year period set in accordance with § 401.220(a) of this chapter.

          § 404.108
          Ratemaking step 8: Calculate average weighting factors by Area.
          The Director calculates the average weighting factor for each area by computing the 10-year rolling average of weighting factors applied in that area, beginning with the year 2014. If less than 10 years of data are available, the Director calculates the average weighting factor using data from each year beginning with 2014.

          § 404.109
          Ratemaking step 9: Calculate revised base rates.
          The Director calculates revised base rates for each area by dividing the initial base rate (from Step 7) by the average weighting factor (from Step 8) to produce a revised base rate for each area.

          § 404.110
          Ratemaking step 10: Review and finalize rates.
          The Director reviews the base pilotage rates calculated in § 404.109 of this part to ensure they meet the goal set in § 404.1(a) of this part, and either finalizes them or first makes necessary and reasonable adjustments to them based on requirements of Great Lakes pilotage agreements between the United States and Canada, or other supportable circumstances.
