      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General flow of functions.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, has final authority with respect to the functions described in § 1.01-15(b) of this subpart, subject to the rights of appeal set forth in subpart 1.03 of this part.<PRTPAGE P="11"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b)(1) The general course and method by which the functions (other than those dealing with suspension and revocation of credentials described in paragraph (c) of this section) concerning marine safety activities are channeled, begins with the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, at the local Sector Office. From this Officer the course is to the Chief, Marine Safety Division, on the staff of the District Commander, and then to the District Commander. From the District Commander, the course is to the Chief of one of the offices with the Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy at Headquarters.</P>
              <P>(2) For Activities Europe, the course is from the Officer in Charge, Activities Europe to the staff of the Atlantic Area Commander, then to the Atlantic Area Commander, and then to the Chief of one of the offices with the Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy at Headquarters.</P>
              <P>(c) In proceedings involving the suspension or revocation of a Coast Guard credential issued to an individual, the course and method by which such proceedings are channeled are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) In the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Territory of Guam, the Virgin Islands, and other possessions, the proceedings are initiated by the issuance of a complaint against the holder of the Coast Guard credential. A Coast Guard Investigating Officer, as defined in 46 CFR 5.15, causes the complaint to be served on the person described therein (respondent) who is a holder of a Coast Guard credential. At a hearing the Coast Guard submits evidence to support the allegations of the complaint, while the respondent may submit evidence in rebuttal or mitigation. The Administrative Law Judge renders a decision on the basis of the evidence adduced at the hearing and the law. The Administrative Law Judge's decision is given to the respondent.</P>
              <P>(i) In a case where an appeal is made by either party (Coast Guard or respondent), the notice of appeal is filed in accordance with the procedures of 33 CFR 20.1001(a).</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(d) In the performance of their duties, all Coast Guard Administrative Law Judges are bound by law and the regulations in this chapter or in 33 CFR chapter I. Statements of policy, clarification of points of procedure, and general administrative instructions are published in <E T="03">Administrative Law Judges' Circulars</E> and <E T="03">Administrative Law Judges' Internal Practices and Procedures Series.</E> The Chief Administrative Law Judge, located in the Office of the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, maintains a complete file of these publications for reading purposes during normal working hours.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Annual vessel inspection fee.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) Unless otherwise provided by this subpart, each vessel required to have a Certificate of Inspection is subject to the annual vessel inspection fee listed in table 2.10-101 for its vessel category.</P>
              <P>(2) A vessel certificated for more than one service must pay only the higher of the two applicable fees in table 2.10-101 of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The vessel owner or operator must pay the annual vessel inspection fee each year on or before the vessel's user fee anniversary date, unless the fee has been prepaid under § 2.10-105 of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(c) Payment of the annual vessel inspection fee entitles a vessel to all inspection services related to compliance <PRTPAGE P="34"/>with its Certificate of Inspection, including but not limited to the inspection for renewal of the Certificate of Inspection, reinspections (annual and periodic inspections), hull (drydock) inspections, deficiency inspections, damage surveys, repair and modification inspections, change in vessel service inspections, permit to proceed inspections, drydock extension inspections, and all inspections required for the issuance of international certificates.</P>
              <P>(d) Entitlement to inspection services for the current year remains with the vessel if it is sold. The entitlement to inspection services may not be transferred to any other vessel.</P>

              <P>(a) Certain navigation and vessel inspection laws, or regulations in this chapter or in 33 CFR chapter I, require the Commandant's approval before specific types of safety equipment, materials, or installations may be installed or used on vessels subject to Coast Guard inspection, or on other described vessels, motorboats, artificial islands, and fixed structures.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commandant's approvals are issued to persons, partnerships, companies, or corporations who offer for sale specific items of safety equipment, materials, or installations, or intend them for their own or others' use. These approvals are intended to provide a control over the quality of such approved items. The Commandant's approvals apply only to those items constructed or installed in accordance with applicable requirements, and the details as described in the documents granting specific approval. If a specific item when manufactured does not comply with these details, then it is not considered to be approved and the approval issued does not apply to such modified item. For example, if an item is manufactured with changes in design or material not previously approved, the approval does not apply to such modified item. The failure to comply with applicable requirements and details specified in the approval subjects the holder to immediate suspension of approval as described in § 2.75-40, and if necessary, to a public hearing seeking withdrawal of approval and removal of all such items from use or installation as provided in § 2.75-50.</P>

              <P>(c) The Commandant's approvals are issued to qualified holders in the form of certificates of approval (Form CGHQ-10030), by appropriate description and identification in documents filed with the Office of the Federal Register and published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> or by letters, or by appropriate markings on drawings, plans, etc. Under the direction of the Commandant, the Deputy for Operations Policy and Capabilities (CG-DCO-D) is delegated the authority to exercise the necessary actions relating to the granting, suspension, cancellation or revocation of approvals for special items of safety equipment, materials or installations required by law in regulation in this chapter or in 33 CFR chapter I to have the Commandant's approval. The authority delegated to the Deputy for Operations Policy and Capabilities (CG-DCO-D) may be further delegated by him.</P>

              <P>(d) The approvals granted to holders qualifying under the regulations in this chapter or in specifications, copies of which may be obtained from the Commandant (CG-ENG), and to which official Coast Guard numbers are assigned, <PRTPAGE P="40"/>will be in the form of certificates of approval. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the approval shall be valid for a period of five years from the date on the certificate of approval, but subject to suspension and/or cancellation if it is found the item offered, sold, or used as Coast Guard approved differs in any detail from the item as described in the certificate of approval and referenced material.</P>
              <P>(e) A specific Commandant's approval granted to anyone, which is described in a certificate of approval, or a letter, or marked plans, etc., cannot be transferred to another without a specific prior authorization from the Commandant. Such a transfer without the Commandant's authorization normally terminates such approval.</P>

              <P>(f) A listing of current and formerly approved equipment and materials may be found on the internet at: <E T="03">http://cgmix.uscg.mil/equipment.</E> Each OCMI may be contacted for information concerning approved equipment.</P>

              <P>(b) The order is directed against all credentials or endorsements, except that in cases of negligence or professional incompetence, the order is made applicable to specific credentials or endorsements. If the Administrative Law Judge determines that the respondent is professionally incompetent in the grade of the license, certificate or document held, but is considered competent in a lower grade, the credential or endorsement may be revoked and the issuance of one of a lower grade ordered.</P>

              <P>(a) This section addresses orders in a general manner. The selection of an appropriate order is the responsibility of the Administrative Law Judge, subject to appeal and review. The investigating officer and the respondent may suggest an order and present argument in support of this suggestion during the presentation of aggravating or mitigating evidence.</P>
              <P>(b) Except for acts or offenses for which revocation is mandatory, factors which may affect the order include:</P>
              <P>(1) Remedial actions which have been undertaken independently by the respondent;</P>
              <P>(2) Prior record of the respondent, considering the period of time between prior acts and the act or offense for which presently charged is relevant; and</P>
              <P>(3) Evidence of mitigation or aggravation.</P>
              <P>(c) After an order of revocation is entered, the respondent will be given an opportunity to present relevant material on the record for subsequent consideration by the special board convened in the event an application is filed in accordance with subpart L of this part.</P>

              <P>(d) Table 5.569 is for the information and guidance of Administrative Law Judges and is intended to promote uniformity in orders rendered. This table should not affect the fair and impartial adjudication of each case on its individual facts and merits. The orders are expressed by a range, in months of outright suspension, considered appropriate for the particular act or offense prior to considering matters in mitigation or aggravation. For instance, without considering other factors, a period of two to four months outright suspension is considered appropriate for <E T="03">failure to obey a master's written instructions.</E> An order within the range would not be considered excessive. Mitigating or aggravating factors may make an order greater or less than the given range appropriate. Orders for repeat offenders will ordinarily be greater than those specified.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Stay of effect of decision and order of Administrative Law Judge on appeal to the Commandant; temporary credential or endorsement.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A person who has appealed from a decision suspending outright or revoking a credential or endorsement, except for revocation resulting from an offense enumerated in § 5.59, may file a written request for a temporary credential or endorsement. This request must be submitted to the Administrative Law Judge who presided over the case, or to any Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection for forwarding to the Administrative Law Judge.</P>
              <P>(b) Action on the request is taken by the ALJ unless the hearing transcript has been forwarded to the Commandant, in which case, the Commandant will make the final action.</P>
              <P>(c) A determination as to the request will take into consideration whether the service of the individual is compatible with the requirements for safety at sea and consistent with applicable laws. If one of the offenses enumerated in § 5.61(a) has been found proved, the continued service of the appellant will be presumed not compatible with safety at sea, subject to rebuttal by the appellant. A temporary credential or endorsement may be denied for that reason alone.</P>
              <P>(d) All temporary credentials or endorsements will provide that they expire not more than six months after issuance or upon service of the Commandant's decision on appeal, whichever occurs first. If a temporary credential or endorsement expires before the Commandant's decision is rendered, it may be renewed, if authorized by the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(e) If the request for a temporary credential or endorsement is denied by the Administrative Law Judge, the individual may appeal the denial, in writing, to the Commandant within 30 days after notification of such denial. Any decision by the Commandant to deny is the final agency action.</P>
              <P>(f) Copies of the temporary credential issued become a part of the record on appeal.</P>

These rules give the party adversely affected by the Commandant's decision 10 days after service upon him or his attorney of the Commandant's decision to file a notice of appeal with the Board.</P>
              <P>(b) In all cases under this part which are appealed to the National Transportation Safety Board under 49 CFR part 825, the Chief Counsel of the Coast Guard is designated as the representative of the Commandant for service of notices and appearances. Communications should be addressed to Commandant (CG-094), Attn: Judge Advocate General (JAG) and Chief Counsel, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7213, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7213.</P>

              <P>(b) A stay of the effect of the Decision of the Commandant on Appeal may be granted by the Commandant upon application by the respondent filed with the notice served on the Commandant under 49 CFR 825.5(b).</P>
              <P>(c) An Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, on presentation of an original stay order, issues a temporary credential and/or endorsement as specified in the stay order.

            <P>(b) An application requesting that a waiver be made effective, with respect to a particular vessel, may be made by any authorized representative of an agency of the United States Government or any other interested person (including the master, agent, or owner of the vessel involved). Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the application shall be in writing. The application shall be delivered to the Coast Guard District Commander or to his designated representative at the port or place where the vessel is located. In the case of a vessel in any foreign port or place, the application shall be made to the designated representative of the Commandant at such port or place, or if the Coast Guard has not established facilities in such port or place, to the nearest designated representative of the Commandant at a port or place where such facilities have been established. Every application shall contain a statement of the particular provisions of law with respect to which waiver of compliance is requested, a certification that the waiver of compliance with such laws with respect to the vessel involved is necessary in the interest of national defense and, an outline of the facts upon which such certification is based. The Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative or the designated representative of the Commandant, as the case may be) shall promptly examine every application for the purpose of determining whether the necessity for prompt action is such as to require that the waiver be made effective by him without reference to the Commandant. In any case in which it appears to the Coast Guard officer concerned that reference of the application to the Commandant for action would not delay the sailing of the vessel or otherwise be contrary to the interest of national defense, the application shall be so referred. In all other cases, such Coast Guard officer shall give immediate consideration to the application and if he reaches the conclusion that the urgency of the situation outweighs the marine hazard involved, then such waiver shall be made effective in regard to such vessel to the extent and under the circumstances specified by him.</P>
            <P>(c) The Coast Guard officer making such a waiver effective pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall immediately prepare, in triplicate, an order setting forth the name of the vessel involved, the laws (also regulations, if any) with respect to which the waiver is effective, the extent to which compliance with such laws (also regulations, if any) is waived, and the period for which the waiver shall be effective. If practicable, one copy of this order shall be delivered to the master of the vessel involved before such vessel sails. In any case where the order is not delivered to the master, it shall be delivered to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel without delay. One copy of the order shall be transmitted to the Commandant and the remaining copy kept on file.</P>
            <P>(d) In any case of extreme urgency the application for a waiver may be made orally, and if the Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative or the designated representative of the Commandant, as the case may be) reaches the conclusion referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, the waiver shall be made effective without further delay, subject to the condition that the application be reduced to writing and delivered within such period after the date of the oral request as the Coast Guard officer making the waiver effective shall specify in the order.</P>

            <P>(e) No penalty shall be imposed because of failure to comply with any provision of law (or regulation, if any), <PRTPAGE P="76"/>the waiver of which has been made effective pursuant to the requirements in this section.</P>

            <P>The rate of extra compensation for authorized overtime services performed at night on any week day is hereby fixed at one half the gross daily rate of regular pay of the employee who performs the services for each 2 hours of compensable time, any fraction of 2 hours amounting to at least one hour to be counted as 2 hours. In computing the amount earned, each 2 hours is the time period for the purpose of computation, at least one hour means the minimum service in each period for which extra pay may be granted. If service continues beyond a 2 hour period, it must extend for at least one hour into the following 2 hour period to be entitled to extra pay for the second period. When the overtime extends beyond 5 p.m., payment of extra compensation from 5 p.m. for services consisting of at least one hour is authorized, even though such services may not actually begin until 7 p.m., 9 p.m., or later: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the officer rendering the service remained on duty from 5 p.m., in which case the time between 5 p.m., and the time of beginning the actual service shall be computed as waiting time; and where the actual services begin as late as 9 p.m., there should be an affirmative statement that the officer was required to remain on duty between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., if a charge for waiting time is made. The maximum amount of extra compensation which may be paid an employee for services during one night shall not exceed two and one-half times the gross daily rate of his regular pay.</P>

This rate shall apply regardless of the <PRTPAGE P="99"/>length of time served within the aggregate of the aforesaid 9 hours, whether it is served continuously or in broken periods, and whether it is served for one or more applicants. Services in excess of an aggregate of the aforesaid 9 hours performed during the 24 hours of a Sunday or holiday shall be compensated on the same basis as overtime services performed at night on a weekday, the time between the completion of the aggregate of the aforesaid 9 hours and midnight being considered as the hours of a night.

              <P>(a) A merchant mariner credential (MMC) (Coast Guard Form CG-4610), is a credential combining the elements of the merchant mariner's document (MMD), merchant mariner's license (license), and certificate of registry (COR) enumerated in 46 U.S.C. subtitle II part E as well as the STCW endorsement issued pursuant to the STCW Convention and STCW Code (incorporated by reference, see § 10.103 of this part). MMDs, licenses, STCW endorsements and CORs are no longer issued as separate documents and all qualifications formerly entered on those separate documents appear in the form of an endorsement(s) on an MMC.</P>
              <P>(b) An MMC authorizes the holder to serve in any capacity endorsed thereon, or in any lower capacity in the same department, or in any capacity covered by a general endorsement.</P>

              <P>(b) An MMC, license, MMD, COR, or STCW endorsement must be retained by the mariner to whom it was issued and, while valid, must be produced to verify qualifications when requested by an authorized official as identified in 33 CFR 101.515(d). Posting of the officer endorsement may be necessary as required in 46 U.S.C. 7110.</P>

              <P>(a) An MMC is valid for a term of 5 years from the date of issuance. Except upon the written request for the immediate issuance by the applicant, the Coast Guard will post-date the issuance of an MMC renewal that includes no other transactions up to 8 months from the date that the Coast Guard accepts a complete application as required in this part. If the expiration date of the mariner's active credential is beyond 8 months of the date that the Coast Guard accepts a complete application as required in this part, the new credential issue date will be 8 months from the date of application acceptance at which time the currently active credential will become invalid in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. Otherwise, the new credential issue validity date will coincide with the expiration date of the active credential held by the mariner. All other MMC transactions will be processed for immediate issuance.</P>
              <P>(b) All endorsements, unless otherwise noted, are valid until the expiration date of the MMC on which they appear.</P>
              <P>(c) A mariner may not serve under the authority of an MMC past its expiration date. An expired MMC may be renewed during an administrative grace period of up to 1 year beyond its expiration date as per § 10.227(h) of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) When an MMC is renewed or re-issued before its expiration date in accordance with § 10.227, of this part the MMC that has been replaced becomes invalid unless otherwise noted in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) An MMC is not valid until signed by the applicant and a duly authorized Coast Guard official.</P>

              <P>(f) A mariner's endorsements authorize the holder to serve in any capacity endorsed on the MMC, or in any lower capacity in the same department, or in <PRTPAGE P="113"/>any capacity covered by a general endorsement thereon.</P>
              <P>(g) If a mariner chooses to renew his or her license, MMD, COR, or STCW endorsement and receive their first MMC, the Coast Guard may also renew all other credentials for which the mariner is qualified.</P>
              <P>(h) When a Document of Continuity is replaced with an MMC re-issued in accordance with § 10.227 of this part, the Document of Continuity that has been replaced becomes invalid.

              <SUBJECT>Criminal record review.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Coast Guard may conduct a criminal record review to determine the safety and suitability of an applicant for an MMC and any endorsements. An applicant conducting simultaneous MMC transactions will undergo a single criminal record review. At the time of application, each applicant must provide written disclosure of all prior convictions not previously disclosed to the Coast Guard on an application.</P>
              <P>(b) A criminal record review is not required for applicants seeking a duplicate MMC under § 10.229.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fingerprints.</E> The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will provide to the Coast Guard the applicant's fingerprints submitted by the applicant with his or her TWIC application and, if applicable, the applicant's FBI number and criminal record generated in the TWIC review process. This information, or the fingerprints taken by the Coast Guard at an REC, will be used by the Coast Guard to determine whether the applicant has a record of any criminal convictions.</P>
              <P>(d) When a criminal record review leads the Coast Guard to determine that an applicant is not a safe and suitable person or cannot be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of the MMC or endorsement applied for, the application may be denied.</P>
              <P>(e) If an application is denied, the applicant will be notified in writing of that fact, the reason or reasons for denial, and advised that the appeal procedures in subpart 1.03 of part 1 of this chapter apply. No examination will be given pending decision on appeal.</P>

              <P>(f) No person who has been convicted of a violation of the dangerous drug laws of the United States, the District of Columbia, any State, territory, or possession of the United States, or a foreign country, by any military or civilian court, is eligible for an MMC, except as provided elsewhere in this section. No person who has ever been the user of, or addicted to the use of a dangerous drug, or has ever been convicted of an offense described in section 205 of the National Driver Register Act of 1982, as amended (49 U.S.C. 30304) because of addiction to or abuse of alcohol is eligible for an MMC, unless he or <PRTPAGE P="115"/>she furnishes satisfactory evidence of suitability for service in the merchant marine as provided in paragraph (l) of this section. A conviction for a drug offense more than 10 years before the date of application will not alone be grounds for denial.</P>
              <P>(g) The Coast Guard will use table 1 to § 10.211 of this section to evaluate applicants who have criminal convictions. The table lists major categories of criminal activity and is not to be construed as an all-inclusive list. If an applicant is convicted of an offense that does not appear on the list, the Coast Guard will establish an appropriate assessment period using the list as a guide. The assessment period commences when an applicant is no longer incarcerated. The applicant must establish proof of the time incarcerated and periods of probation and parole to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard. The assessment period may include supervised or unsupervised probation or parole.</P>

              <P>(h) When an applicant has convictions for more than one offense, the minimum assessment period will be the longest minimum in table 1 to § 10.211 of this section and table 10.213(c) in § 10.213 based upon the applicant's convictions; the maximum assessment period will be the longest shown in table 1 to § 10.211 of this section and table 10.213(c) of § 10.213 based upon the applicant's convictions.</P>
              <P>(i) If a person with a criminal conviction applies before the minimum assessment period shown in table 1 to § 10.211 of this section of this section or established by the Coast Guard under paragraph (g) of this section has elapsed, then the applicant must provide, as part of the application package, evidence of suitability for service in the merchant marine. Factors that are evidence of suitability for service in the merchant marine are listed in paragraph (l) of this section. The Coast Guard will consider the applicant's evidence submitted with the application and may issue the MMC and/or endorsement in less than the listed minimum assessment period if the Coast Guard is satisfied that the applicant is suitable to hold the MMC and/or endorsement for which he or she has applied. If an application filed before the minimum assessment period has elapsed does not include evidence of suitability for service in the merchant marine, then the application will be considered incomplete and will not be processed by the Coast Guard.</P>
              <P>(j) If a person with a criminal conviction submits his or her MMC application during the time between the minimum and maximum assessment periods shown in table 1 to § 10.211 or established by the Coast Guard under paragraph (g) of this section, then the Coast Guard will consider the conviction and, unless there are offsetting factors, will grant the applicant the MMC and/or endorsement for which he or she has applied. Offsetting factors include such factors as multiple convictions, failure to comply with court orders (e.g., child support orders), previous failures at rehabilitation or reform, inability to maintain steady employment, or any connection between the crime and the safe operation of a vessel. If the Coast Guard considers the applicant unsuitable for service in the merchant marine at the time of application, the Coast Guard may deny the application.</P>
              <P>(k) If a person with a criminal conviction submits his or her MMC application after the maximum assessment period shown in table 1 to § 10.211 of this section or established by the Coast Guard under paragraph (g) of this section has elapsed, then the Coast Guard will grant the applicant the MMC or endorsement for which he or she has applied unless the Coast Guard considers the applicant still unsuitable for service in the merchant marine. If the Coast Guard disapproves an applicant with a conviction older than the maximum assessment period listed in table 1 to § 10.211 of this section , the Coast Guard will notify the applicant in writing of the reason(s) for the disapproval. The Coast Guard will also inform the applicant, in writing, that the reconsideration and appeal procedures contained in subpart 1.03 of this chapter apply.</P>
              <P>(l) If an applicant has one or more alcohol or dangerous drug related criminal or NDR-listed convictions, if the applicant has ever been the user of, or addicted to the use of, a dangerous drug, or if the applicant applies before the minimum assessment period has elapsed for his or her conviction, the Coast Guard may consider the following factors, as applicable, in assessing the applicant's suitability to hold an MMC. This list is intended as a guide for the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard may consider other factors appropriate to a particular applicant, such as:</P>

              <P>(b) The Coast Guard will not consider NDR-listed civil convictions that are more than 3 years old from the date of request unless that information relates to a current suspension or revocation of the applicant's license to operate a motor vehicle. The Coast Guard may determine minimum and maximum assessment periods for NDR-listed criminal convictions using table 10.213(c) of this section. An applicant conducting simultaneous MMC transactions is subject to only one NDR check.</P>
              <P>(c) The guidelines in table 1 to paragraph (c) will be used by the Coast Guard in evaluating applicants who have drug or alcohol related NDR-listed convictions. Non-drug or alcohol related NDR-listed convictions will be evaluated by the Coast Guard under table 1 to § 10.211 of this part as applicable. The Coast Guard may consider non-drug or alcohol related NDR-listed convictions that are more than 3 years old from the date of the request when the information relates to a current suspension or revocation of the applicant's license to operate a motor vehicle.</P>

Documents of Continuity do not expire and are issued solely to maintain an individual's eligibility for renewal. A Document of Continuity does not entitle an individual to serve as a merchant mariner. A holder of a Document of Continuity may obtain a properly endorsed, valid MMC at any time by satisfying the requirements for renewal as provided in paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section as applicable. When a valid MMC is issued to replace a previously held Document of Continuity, the previously issued Document of Continuity becomes void.</P>
              <P>(2) Applications for a Document of Continuity must include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The endorsements to be placed into continuity.</P>
              <P>(ii) An application including a signed statement from the applicant attesting to an awareness of the limited purpose of the Document of Continuity, his or her inability to serve, and the requirements to obtain an MMC.</P>
              <P>(3) If not all MMC endorsements are to be converted into a Document of Continuity, a new MMC will be issued with the active endorsements. Once the new MMC and/or Document of Continuity is issued the previous MMC is no longer valid and must be returned to the Coast Guard.</P>
              <P>(4) STCW endorsements may not be placed in continuity. If an individual continues to maintain a valid MMC while placing specific national endorsements into continuity, those STCW endorsements associated with the national endorsements that were placed in continuity are no longer valid.</P>
              <P>(5) No credential expired beyond the 12-month administrative grace period in paragraph (h) of this section can be converted into a Document of Continuity.</P>
              <P>(6) A holder of a Document of Continuity may obtain a properly endorsed, valid MMC, including STCW endorsements, at any time by satisfying the requirements for renewal as provided in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Administrative grace period.</E> A credential may be renewed up to 12 months after expiration. For a credential to be re-issued by the Coast Guard more than 12 months after its expiration, an applicant must comply with the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section. When an applicant's credential expires during a time of service with the Armed Forces and there is no reasonable opportunity for renewal, including by mail, this period may be extended. The period of military service following the date of expiration which precluded renewal may be added to the 12-month grace period. The 12-month grace period and any extensions do not affect the expiration date of the credential. A license, MMD, COR, STCW <PRTPAGE P="125"/>endorsement, MMC, and any endorsements thereon, are not valid for use after the expiration date.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Re-issuance of expired credentials.</E> (1) If an applicant applies for re-issuance of an endorsement as deck officer, engineer officer, or qualified rating more than 12 months after its expiration, instead of the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, the applicant must demonstrate continued professional knowledge by completing a course approved for this purpose, or by passing the complete examination for original issue of the endorsement. The examination may be oral-assisted if the expired credential was awarded based on the results of an oral exam. The fees set forth in § 10.219 of this part apply to these examinations. In the case of an expired radio officer's endorsement, the endorsement may be issued upon presentation of a valid first- or second-class radiotelegraph operator license issued by the Federal Communications Commission.</P>
              <P>(2) An endorsement for chief purser, purser, senior assistant purser, junior assistant purser, hospital corpsman, marine physician assistant, medical doctor, or professional nurse that has been expired for more than 12 months must be renewed in the same way as a current endorsement of that type. There are no additional requirements for re-issuing endorsements for chief purser, purser, senior assistant purser, junior assistant purser, hospital corpsman, marine physician assistant, medical doctor, or professional nurse that have been expired for more than 12 months.</P>
              <P>(3) Applicants applying for re-issuance of an endorsement as master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels more than 12 months after expiration of the previous endorsement must complete the practical demonstration of maneuvering and handling a towing vessel required under (e)(6)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Applicants applying for re-issuance of an endorsement as any tankerman rating more than 12 months after expiration of the previous endorsement must meet the requirements in § 13.117 of this subchapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requirements for raises of grade or new endorsements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section applies to applicants who already hold a valid credential and want to make either of the following transactions:</P>
              <P>(1) Add a new endorsement.</P>
              <P>(2) Obtain a raise of grade of an existing endorsement.</P>

              <P>(b) If an applicant for new endorsement or raise of grade meets the renewal requirements under § 10.227 of this subpart for every endorsement <PRTPAGE P="126"/>listed on the MMC and requests renewal, the applicant will receive a credential valid for 5 years. When an applicant does not meet the renewal requirements for every endorsement held, the applicant's new endorsement will be issued with the expiration date that is the same as the current MMC.</P>
              <P>(c) A complete application for a new endorsement or raise of grade must contain the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A completed, signed application.</P>
              <P>(2) Proof that the mariner either holds a valid TWIC or has applied for a TWIC.</P>
              <P>(3) All supplementary materials required to show that the mariner meets the mandatory requirements for the new endorsements sought as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The mandatory requirements for officer endorsements as contained in part 11 of this subchapter and paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The mandatory requirements for rating endorsements as contained in part 12 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(iii) The mandatory requirements for tankerman rating endorsements are contained in part 13 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(iv) The mandatory requirements for STCW endorsements as contained in parts 11, 12, and 13 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(4) The appropriate fee as contained in § 10.219 of this part.</P>
              <P>(5) Any uncanceled MMD, MMC, license, STCW endorsement, or COR held by the applicant. If one or more of these credentials are still valid at the time of application, a photocopy—front, back, and all attachments—will satisfy this requirement.</P>
              <P>(6) Applicants for the following endorsements must produce evidence of having passed a chemical test for dangerous drugs or of qualifying for an exemption from testing in § 16.220 of this subchapter:</P>
              <P>(i) Any officer endorsement.</P>
              <P>(ii) The first endorsement as able seaman, lifeboatman, lifeboatman-limited, qualified member of the engine department, or tankerman.</P>
              <P>(7) Where sea service is required, documentary evidence in accordance with § 10.232 of this part.</P>
              <P>(8) Applicants seeking a new endorsement must either hold an unexpired medical certificate or submit a medical certificate application.</P>
              <P>(9) Consent to a Coast Guard check for offenses described in section 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the National Driver Register Act of 1982, as amended.</P>
              <P>(d) Additional requirements for an applicant seeking a raise of grade of an officer endorsement are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Sea service acquired before the issuance of an officer endorsement is generally not accepted as any part of the service required for a raise of grade of that endorsement. However, service acquired before issuance of an officer endorsement will be accepted for certain crossovers, endorsements, or increases in scope of an MMC, as appropriate. In the limited tonnage categories for deck officers, total accumulated service is a necessary criterion for most raises of grade; therefore, service acquired before the issuance of such officer endorsements will be accepted.</P>
              <P>(2) An applicant remains eligible for a raise of grade while on probation as a result of action under part 5 of this chapter. A raise of grade issued to a person on probation will be subject to the same probationary conditions imposed against his or her other credentials. The offense for which he or she was placed on probation will be considered on the merits of the case in determining fitness to hold the endorsement applied for. No applicant will be examined for a raise of grade during any period when a suspension without probation or a revocation imposed under part 5 of this chapter is effective against his or her credential or while an appeal from these actions is pending.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Professional examination.</E> (i) When the Coast Guard finds an applicant's experience and training for raise of grade is satisfactory, and the applicant is eligible in all other respects, the Coast Guard will authorize a professional examination.</P>
              <P>(ii) Oral-assisted examinations may be administered in accordance with § 11.201(j) of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(iii) The general instructions for administration of examinations and the lists of subjects for all endorsements are found in part 11, subpart I; part 12, subpart E; and part 13, subpart A of this subchapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sea service.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Documenting sea service.</E> (1) Sea service may be documented in various forms such as certificates of discharge, pilotage service and billing forms, and service letters or other official documents from marine companies signed by the owner, operator, master, or chief engineer of the vessel. The Coast Guard must be satisfied as to the authenticity and acceptability of all evidence of experience or training presented.</P>
              <P>(2) Documentary evidence produced by the applicant, unless in the form of a Certificate of Discharge conforming to § 14.307 of this subchapter, must contain all of the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) Vessel name(s) and official numbers listed on the registration, certificate, or document issued.</P>
              <P>(ii) Gross tonnage of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(iii) Propulsion power and mode of propulsion of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(iv) The amount and nature (e.g. chief mate, assistant engineer, etc.) of the applicant's experience.</P>
              <P>(v) Applicable dates of service for each vessel, and the ports or terminals if applicable.</P>
              <P>(vi) The routes upon which the experience was acquired.</P>
              <P>(vii) For those seeking to renew a radar observer endorsement, whether the vessel is equipped with radar and if the mariner served in a position that routinely uses radar for navigation and collision avoidance purposes.</P>
              <P>(viii) For those seeking service credit on towing vessels in accordance with § 11.211(e) of this subchapter, the aggregate tonnage of the tug and barges during the mariner's service.</P>
              <P>(ix) Any other information necessary to determine the applicability of STCW to the vessel.</P>
              <P>(x) Whether the vessel is manned and equipped in accordance with SOLAS.</P>
              <P>(xi) Where required for an officer endorsement, time served as bridge watchkeeping or engine watchkeeping duties under the supervision of a qualified officer.</P>
              <P>(3) An MMC endorsement, in certain cases, may be considered as satisfactory evidence of any qualifying experience for obtaining other endorsements.</P>
              <P>(4) For service on vessels of less than 200 GRT, owners of vessels may attest to their own service and provide proof of ownership. Those who do not own a vessel must obtain letters or other evidence from licensed personnel or the owners of the vessels listed.</P>
              <P>(5) If the required sea service is associated with watchkeeping functions and the performance of duties, as required in §§ 11.323, 11.329, and 11.333, the service must be documented as having been carried out under the direct supervision of the appropriate person. If the required sea service is associated with the performance of duties, as required in §§ 11.470, 11.472, and 11.474, the service must be documented as having been carried out under the supervision of the appropriate person.</P>
              <P>(6) An applicant who has been acting as a pilot may submit a letter from a pilot's association attesting to the applicant's sea service. For those pilots seeking to renew a radar observer endorsement, the association's letter should indicate that the vessels piloted were equipped with radar, and that radar was used by the pilot for navigation and collision avoidance purposes. Pilots not part of an association may submit other relevant records indicating service, such as billing forms. For a raise-of-grade, pilots must comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Service toward an oceans, near-coastal, or STCW endorsement will be credited as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Service on the Great Lakes will be credited on a day-for-day basis up to 100 percent of the total required service.</P>
              <P>(2) Service on inland waters, other than Great Lakes, that are navigable waters of the United States, will be credited on a day-for-day basis for up to 50 percent of the total required service.</P>

              <P>(3) Service on vessels to which STCW applies, whether inland or coastwise, will be credited on a day-for-day basis. For establishing credit for sea service, the waters of the Inside Passage between Puget Sound and Cape Spencer, Alaska will be credited for a near-coastal and STCW endorsement.<PRTPAGE P="128"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) Service toward a near-coastal or a Great Lakes endorsement will be credited on a day-for-day basis and in accordance with the individual requirements for the specific credential.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Sea service as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States and civilian service on vessels owned by the United States as required experience.</E> (1) Sea service as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States will be accepted as required experience for an original, raise of grade, renewal, or increase in scope of all endorsements. In most cases, military sea service will have been performed upon ocean waters; however, inland service, as may be the case on smaller vessels, will be credited in the same manner as conventional evaluations. The applicant must submit an official transcript of sea service or history of assignments as verification of the service claimed when the application is submitted. A DD-214 is not acceptable evidence of sea service. The applicant must also provide the Coast Guard with other necessary information as to tonnage, routes, propulsion power, percentage of time underway, and assigned duties upon the vessels on which he or she served. Such service will be evaluated by the Coast Guard for a determination of its equivalence to sea service acquired on merchant vessels and the appropriate grade, class, and limit of endorsement for which the applicant is eligible. Normally, 60 percent of the total time onboard is considered equivalent underway service; however, the periods of operation of each vessel may be evaluated separately. In order to be eligible for a master's or chief engineer's unlimited endorsement, the applicant must have acquired military service in the capacity of commanding officer or engineer officer, respectively.</P>
              <P>(2) Applicants for management-level, operational-level or support-level STCW endorsements must demonstrate competence in accordance with part 11, subpart C; part 12, subpart F; and part 13, subpart F of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(3) Service in deck ratings on military vessels such as seaman apprentice, seaman, boatswain's mate, quartermaster, or Radarman/Operations Specialist are considered deck service for the purposes of this part. Service in other ratings may be considered if the applicant establishes that his or her duties required a watchstanding presence on or about the bridge of a vessel. Service in engineer ratings on military vessels such as fireman apprentice, fireman, engineman, machinists mate, machinery technician, or boiler tender are considered engineer service for the purposes of this part. There are also other ratings such as electrician, hull technician, or damage controlman, which may be credited when the applicant establishes that his or her duties required watchstanding duties in an operating engine room.</P>
              <P>(4) In addition to service on vessels that get underway regularly, members of the Armed Forces may obtain creditable service for assignment to vessels that get underway infrequently, such as tenders and repair vessels. Normally, a 25-percent factor is applied to these time periods. This experience can be equated with general shipboard familiarity, training, ship's business, and other related duties.</P>
              <P>(5) Sea service obtained on submarines is creditable, as if it were surface vessel service, for deck and engineer officer and qualified ratings endorsements under the provision of paragraph (a) of this section. For application for deck officer and qualified ratings endorsements, submarine service may be creditable if at least 25 percent of all service submitted for the endorsement was obtained on surface vessels (e.g. if 4 years' total service were submitted for an original officer endorsement, at least 1 year must have been obtained on surface craft in order for the submarine service to be eligible for evaluation).</P>
              <P>(6) Service gained in a civilian capacity as commanding officer, master, mate, engineer, or pilot, etc., of any vessel owned and operated by the United States, in any service in which a license or officer endorsement as master, mate, engineer, or pilot was not required at the time of such service, will be evaluated by the Coast Guard for a determination of equivalence.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Sea service on vessels that do not get underway.</E> This requirement applies to service obtained on vessels mandated by the Certificate of Inspection (COI) <PRTPAGE P="129"/>which are in operation but do not get underway or occasionally get underway for short voyages. Service while the vessel is not underway must be credited as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Engineering department. Service may be credited day-for-day for up to 50 percent of the service credit for renewal, raise of grade, and original issue for each day the engineering plant is operational.</P>
              <P>(2) Deck department. Service may be credited as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Original issue and raise of grade. Service is creditable on a 3-for-1 basis (12 months of experience equals 4 months of creditable service) for up to 6 months of service credit.</P>
              <P>(ii) Renewal. Service in any capacity in the deck department is creditable as closely related service under § 10.227(e)(1)(iv). When submitted in combination with underway service, service is creditable on a 3-for-1 basis (12 months of experience equals 4 months of creditable service) for up to 6 months of service credit.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Foreign sea service.</E> (1) Experience and service acquired on foreign vessels is creditable for establishing eligibility for an original or renewal of an officer, rating, or STCW endorsement, subject to evaluation by the Coast Guard to determine that it is a fair and reasonable equivalent to service acquired on merchant vessels of the United States with respect to grade, tonnage, horsepower, waters, and operating conditions. This experience and service is also creditable to meet recency requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) Experience and service acquired on foreign vessels while holding a valid U.S. endorsement is creditable for establishing eligibility for a raise of grade of an officer, rating, or STCW endorsement, subject to evaluation as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. This experience and service is also creditable to meet recency requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) An applicant who has obtained qualifying experience on foreign vessels must submit satisfactory documentary evidence of such service (including any necessary official translation to the English language) in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Closely related service.</E> The Coast Guard may accept evidence of employment in a position closely related to the operation, construction, or repair of vessels (either deck or engineer as appropriate) as meeting the sea service requirements for renewal under § 10.227(e)(1)(iv). Service as port engineer, port captain, shipyard superintendent, qualified instructor, or similar related service may be creditable for service for raise of grade of an engineer or deck officer endorsement; however, it may not be used for obtaining an original management-level endorsement. The service is creditable as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Port engineer, port captain or shipyard superintendent experience is creditable on a 3-for-1 basis for a raise of grade (e.g., 12 months of experience equals 4 months of creditable service). For a raise-of-grade, this credit is limited to 6 months of service.</P>
              <P>(2) Service as a qualified instructor in a Coast Guard approved course or a training program is creditable on a 2-for-1 basis for a raise of grade (e.g., 12 months of experience equals 6 months of creditable service). For a raise-of-grade, this credit is limited to 6 months of service.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Day.</E> (1) Except as noted otherwise, for the purpose of calculating service in this subchapter, a day is equal to 8 hours of watchstanding or day-working not to include overtime.</P>
              <P>(2) On vessels authorized by 46 U.S.C. 8104 and 46 CFR 15.705, to operate a two-watch system, a 12-hour working day may be creditable as 1<FR>1/2</FR> days of service.</P>
              <P>(3) On vessels of less than 100 GRT, a day is considered as 8 hours unless the Coast Guard determines that the vessel's operating schedule makes this criterion inappropriate; in no case will this period be less than 4 hours.</P>
              <P>(4) When computing service on MODUs for any endorsement, a day of MODU service must be a minimum of 4 hours, and no additional credit is received for periods served over 8 hours.</P>
              <P>(5) For cadet service on a training ship furnished by the Maritime Administration under 46 CFR 310.4, a day may be creditable as 1<FR>1/2</FR> days of service.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Tonnage equivalency.</E> For the purpose of parts 10, 11 and 12, 200 GRT will <PRTPAGE P="130"/>be considered equivalent to 500 GT, and 1,600 GRT will be considered equivalent to 3,000 GT.</P>

              <P>(a) Any MMC or endorsement is subject to suspension or revocation on the same grounds, in the same manner, and with like procedure as provided in 46 U.S.C. chapter 77.</P>
              <P>(b) When any individual's credential is revoked, it is no longer valid for any purpose, and any MMC subsequently requested must be applied for as an original following the procedures of §§ 5.901-5.905 of this subchapter. When an endorsement on an individual's MMC is revoked, it is no longer valid, and any endorsement of the same type subsequently requested must be applied for as an original following the procedures of §§ 5.901-5.905 of this subchapter. When an officer's endorsement is revoked, the Coast Guard will issue an MMC containing any rating endorsement for which the holder is qualified.</P>
              <P>(c) An applicant who has had a TWIC, credential, or endorsement revoked, and who is applying for a subsequent MMC or endorsement, must state in his or her application the date of revocation, the serial number of the document revoked, and the type of document or endorsement revoked.</P>
              <P>(d) A person whose credential or endorsement has been revoked or suspended without probation may not be issued a replacement credential or endorsement without approval of the Commandant. If a mariner has multiple endorsements and one or more, but not all, of those endorsements are suspended or revoked, he or she will be issued, without payment of a fee, a replacement MMC reflecting those endorsements for which the mariner remains qualified.</P>
              <P>(e) When a credential or endorsement that is about to expire has been suspended, without probation, the renewal of the credential or endorsement will be withheld until expiration of the suspension period.</P>
              <P>(f) When applying for an original endorsement on an MMC, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, an individual's existing service and training may be considered by the Coast Guard when determining the grade of the endorsement to be issued.</P>
              <P>(g) An applicant for renewal or return of a credential with endorsement as master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels whose most recent credential has been suspended or revoked by an administrative law judge for incompetence must complete the practical demonstration required under § 10.227(e)(6)(i) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(h) If the Coast Guard is advised by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) that a mariner has either been denied a TWIC or their TWIC has been revoked, the Coast Guard may initiate suspension and revocation action against the mariner's MMC, license, MMD, and COR under 46 U.S.C. 7702 and 7703. During the subsequent suspension and revocation proceeding, the TSA decision to deny issuance of, or to revoke, a mariner's TWIC will not be subject to review, and the mariner's failure to hold a TWIC will be treated by the Coast Guard as proof that the mariner is not eligible for an MMC, license, MMD or COR.</P>

              <P>(i) A mariner that has either been denied issuance of a TWIC or whose TWIC has been revoked for a reason, other <PRTPAGE P="131"/>than administrative reasons (e.g., being lost or stolen, not functioning, or having a misspelling) will be deemed ineligible for an MMC, license, MMD or COR.</P>

              <P>(a) To qualify for a medical certificate, a mariner must provide evidence of meeting the medical and physical standards in this section on a CG-719-K or CG-719-K/E, as appropriate. The Coast Guard retains final authority for determining whether a mariner is medically and physically qualified.

Further clarifications of the requirements contained in the table are found throughout this subpart.</P>

              <P>(b) Any required test, exam, or demonstration must have been performed, witnessed, or reviewed by a licensed medical doctor, licensed physician assistant, licensed nurse practitioner, or a designated medical examiner. All licensed medical practitioners must hold a valid license issued in the United States. Medical examinations for Great Lakes Pilots must be conducted by a licensed medical doctor in accordance with the physical exam requirements in 46 CFR 402.210.<PRTPAGE P="138"/>

              <P>(a) The Coast Guard may grant a waiver if, after review of all relevant supporting medical documents and consultation with the examining physician, as needed, an applicant does not possess the vision, hearing, or general physical condition necessary; and extenuating circumstances warrant special consideration. An applicant may submit to the Coast Guard additional correspondence, records, and reports in support of a waiver. In this regard, recommendations from agencies of the Federal Government operating government vessels, as well as owners and operators of private vessels, made on behalf of their employees, will be given full consideration.</P>
              <P>(b) In general, medical waivers are approved when an applicant does not meet the applicable medical standards, but objective medical evidence indicates that the condition is sufficiently controlled and the effects of medication pose no significant risk to maritime and public safety. The Coast Guard retains final authority for the issuance of medical waivers.</P>
              <P>(c) Medical waivers may be granted with specific conditions to which the applicant must adhere, such as more frequent monitoring of the medical conditions, submission of medical exams and/or tests at varying intervals to track the ongoing status of the medical condition, or operational limitations in the manner the mariner may serve under the MMC.</P>
              <P>(d) The Coast Guard may place an operational limitation on medical and physical conditions. Any operational limitations will be reflected in the medical certificate.</P>
              <P>(e) The Coast Guard may place a restriction on a medical certificate based upon medical and physical conditions of an applicant. Any restriction will be reflected on the medical certificate and may include restriction of route or trade.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General medical exam.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The general medical exam must be documented and of such scope to ensure that there are no conditions that pose significant risk of sudden incapacitation or debilitating complication. This exam must also document any condition requiring medication <PRTPAGE P="139"/>that impairs cognitive ability, judgment, or reaction time. The Coast Guard will provide guidance on the conduct of general medical exams. Examiners should be familiar with the content and recommended medical evaluation data compiled in the medical guidelines.</P>
              <P>(b) Food handlers are not required to submit to a general medical exam, but must obtain a statement from a licensed physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner attesting that they are free of communicable diseases that pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Demonstration of physical ability.</E> (1) A demonstration of physical ability is required only if—</P>
              <P>(i) The medical practitioner conducting the general medical exam is concerned that an applicant's physical ability may impact maritime safety; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Table 1 to § 10.302(a) of this subpart shows that the mariner must pass a demonstration of physical ability.</P>
              <P>(2) For an applicant to satisfactorily pass a demonstration of physical ability, the examiner must be satisfied that the applicant—</P>
              <P>(i) Has no disturbance in the sense of balance;</P>
              <P>(ii) Is able, without assistance, to climb up and down vertical ladders and inclined stairs;</P>
              <P>(iii) Is able, without assistance, to step over a door sill or coaming;</P>
              <P>(iv) Is able to move through a restricted opening of 24-by-24 inches (61-by-61 centimeters);</P>
              <P>(v) Is able to grasp, lift, and manipulate various common shipboard tools, move hands and arms to open and close valve wheels in vertical and horizontal directions, and rotate wrists to turn handles;</P>
              <P>(vi) Does not have any impairment or disease that could prevent normal movement and physical activities;</P>
              <P>(vii) Is able to stand and walk for extended periods of time;</P>
              <P>(viii) Does not have any impairment or disease that could prevent response to a visual or audible alarm; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Is capable of normal conversation.</P>
              <P>(3) Guidance on demonstration of physical ability is contained in the relevant Coast Guard guidance for the conduct of general medical exams.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reports of medical and physical exams, demonstrations, and tests.</E> These reports must be submitted within 12 months from the date signed by the licensed medical professional. When submitted with a complete application package, these reports remain valid for 12 months from the date the Coast Guard accepts a complete application.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Vision requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Deck standard.</E> (1) A mariner must have correctable vision to at least 20/40 in one eye and uncorrected vision of at least 20/200 in the same eye. The color sense must be determined to be satisfactory when tested by any of the following methods or an alternative test acceptable to the Coast Guard, without the use of color-sensing lenses:</P>
              <P>(i) Pseudoisochromatic Plates (Dvorine, 2nd Edition; AOC; revised edition or AOC-HRR; Ishihara 14-, 24- , or 38-;plate editions).</P>

              <P>(iv) Optec 900.</P>
              <P>(v) Richmond Test, 2nd and 4th edition.</P>
              <P>(2) Applicants for an STCW endorsement must have correctable vision to at least 20/40 in both eyes and uncorrected vision of at least 20/200 in both eyes. A mariner who previously met these requirements and who suffers loss of vision in one eye after being issued an MMC is subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, as applicable. A mariner holding an MMC prior to January 1, 2017, must continue to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Engineering, radio officer, tankerman, and MODU standard.</E> A mariner must have correctable vision to at least 20/50 in one eye and uncorrected vision of at least 20/200 in the same eye and need only the ability to distinguish the colors red, green, blue, and yellow. The color sense must be determined to be satisfactory when tested by any color-vision test listed in paragraph (a) of this section, or an alternative test acceptable to the Coast Guard, without the use of color-sensing lenses. The <PRTPAGE P="140"/>Coast Guard will accept Farnsworth D-15 Hue Test as a color vision test to meet the requirements of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Vision waiver.</E> Any applicant whose uncorrected vision does not meet the 20/200 standard and is correctable to listed standards above may be granted a medical waiver in accordance with § 10.303 of this subpart. If a vision waiver is granted, a limitation will be placed on his or her a medical certificate indicating the mariner may not serve under the authority of the endorsement unless corrective lenses are worn and spare lenses are carried onboard a vessel. Waivers are not normally granted to an applicant whose corrected vision in the better eye is not at least 20/40 for deck officers or 20/50 for engineer officers.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Vision operational limitation.</E> If corrective lenses are required in order to meet the vision standards above, a mariner may not serve under the authority of the endorsement unless corrective lenses are worn and spare lenses are carried onboard a vessel. This operational limitation will be placed on his or her medical certificate.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Loss of vision.</E> A mariner having lost vision in one eye must wait 6 months from the date of the vision loss before submitting any application, and must provide a statement of demonstrated ability on his or her medical examination.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Hearing requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the medical practitioner conducting the general medical exam has concerns that an applicant's ability to hear may impact maritime safety, the examining medical practitioner must refer the applicant to an audiologist or other hearing specialist to conduct an audiometer test and a speech discrimination test, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) The audiometer test must include testing at the following thresholds: 500 Hz; 1,000 Hz; 2,000 Hz; and 3,000 Hz. The frequency responses for each ear must be averaged to determine the measure of an applicant's hearing ability. Applicants must demonstrate an unaided threshold of 30 decibels or less in at least one ear.</P>
              <P>(c) The functional speech discrimination test must be carried out at a level of 65 decibels. For issuance of an original MMC or endorsement the applicant must demonstrate functional speech discrimination of at least 90 percent. For renewal or raise of grade, the applicant must demonstrate functional speech discrimination of at least 80 percent.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Hearing waivers.</E> An applicant who is unable to meet the hearing standards of the audiometer test, but who can pass the functional speech discrimination test; or who requires hearing aids to meet the hearing standards, may be eligible for a medical waiver in accordance with § 10.303 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Hearing operational limitation.</E> If hearing aids are required in order to meet the hearing standards above, a mariner may not serve under the authority of the endorsement unless hearing aids are worn in the operational mode, and spare batteries are carried onboard a vessel. This operational limitation will be placed on his or her medical certificate.</P>

              <P>(a) When the training and assessment of competence required by this part are not subject to Coast Guard approval under §§ 10.402 and 10.407 of this subpart, but are used to qualify a mariner to hold an endorsement, the offeror of the course or program must ensure that such training and assessment meets the same standards as those found in §§ 10.402 and 10.403 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) The Coast Guard will accept courses approved and monitored by a Coast Guard-accepted Quality Standard System (QSS) organization. The Coast Guard maintains a list of training organizations conducting accepted training that are independently monitored by a Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization. The Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization must comply with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Submit a certificate of acceptance of training to the Coast Guard.</P>
              <P>(2) Submit an updated certificate of acceptance to the Coast Guard if the terms of acceptance have been changed.</P>

              <P>(c) The training must be audited periodically in accordance with the requirements of § 10.409(e)(7) of this subpart. If the Coast Guard determines, on the basis of its own observations or conclusions or those of the Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization, that the particular training does not satisfy one or more of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section—</P>
              <P>(1) The Coast Guard or Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization will so notify the offeror of the training by letter, enclosing a report of the observations and conclusions;</P>
              <P>(2) The offeror may, within a period of time specified in the notice, either appeal the observations or conclusions to the Commandant (CG-MMC) or bring the training into compliance; and</P>
              <P>(3) If the appeal is denied—or if the deficiency is not corrected in the allotted time, or within any additional time period judged by the Coast Guard to be appropriate, considering progress toward compliance—the Coast Guard will remove the training from the list maintained under paragraph (b) of this section until it can verify full compliance. The Coast Guard may deny applications for endorsements based, in whole or in part, on training not on the list, until additional training or assessment is documented.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 11.201</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>General requirements for national and STCW officer endorsements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In addition to the requirements of part 10 of this subchapter, the applicant for an officer endorsement, whether original, renewal, <PRTPAGE P="155"/>duplicate, or raise of grade, must establish to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard that he or she possesses all the qualifications necessary (including but not limited to age, experience, character, physical health, citizenship, approved training, professional competence, and a test for dangerous drugs) before the Coast Guard will issue to him or her a merchant mariner credential (MMC). An applicant for any STCW endorsement must hold the appropriate national endorsement unless otherwise specified.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">English language requirements.</E> Except as provided in § 11.467(h) of this part, an applicant for an officer endorsement must demonstrate an ability to speak and understand English as found in the navigation rules, aids to navigation publications, emergency equipment instructions, machinery instructions, and radiotelephone communications instructions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Experience and service.</E> (1) Applicants for officer endorsements should refer to § 10.232 of this subchapter for information regarding requirements for documentation and proof of sea service.</P>
              <P>(2) An applicant for a national officer endorsement must have at least 3 months of required service on vessels of appropriate tonnage or horsepower within the 3 years immediately preceding the date of application.</P>
              <P>(3) No original officer endorsement may be issued to any naturalized citizen based on less experience in any grade or capacity than would have been required of a citizen of the United States by birth.</P>
              <P>(4) Experience and service acquired on foreign vessels is creditable for establishing eligibility for an officer endorsement, subject to evaluation by the Coast Guard to determine that it is a fair and reasonable equivalent to service acquired on merchant vessels of the United States, with respect to grade, tonnage, horsepower, waters, and operating conditions. An applicant who has obtained qualifying experience on foreign vessels must submit satisfactory documentary evidence of such service (including any necessary translation into English) in accordance with § 10.232 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(5) No applicant for an original officer endorsement who is a naturalized citizen and who has obtained experience on foreign vessels will be given an original officer endorsement in a grade higher than that upon which he or she has actually served while acting under the authority of a foreign credential.</P>
              <P>(6) Experience acquired while the applicant was less than 16 years of age is generally not creditable. Compelling circumstances and unique experiences acquired before the applicant reaches 16 years of age will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Citizenship.</E> No officer endorsement may be issued to any person who is not a citizen of the United States with the exception of operators of uninspected passenger vessels that are not documented under the laws of the United States.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Age.</E> Except as specified in this paragraph, no officer endorsement may be issued to a person who has not attained the age of 21 years. The required evidence of age may be established using any of the items submitted to establish citizenship set out in 49 CFR 1572.17.</P>
              <P>(1) An endorsement may be granted to an applicant who has reached the age of 19 years as—</P>
              <P>(i) Master of near-coastal, Great Lakes and inland, or river vessels of 25-200 GRT;</P>
              <P>(ii) Third mate;</P>
              <P>(iii) Third assistant engineer;</P>
              <P>(iv) Mate of vessels of between 200 GRT and 1,600 GRT;</P>
              <P>(v) Ballast control operator (BCO);</P>

              <P>(x) Assistant engineer (limited); or</P>
              <P>(xi) Designated duty engineer of vessels of less than 4,000 HP/3,000 kW.</P>
              <P>(2) An endorsement may be granted to an applicant who has reached the age of 18 years as—</P>
              <P>(i) Limited master of near-coastal vessels of less than 100 GRT;</P>
              <P>(ii) Limited master of Great Lakes and inland vessels of less than 100 GRT;</P>

              <P>(iii) Mate of Great Lakes and inland vessels of 25-200 GRT;<PRTPAGE P="156"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) Mate of near-coastal vessels of 25-200 GRT;</P>
              <P>(v) Operator of uninspected passenger vessels (OUPV);</P>
              <P>(vi) Designated duty engineer of vessels of less than 1,000 HP/750 kW;</P>
              <P>(vii) Apprentice mate (steersman) of towing vessels;</P>
              <P>(viii) Officer in charge of a navigational watch (OICNW);</P>
              <P>(ix) Officer in charge of an engineering watch (OICEW); and</P>
              <P>(x) Electro-technical officer (ETO).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Physical examination.</E> (1) Persons serving or intending to serve in the merchant marine service are encouraged to take the earliest opportunity to ascertain, through examination, whether their visual acuity, color vision, hearing, and general physical condition, are such as to qualify them for service in that profession. Any physical impairment or medical condition that would render an applicant incompetent to perform the ordinary duties required of an officer is cause for denial of an officer endorsement.</P>
              <P>(2) Applications for an original officer endorsement, raises of grade, and extensions of route, must be current and up to date with respect to service and the physical examination, as appropriate. Physical examinations and applications are valid for 12 months from the date the application is approved.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Character check.</E> (1) An individual may apply for an original officer endorsement, or officer or STCW endorsement of a different type, while on probation as a result of administrative action under part 5 of this chapter. The offense for which the applicant was placed on probation will be considered in determining his or her fitness to hold the endorsement applied for. An officer or STCW endorsement issued to an applicant on probation will be subject to the same probationary conditions as were imposed against the applicant's other credential. An applicant may not take an examination for an officer or STCW endorsement during any period of time when a suspension without probation or a revocation is effective against the applicant's currently held license, merchant mariner document (MMD), or MMC, or while an appeal from these actions is pending.</P>
              <P>(2) If information about the applicant's habits of life and character is brought to the attention of the Coast Guard after an original license, certificate of registry, or officer endorsement has been issued, and if such information reasonably supports the conclusion that the applicant cannot be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of the license, certificate of registry, or officer endorsement issued, or indicates that the application for the license, certificate of registry, or officer endorsement was false or incomplete, the Coast Guard may notify the holder in writing that the license, certificate of registry, or officer endorsement is considered null and void, direct the holder to return the credential to the Coast Guard, and advise the holder that, upon return of the credential, the appeal procedures of § 10.237 of this subchapter apply.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Firefighting certificate.</E> (1) Applicants for an original officer endorsement in the following categories must present a certificate of completion from a firefighting course of instruction that has been approved by the Coast Guard. The firefighting course must have been completed within the past 5 years, or if it was completed more than 5 years before the date of application, the applicant must provide evidence of maintaining the standard of competence in accordance with the firefighting requirements for the credential sought.</P>
              <P>(2) The following categories must meet the requirements for basic and advanced firefighting in Regulations VI/1 and VI/3 of the STCW Convention and Tables A-VI/1-2 and A-VI/3 of the STCW Code (both incorporated by reference, see § 11.102 of this part):</P>
              <P>(i) National officer endorsements as master or mate on seagoing vessels of 200 GRT or more.</P>
              <P>(ii) All national officer endorsements for master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels, except apprentice mate (steersman) of the vessels, on oceans.</P>

              <P>(iv) All national officer endorsements for engineers.</P>
              <P>(v) All national officer endorsements for OSVs.<PRTPAGE P="157"/>
              </P>
              <P>(vi) All STCW officer endorsements except GMDSS radio operator.</P>
              <P>(3) The following categories must meet the requirements for basic firefighting in Regulation VI/1 of the STCW Convention and Table A-VI/1-2 of the STCW Code:</P>
              <P>(i) Officer endorsement as master on vessels of less than 500 GT in ocean service.</P>
              <P>(ii) All officer endorsements for master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels, except apprentice mate (steersman) of towing vessels, in all services except oceans.</P>
              <P>(4) Applicants for a raise of grade of an officer endorsement who have not previously met the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section must do so.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">First-aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) course certificates.</E> All applicants for an original officer endorsement, except as provided in §§ 11.429, 11.456, and 11.467 of this part, must present to the Coast Guard—</P>
              <P>(1) Evidence of continued competency in STCW basic training in accordance with § 11.302 of this part or a certificate indicating completion not more than 1 year from the date of application of —</P>
              <P>(i) The American National Red Cross Standard First Aid course or American National Red Cross Community First Aid &amp; Safety course; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A Coast Guard-approved first-aid course; and</P>
              <P>(2) A currently valid certificate of completion of a CPR course from either—</P>
              <P>(i) The American National Red Cross;</P>

              <P>(iii) A Coast Guard-approved CPR course.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Professional examination.</E> (1) When the Coast Guard finds the applicant's experience and training to be satisfactory, and the applicant is eligible in all other respects, the Coast Guard will authorize examination in accordance with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) Except for an endorsement required by the STCW Convention, any applicant for a deck or engineer officer endorsement limited to vessels less than 200 GRT, or an officer endorsement limited to uninspected fishing industry vessels, may request an orally assisted examination instead of any written or other textual examination. If there are textual questions that the applicant has difficulty reading and understanding, the Coast Guard will offer the orally assisted examination. Each officer endorsement based on an orally assisted examination is limited to the specific route and type of vessel upon which the applicant obtained the majority of service.</P>
              <P>(ii) The general instructions for administration of examinations and the lists of subjects for all officer endorsements appear in subpart I of this part. The Coast Guard will place in the applicant's file a record indicating the subjects covered.</P>
              <P>(iii) An applicant enrolled in an approved comprehensive program of training, service, and assessment will be authorized for an examination not more than 6 months prior to completion of the comprehensive program, provided all sea service and assessments of competency are completed prior to the examination.</P>
              <P>(iv) The examination, whether administered orally or by other means, must be conducted only in the English language.</P>
              <P>(2) When the application has been approved for examination, the approval is valid for 1 year.</P>

              <P>(a) Applicants for officer endorsements should refer to § 10.232 of this subchapter for information regarding requirements for documentation and proof of sea service.</P>
              <P>(b) Service toward an oceans, near-coastal, or STCW endorsement will be credited as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Service on the Great Lakes will be credited on a day-for-day basis up to 100 percent of the total required service.</P>
              <P>(2) Service on inland waters, other than Great Lakes, that are navigable waters of the United States, will be credited on a day-for-day basis for up to 50 percent of the total required service.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Service on mobile offshore drilling units.</E> (1) MODU service is creditable for raise of grade of an officer endorsement. Evidence of 1 year of service on MODUs as mate or equivalent while holding an officer endorsement or license as third mate, or as engineering officer of the watch or equivalent while holding an officer endorsement or license as third assistant engineer, is acceptable for a raise of grade to second mate or second assistant engineer, respectively. However, any subsequent raises of grade of unlimited, non-restricted officer licenses or endorsements must include a minimum of 6 months of service on conventional vessels.</P>
              <P>(2) Service on MODUs maintaining station by means of dynamic positioning, may be credited as service on conventional vessels for any raise of grade; however, time more than 8 hours each day will not be credited.</P>
              <P>(3) A day of creditable MODU service must be a minimum of 4 hours, and no additional credit will be granted for periods of more than 8 hours.</P>
              <P>(4) Creditable MODU service excludes time spent ashore due to crew rotation.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Service on Articulated Tug Barges (ATBs) and Integrated Tug Barges (ITBs).</E> Service on ATB or Dual Mode ITB units is creditable for an original deck officer endorsement or raise of grade of any deck officer endorsement. Service on an ATB or Dual Mode ITB with an aggregate tonnage of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more is creditable on a two-for-one basis (2 days experience equals 1 day of creditable service) for up to 50 percent of the total service on vessels of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more required for an unlimited officer endorsement. The remaining required service on vessels of more than 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT must be obtained on conventional vessels or Push Mode ITBs.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Service on towing vessels.</E> Service as master or mate (pilot) on towing vessels, when the aggregate tonnage of the tug and barges is 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more, is creditable, using the aggregate tonnage, on a two-for-one basis (2 days experience equals 1 day of creditable service) for up to 50 percent of the total service on vessels of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more required for an unlimited officer endorsement. The remaining required service on vessels of more than 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT must be obtained on conventional vessels. This service must be documented as specified in § 10.232(a) of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(f) Individuals obtaining sea service as part of an approved training curriculum pursuant to either § 11.407(a)(2) or § 11.516(a)(3) of this part must do so in the capacity of cadet (deck) or cadet (engine), as appropriate, notwithstanding any other rating endorsements the individual may hold or any other capacity in which the individual may have served.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Other experience.</E> Other experience in a marine-related area, other than at sea, or sea service performed on unique vessels, will be evaluated by the Coast Guard for a determination of equivalence to traditional service.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Tonnage.</E> When determining sea service credit for officer endorsement applicants under subpart D of this part, the tonnage of a vessel solely admeasured using the Convention measurement scheme under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 143 will be credited as Gross Register Tonnage. This paragraph does not apply to those vessels measured under the optional regulatory measurement provisions of 46 U.S.C. 14305.</P>

              <P>(a) Subject to the provisions of §§ 11.464(e) and 11.465(b) of this subpart, any license or MMC endorsement for service as master or mate on ocean waters qualifies the mariner to serve in the same grade on any waters, except towing vessels upon western rivers subject to the limitations of the endorsement.</P>
              <P>(b) Subject to the provisions of §§ 11.464(e) and 11.465(b) of this subpart, any license or MMC endorsement issued for service as master or mate on near-coastal waters qualifies the mariner to serve in the same grade on Great Lakes and inland waters, except towing vessels upon western rivers subject to the limitations of the endorsement.</P>
              <P>(c) Near-coastal endorsements for unlimited tonnage require the same number of years of service as the ocean-unlimited endorsements. The primary differences in these endorsements are the nature of the service and the scope of the required training, examination, and assessment.</P>
              <P>(d) A master or mate on vessels of 200 GRT or more, and a master or mate on vessels under 200 GRT, may be endorsed for sail or auxiliary sail as appropriate. The applicant must present the equivalent total service required for conventional officer endorsements, including at least 1 year of deck experience on that specific type of vessel. For example, for an officer endorsement as master of vessels of less than 1,600 GRT endorsed for auxiliary sail, the applicant must meet the total experience requirements for the conventional officer endorsement, including time as mate, and the proper tonnage experience, including at least 1 year of deck service, on appropriately sized auxiliary sail vessels. For an endorsement to serve on vessels of less than 200 GRT, see the individual endorsement requirements.</P>
              <P>(e) Service toward an oceans, near-coastal or STCW endorsement will be credited as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Service on the Great Lakes will be credited on a day-for-day basis.</P>
              <P>(2) Service on inland waters, other than Great Lakes, that are navigable waters of the United States, may be substituted for up to 50 percent of the total required service.</P>
              <P>(3) Service on vessels to which STCW applies, whether inland or coastwise, will be credited on a day-for-day basis.</P>

              <P>(a) To qualify for a national ocean or near-coastal endorsement for service on vessels of unlimited tonnage—</P>
              <P>(1) All the required experience must be obtained on vessels of 100 GRT or more; and</P>
              <P>(2) At least one-half of the required experience must be obtained on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more.</P>
              <P>(b) If an applicant for a national endorsement as master or mate of unlimited tonnage does not have the service on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a tonnage limitation will be placed on the MMC based on the applicant's qualifying experience. The endorsement will be limited to the maximum tonnage on which at least 25 percent of the required experience was obtained, or 150 percent of the maximum tonnage on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained, whichever is higher. However, the minimum tonnage limitation calculated according to this paragraph will be 2,000 GRT. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 GRT using the next higher figure when an intermediate tonnage is calculated. When the calculated limitation equals or exceeds 10,000 GRT, the applicant is issued an unlimited tonnage endorsement.</P>
              <P>(c) Tonnage limitations imposed under paragraph (b) of this section may be raised or removed in one of the following manners:</P>
              <P>(1) When the applicant provides evidence of 6 months of service on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more in the highest grade endorsed, all tonnage limitations will be removed.</P>
              <P>(2) When the applicant provides evidence of 6 months of service on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more in any capacity as an officer other than the highest grade for which he or she is endorsed, all tonnage limitations for the grade in which the service is performed will be removed and the next higher grade endorsement will be raised to the tonnage of the vessel on which the majority of the service was performed. The total cumulative service before and after issuance of the limited license or MMC officer endorsement may be considered in removing all tonnage limitations.</P>
              <P>(3) When the applicant has 12 months of service as able seaman on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more while holding a license or endorsement as third mate, all tonnage limitations on the third mate's license or MMC officer endorsement will be removed.</P>
              <P>(d) No applicant holding any national endorsement as master or mate of vessels of less than 1,600 GRT, less than 500 GRT, or less than 25-200 GRT may use the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section to increase the tonnages of his or her license or endorsement.</P>

              <P>(a) Each national endorsement as master or mate of vessels of less than 200 GRT is issued with a tonnage limitation based on the applicant's qualifying experience. The tonnage limitation will be issued at the 25, 50, 100, or 200 GRT level. The endorsement will be limited to the maximum GRT on which at least 25 percent of the required experience was obtained, or 150 percent of the maximum GRT on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained, whichever is higher. Limitations are as stated above, using the next higher figure when an intermediate tonnage is calculated. If more than 75 percent of the qualifying experience is obtained on vessels of 5 GRT or less, the MMC will automatically be limited to vessels of less than 25 GRT.</P>
              <P>(b) The tonnage limitation may be raised as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For an endorsement as mate, with at least 45 days of additional service on deck of a vessel in the highest tonnage increment authorized by the officer endorsement.</P>
              <P>(2) For an endorsement as master, with at least 90 days of additional service on deck of a vessel in the highest tonnage increment authorized by the master endorsement.</P>
              <P>(3) With additional service, which, when combined with all previously accumulated service, will qualify the applicant for a higher tonnage officer endorsement under the basic formula specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(4) With 6 months additional service in the deck department on vessels within the highest tonnage increment on the officer's license or MMC endorsement. In this case, the tonnage <PRTPAGE P="185"/>limitation may be raised one increment.</P>
              <P>(c) When the service is obtained on vessels upon which no personnel need an officer endorsement or license, the Coast Guard must be satisfied that the nature of this required service (i.e., size of vessel, route, equipment, etc.) is a reasonable equivalent to the duties performed on vessels which are required to engage individuals with officer endorsements.</P>
              <P>(d) Service gained in the engine room on vessels of 200 GRT or less may be creditable for up to 90 days of the deck service requirements for mate.</P>

              <P>(a) Engineer endorsements of all grades and types may be subject to propulsion power limitations. Other than as provided in § 11.524 of this subpart for the designated duty engineer (DDE), the propulsion power limitation placed on a license or MMC endorsement is based on the applicant's qualifying experience considering the total shaft propulsion power of each vessel on which the applicant has served.</P>
              <P>(b) When an applicant for an original or raise of grade of an engineer endorsement, other than a DDE, has not obtained at least 50 percent of the required experience on vessels of 4,000 HP/3,000 kW or more, a propulsion power limitation is placed on the MMC based on the applicant's qualifying experience. The endorsement is limited to the maximum propulsion power on which at least 25 percent of the required experience was obtained, or 150 percent of the maximum propulsion power on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained, whichever is higher. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 HP/750 kW, using the next higher figure when an intermediate horsepower is calculated. When the limitation as calculated equals or exceeds 10,000 HP/7,500 kW, an unlimited propulsion power endorsement is issued.</P>
              <P>(c) The following service on vessels of 4,000 HP/3,000 kW or more will be considered qualifying for raising or removing the propulsion power limitations placed on an engineer endorsement:</P>
              <P>(1) Six months of service in the highest-grade endorsed: Removal of all propulsion power limitations.</P>
              <P>(2) Six months of service as an engineer officer in any capacity other than the highest grade for which the applicant is licensed or endorsed: Removal of all propulsion power limitations for the grade in which service is performed and raised to the next higher grade endorsement to the propulsion power of the vessel on which service was performed. The total cumulative service before and after issuance of the limited engineer endorsement may be considered in removing all propulsion power limitations.</P>
              <P>(3) Twelve months of service as oiler or junior engineer while holding a license or MMC endorsement as third assistant engineer or assistant engineer (limited): Removal of all propulsion power limitations on third assistant engineer or assistant engineer's (limited) endorsement.</P>
              <P>(4) Six months of service as oiler or junior engineer while holding a license or MMC endorsement as second assistant engineer: removal of all propulsion power limitations on third assistant engineer's endorsement.</P>
              <P>(d) Raising or removing propulsion power limitations based on service required by paragraph (c) of this section may be granted without further written examination, if the Coast Guard considers further examination unnecessary.</P>

              <P>(2) The type and size of vessels using the waterway.</P>
              <P>(3) The abundance or absence of aids to navigation.</P>
              <P>(4) The background lighting effects.</P>
              <P>(5) The known hazards involved, including waterway obstructions or constrictions such as bridges, narrow channels, or sharp turns.</P>
              <P>(6) Any other factors unique to the route that the OCMI deems appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) An applicant holding no other deck officer endorsement seeking an endorsement as first-class pilot must furnish evidence of having completed a minimum number of roundtrips, while serving as quartermaster, wheelsman, able seaman, apprentice pilot, or in an equivalent capacity, standing regular watches at the wheel or in the pilot house as part of routine duties, over the route sought. Evidence of having completed a minimum number of roundtrips while serving as an observer, properly certified by the master and/or pilot of the vessel, is also acceptable. The range of roundtrips for an endorsement is a minimum of 12 roundtrips and a maximum of 20 roundtrips. An applicant may have additional routes added to the first-class pilot endorsement by meeting the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) An applicant who currently holds a deck officer license or MMC endorsement seeking an endorsement as first-class pilot for a particular route must furnish evidence of having completed the number of roundtrips over the route, specified by the OCMI, within the range limitations of this paragraph, for the particular grade of existing license or MMC endorsement held. The range of roundtrips for an endorsement is a minimum of eight roundtrips and a maximum of 15 roundtrips.</P>
              <P>(d) Unless determined impracticable by the OCMI, 25 percent of the roundtrips required by the OCMI under this section must be made during the hours of darkness.</P>
              <P>(e) One of the roundtrips required by the OCMI under this section must be made over the route within the 6 months immediately preceding the date of application.</P>

              <P>(a) In order to obtain a first-class pilot endorsement authorizing service on vessels of unlimited tonnage over a particular route, the applicant must have sufficient experience on vessels of more than 1,600 GRT.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of this section, an applicant is considered to have sufficient experience if the applicant has 18 months of experience as master, mate, quartermaster, wheelsman, able seaman, apprentice pilot, or in an equivalent capacity, standing regular watches at the wheel or in the pilothouse as part of routine duties, on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more, and two-thirds of the minimum number of roundtrips required for the route have been on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more.</P>
              <P>(c) If an applicant does not have sufficient experience on vessels of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more, the endorsement will be for a limited tonnage until the applicant completes a number of additional roundtrips, as determined by the OCMI, within the range contained in § 11.705(b) or (c) of this subpart, as appropriate on vessels of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more.</P>
              <P>(d) For purposes of this section, for experience with respect to tonnage on towing vessels, the combined gross tonnage of the towing vessels and the vessels towed will be considered. However, the Coast Guard may require that all or a portion of the required number of roundtrips be obtained on self-propelled vessels of 1,600 GRT or more, when the Coast Guard determines that due to the nature of the waters and the overall experience of the applicant, self-propelled vessel experience is necessary to obtain a first-class pilot endorsement that is not restricted to tug and barge combinations.</P>

              <P>(b) For certain long or extended routes, the OCMI may, at his or her discretion, allow the re-familiarization requirement to be satisfied by reviewing appropriate navigation charts, coast pilots tide and current tables, local Notice to Mariners, and any other materials that would provide the pilot with current knowledge of the route. Persons using this method of re-familiarization must certify, when applying for renewal of their license or MMC endorsement, the material they have reviewed and the dates on which this was accomplished.

              <P>(2) The Coast Guard will no longer issue original endorsements for deck engineer, deck/engine mechanic, or engineman, or individual endorsements for refrigerating engineer, machinist, electrician, and pumpman. However, a mariner who holds any of these endorsements may continue to renew them as long as he or she is otherwise qualified.</P>
              <P>(3) If the holder of an endorsement as pumpman only or machinist only seeks the combined endorsement of pumpman/machinist, the mariner must pass the examination described in Table 1 to § 12.505(c) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) If the holder of an endorsement as electrician only or refrigerating engineer only seeks the combined endorsement of electrician/refrigerating engineer, the mariner must pass the examination described in Table 1 to § 12.505(c) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for certification.</E> To qualify for any endorsement as QMED, an applicant must—</P>

              <P>(a) An applicant for an endorsement as QMED must provide the Coast Guard with proof of qualification based on 6 months of service in a rating at least equal to that of wiper or coal passer.</P>
              <P>(b) Approved training programs may be substituted for the required periods of service as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) A graduate of a school ship may qualify for a rating endorsement as QMED, without further service, upon satisfactory completion of the program of instruction. For this purpose, school ship is interpreted to mean an institution that offers a complete approved program of instruction, including a period of at-sea training, in the skills appropriate to the rating of QMED.</P>
              <P>(2) Training programs, other than those classified as a school ship, may be substituted for up to one-half of the required service. The service/training ratio for each program is determined by the Coast Guard.</P>

              <P>(i) A statement that the applicant has successfully undergone an employer-conducted background check;</P>
              <P>(ii) A description of the employer-conducted background check, including all databases and records searched. The background check must, at a minimum, show that the employer has reviewed all information reasonably and legally available to the owner or managing operator, including the review of available court and police records in the applicant's country of citizenship, and any other country in which the applicant has received employment referrals, or resided, for the past 20 years prior to the date of application; and</P>

The employer must maintain a detailed record of the seaman's total service on all authorized U.S. flag large passenger vessels, and must make that information available to the Coast Guard upon request, to demonstrate that the limitations of § 12.811(c) of this subpart have not been exceeded.</P>
              <P>(d) In the event that the seaman's MMC and/or TWIC expires, the seaman's visa status terminates, the seaman serves onboard the U.S. flag large passenger vessel(s) for 36 months in the aggregate as a nonimmigrant crewman, the employer terminates employment of the seaman, or, if the seaman otherwise ceases working with the employer, the employer must return the MMC to the Coast Guard and/or the TWIC to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within 10 days of the event.</P>

              <P>(2) Conduct a background check each year that the MMC is valid to search for any changes that might have occurred since the last employer-conducted background check was performed. The annual background check must—</P>
              <P>(i) Be conducted to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard in accordance with the same criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except that the period of time examined during the annual background check need only extend back to the date of the last background check; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Be submitted to the Coast Guard on or before the anniversary of the issuance date of the MMC.</P>

              <P>(b) To meet the citizenship and identity requirements of this subpart, an applicant must present an unexpired passport issued by the government of the country of which the applicant is a citizen or subject, and either a valid U.S. C-1/D Crewman Visa or another valid U.S. visa or authority deemed acceptable by the Coast Guard.</P>
              <P>(c) Any non-resident alien applying for an MMC under this subpart may not be a citizen of, or a temporary or permanent resident of, a country designated by the Department of State as a “State Sponsor of Terrorism” pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)) or section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2371).</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 12.811</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Restrictions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An MMC issued to a non-resident alien under this subpart authorizes service only in the steward's department of the U.S. flag large passenger vessel(s), that is/are under the same common ownership and control as the foreign flag passenger vessel(s) on which the non-resident alien served to meet the requirements of § 12.807(a) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) The MMC will be endorsed for service in the steward's department, in accordance with § 12.703 of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) The MMC may also be endorsed for service as a food handler if the applicant meets the requirements of § 12.703 of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) No other rating or endorsement is authorized, except lifeboatman or lifeboatman-limited, in which case all applicable requirements of this subchapter and the STCW Convention and STCW Code (incorporated by reference, see § 12.103 of this part) must be met.</P>
              <P>(b) The following restrictions must be printed on the MMC, or be listed in an accompanying Coast Guard letter, or both:</P>
              <P>(1) The name and official number of all U.S. flag vessels on which the non-resident alien may serve. Service is not authorized on any other U.S. flag vessel.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon issuance, the MMC must remain in the custody of the employer at all times.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon termination of employment, the MMC must be returned to the Coast Guard within 10 days, in accordance with § 12.805 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) A non-resident alien issued an MMC under this subpart may not perform watchstanding, engine room duty watch, or vessel navigation functions.</P>
              <P>(5) A non-resident alien issued an MMC under this subpart may perform emergency-related duties, provided that—</P>
              <P>(i) The emergency-related duties do not require any other rating or endorsement, except lifeboatman or lifeboatman-limited as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) The non-resident alien has completed familiarization and basic training (BT), as required in § 15.1105 of this subchapter;</P>
              <P>(iii) If the non-resident alien serves as a lifeboatman or lifeboatman-limited, he or she has the necessary lifeboatman or lifeboatman-limited endorsement; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The non-resident alien has completed the training for crewmembers on passenger ships performing duties involving safety or care for passengers, as required in § 15.1103 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(c) A non-resident alien may only serve for an aggregate period of 36 months of actual service on all authorized U.S. flag large passenger vessels combined under the provisions of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(d) Once this 36-month limitation is reached, the MMC becomes invalid and must be returned to the Coast Guard under § 12.805(d) of this subpart, and the non-resident alien is no longer authorized to serve in a position requiring an MMC on any U.S. flag large passenger vessel.<PRTPAGE P="264"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) An individual who successfully adjusts his or her immigration status to become either an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence to the United States, or a citizen of the United States, may apply for an MMC, subject to the requirements of § 10.221 of this subchapter, without any restrictions or limitations imposed by this subpart.</P>

              <P>(a) The owner or managing operator of a U.S. flag large passenger vessel seeking to employ non-resident aliens issued MMCs under this subpart may submit a plan to the Coast Guard, which, if approved, will serve as an alternative means of complying with the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) The plan must address all the elements contained in this subpart, as well as the related elements contained in § 15.530 of this subchapter, to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard.</P>

              <P>(a) If an applicant meets the requirements of subpart B of this part, the Coast Guard may endorse his or her MMC as tankerman-PIC with the appropriate cargo classification or classifications. A person holding this endorsement and meeting the other requirements of 33 CFR 155.710(a) may act as a PIC of a transfer of fuel oil, of a transfer of liquid cargo in bulk, or of cargo-tank cleaning on any tank vessel. That person may also act as a tankerman-engineer, provided that he or she also holds an engineer license or engineer endorsement.</P>
              <P>(b) If an applicant meets the requirements of subpart C of this part, the Coast Guard may endorse his or her MMC as tankerman-PIC (barge) with the appropriate cargo classification or classifications. A person holding this endorsement and meeting the other requirements of 33 CFR 155.710(b) may act as a PIC of a transfer of liquid cargo in bulk only on a tank barge.</P>
              <P>(c) If an applicant meets the requirements of subpart D of this part, the Coast Guard may endorse his or her MMC as tankerman-assistant with the appropriate cargo classification or classifications. No person holding this endorsement may act as a PIC of any transfer of fuel oil, of any transfer of liquid cargo in bulk, or of cargo-tank cleaning unless he or she also holds an endorsement authorizing service as PIC. He or she may, however, without being directly supervised by the PIC, perform duties relative to cargo and cargo-handling equipment assigned by the PIC of transfers of fuel oil, of transfers of liquid cargo in bulk, or of cargo-tank cleaning. When performing these duties, he or she shall maintain continuous two-way voice communications with the PIC.</P>
              <P>(d) If an applicant meets the requirements of subpart E of this part, the Coast Guard may endorse his or her MMC as tankerman-engineer. No person holding this endorsement may act as a PIC or tankerman-assistant of any transfer of liquid cargo in bulk, or of cargo-tank cleaning unless he or she also holds an endorsement authorizing such service. A person holding this endorsement and acting in this capacity has the primary responsibility, on his or her self-propelled tank vessel carrying dangerous liquid (DL) or liquefied gas (LG), for maintaining both the cargo systems and equipment for transfer of liquid cargo in bulk. No person licensed or credentialed under part 11 of this chapter may serve as a chief engineer, first assistant engineer, or cargo engineer aboard an inspected self-propelled tank vessel when liquid cargo in bulk or cargo residue is carried unless he or she holds an endorsement as tankerman-engineer or equivalent.</P>
              <P>(e) If an applicant meets the requirements of § 13.111 of this subpart, the Coast Guard may place on his or her MMC an endorsement as a tankerman-PIC restricted according to the definitions of “restricted tankerman endorsement” in § 10.107 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(f) This section does not apply to any person solely by reason of his or her involvement in bunkering or fueling.</P>

              <P>(1) A transfer must involve the loading or discharge from at least one of the vessel's cargo tanks to or from a shore facility or another vessel. A shift <PRTPAGE P="275"/>of cargo from one tank to another tank is not a transfer for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(2) Regardless of how long the transfer lasts beyond 4 hours, it counts as only one transfer.</P>
              <P>(3) A transfer must include both a commencement and a completion.</P>
              <P>(4) Regardless of how many tanks or products are being loaded or discharged at the same time, a person may receive credit for only one transfer, one loading, and one discharge conducted during each watch.</P>
              <P>(5) Credit for a transfer during a watch of less than 4 hours accrues only if the watch includes either the connection and the commencement of transfer or the completion of transfer and the disconnection.</P>
              <P>(6) Credit for a commencement of loading accrues only if the applicant participates in the pre-transfer inspection, the pre-transfer conference including execution of the Declaration of Inspection, the connection of hoses or loading-arms, the line-up of the system for the loading, the start of liquid flow, and the calculation of loading-rates, where applicable.</P>
              <P>(7) Credit for a commencement of discharge accrues only if the applicant participates in the pre-transfer inspection, the pre-transfer conference including execution of the Declaration of Inspection, the connection of hoses or loading-arms, the line-up of the cargo system for the discharge, the start of the pump or pumps and increase of pressure to normal pressure for discharge, and the monitoring of discharge rates.</P>
              <P>(8) Credit for a completion of transfer, whether loading or discharge, accrues only if the applicant participates in the topping-off at the loading port, or in the stripping of cargo tanks and the commencement of ballasting, if required by the vessel's transfer procedures, at the discharge port.</P>
              <P>(9) Personnel desiring credit for transfers during off-duty hours may satisfy requirements of competence through incremental training periods that include segments of transfers. The cumulative number of transfers must equal the minimum specified in §§ 13.203(b) or 13.303(b) of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(c) Service on Articulated Tug Barges (ATBs). Service on ATBs with an aggregate tonnage of 1,600 GRT or more will be creditable on a case-by-case basis and with prior authorization by the Coast Guard, provided the ATB equipment is comparable to tank vessel equipment. The Coast Guard may issue blanket authorizations for classes of ATBs.</P>

              <P>(a) Certain requirements of Title 46, United States Code do not apply to the employment of merchant mariners on oceanographic research vessels. These requirements are those concerned with, among other things, the shipment and discharge of mariners, their pay and allotments, and the adequacy of their clothing. 46 U.S.C. 2113(2) allows exemptions of oceanographic research vessels from certain requirements of parts B, C, F, or G of subtitle II of 46 U.S.C., upon such terms as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security deems suitable. The exemptions available under this subpart are subject to the following terms:</P>
              <P>(1) No use of any exemption relieves the owner, charterer, managing operator, master, or individual in charge of the vessel of other statutory responsibilities for the protection of every mariner under his or her command.</P>
              <P>(2) If it is presented at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner, the master or individual in charge must receive, consider, and appropriately address the legitimate complaint of any mariner.</P>
              <P>(b) For any oceanographic research vessel sailing with any mariner employed by any firm, association, corporation, or educational or governmental body or agency, the Commandant may grant exemptions from—</P>

The Coast Guard will issue a letter indicating any exemption granted. The master or individual in charge of the vessel must keep the letter aboard the vessel.</P>
              <P>(d) If operating conditions change, the owner, charterer, managing operator, master, or individual in charge of the vessel must so advise the Coast Guard . The Coast Guard will forward pertinent information on how the conditions have changed, along with his or her recommendation, to the Commandant, who will determine whether any exemption should remain granted.</P>

At least every 6 months, the person maintaining this record shall transmit it to the Coast Guard, either manually, in the form of a copy of a certificate of discharge, or electronically to the address provided in § 14.103 of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) The owner, charterer, managing operator, master, or individual in charge of the vessel must keep original shipping articles and a copy of each certificate of discharge ready for review by the Coast Guard or the concerned mariner upon request. The Coast Guard will no longer keep either original articles or copies of certificates of discharge; it will keep only electronic records of employment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The regulations in this part apply to all vessels that are subject to the manning requirements contained in the navigation and shipping laws of the United States, including uninspected vessels (46 U.S.C. 7101-9308).</P>
              <P>(b) The navigation and shipping laws state that a vessel may not be operated unless certain manning requirements are met. In addition to establishing a minimum number of officers and rated crew to be carried onboard certain vessels, they establish minimum qualifications concerning licenses and MMC endorsements, citizenship, and conditions of employment. It is the responsibility of the owner, charterer, managing operator, master, or person in charge or in command of the vessel to ensure that appropriate personnel are carried to meet the requirements of the applicable navigation and shipping laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(c) Inspected vessels are issued a Certificate of Inspection (COI) which indicates the minimum complement of officers and crew (including lifeboatmen) considered necessary for safe operation. The COI complements the statutory requirements but does not supersede them.</P>

              <P>(d) Uninspected vessels operating on an international voyage may be issued a safe manning certificate indicating the minimum complement of qualified mariners necessary for safe operation.<PRTPAGE P="292"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) The regulations in subpart K of this part apply to seagoing vessels subject to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended (STCW).</P>
              <P>(f) Persons serving on any of the following vessels, or any owner or operator of any of these vessels, do not need to meet the requirements of subpart K of this part, because the vessels are exempt from application of STCW:</P>
              <P>(1) Fishing vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(11)(a).</P>
              <P>(2) Fishing vessels used as fish-tender vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(11)(c).</P>
              <P>(3) Barges as defined in 46 U.S.C. 102, including non-self-propelled mobile offshore drilling units.</P>
              <P>(4) Vessels operating exclusively on the Great Lakes or on the inland waters of the U.S. in the Straits of Juan de Fuca or on the Inside Passage between Puget Sound and Cape Spencer.</P>
              <P>(5) Pilot vessels engaged on pilotage duty.</P>
              <P>(g) Owners and operators, and personnel serving on the following small vessels engaged exclusively on domestic, near-coastal voyages are in compliance with subpart K of this part and are, therefore, not subject to further requirements for the purposes of the STCW Convention:</P>
              <P>(1) Small passenger vessels subject to subchapter T or K of 46 CFR chapter I.</P>
              <P>(2) Vessels of less than 200 GRT, other than passenger vessels subject to subchapter H of 46 CFR chapter I.</P>
              <P>(3) Uninspected passenger vessels (UPVs) as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(42)(B).</P>
              <P>(h) Personnel serving on vessels identified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section may be issued, without additional proof of qualification, an appropriate STCW endorsement on their license or MMC when the Coast Guard determines that such an endorsement is necessary to enable the vessel to engage on a single international voyage of a non-routine nature. The STCW endorsement will be expressly limited to service on the vessel or the class of vessels and will not establish qualification for any other purpose.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Watches.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Title 46 U.S.C. 8104 applies to the establishment of watches aboard certain U.S. vessels. The establishment of adequate watches is the responsibility of the vessel's master. The Coast Guard interprets the term “watch” to be the direct performance of vessel operations, whether deck or engine, where such operations would routinely be controlled and performed in a scheduled and fixed rotation. The performance of maintenance or work necessary to the vessel's safe operation on a daily basis does not in itself constitute the establishment of a watch. The minimum safe manning levels specified in a vessel's COI or other safe manning document take into consideration routine maintenance requirements and ability of the crew to perform all operational evolutions, including emergencies, as well as those functions which may be assigned to persons in watches.</P>
              <P>(b) Subject to exceptions, 46 U.S.C. 8104 requires that when a master of a seagoing vessel of more than 100 GRT establishes watches for the officers, sailors, and oilers, “the personnel shall be divided, when at sea, into at least three watches and shall be kept on duty successively to perform ordinary work incidental to the operation and management of the vessel.” Solely for the purposes of this part, the Coast Guard interprets “sailors” to mean those members of the deck department other than officers, whose duties involve the mechanics of conducting the ship on its voyage, such as helmsman (wheelsman), lookout, etc., and which are necessary to the maintenance of a continuous watch. The term “sailors” is not interpreted to include able seamen and ordinary seamen not performing these duties.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) Subject to exceptions, 46 U.S.C. 8104(g) permits the officers and crew members to be divided into two watches when at sea and engaged on a voyage <PRTPAGE P="300"/>of less than 600 miles on the following categories of vessels—</P>
              <P>(i) Towing vessel;</P>
              <P>(ii) Offshore supply vessels, except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Barge.</P>
              <P>(2) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies to an OSV of at least 6,000 GT ITC (500 GRT if GT ITC is not assigned), as defined in § 125.160 of this chapter, if the individuals engaged on the vessel are in compliance with the work hours and rest period requirements in § 15.1111 of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) Subject to exceptions, 46 U.S.C. 8104(h) permits a master or mate (pilot) operating a towing vessel that is at least 8 meters (26 feet) in length measured from end to end over the deck (excluding sheer) to work not more than 12 hours in a consecutive 24-hour period except in an emergency. The Coast Guard interprets this, in conjunction with other provisions of the law, to permit masters or mates (pilots) serving as operators of towing vessels that are not subject to the provisions of the Officers' Competency Certificates Convention, 1936 (see 46 U.S.C. 8304), to be divided into two watches regardless of the length of the voyage.</P>
              <P>(e) Fish processing vessels are subject to various provisions of 46 U.S.C. 8104 concerning watches, including—</P>
              <P>(1) For fish processing vessels that entered into service before January 1, 1988, the following watch requirements apply to the officers and deck crew:</P>
              <P>(i) If more than 5,000 GRT—three watches.</P>
              <P>(ii) If more than 1,600 GRT and not more than 5,000 GRT—two watches.</P>
              <P>(iii) If not more than 1,600 GRT—no watch division specified; or</P>
              <P>(2) For fish processing vessels that entered into service after December 31, 1987, the following watch requirements apply to the officers and deck crew:</P>
              <P>(i) If more than 5,000 GRT—three watches.</P>
              <P>(ii) If not more than 5,000 GRT and having more than 16 individuals onboard, primarily employed in the preparation of fish or fish products—two watches.</P>
              <P>(iii) If not more than 5,000 GRT and having not more than 16 individuals onboard, primarily employed in the preparation of fish or fish products—no watch division specified.</P>
              <P>(f) Properly manned uninspected passenger vessels of at least 100 GRT—</P>
              <P>(1) Which are underway for no more than 12 hours in any 24-hour period, and which are adequately moored, anchored, or otherwise secured in a harbor of safe refuge for the remainder of that 24-hour period, may operate with one navigational watch;</P>
              <P>(2) Which are underway more than 12 hours in any 24-hour period, must provide a minimum of a two-watch system;</P>
              <P>(3) In no case may the crew of any watch work more than 12 hours in any 24-hour period, except in an emergency.</P>

However, under 46 U.S.C. 8104(f), the master or other credentialed officer can require any part of the crew to work when, in his or her judgment, they are needed for:</P>

              <P>(b) The OCMI considers the capabilities of an automated system in establishing initial manning levels; however, until the system is proven reliable, a manning level adequate to operate in a continuously attended mode will be specified on a vessel's COI. It remains the responsibility of the vessel's master to determine when a continuous watch is necessary.</P>

              <P>(a) United States vessels which need to replace one or more persons while on a foreign voyage and outside the jurisdiction of the United States, in order to meet manning requirements, may use non-U.S. credentialed personnel without a TWIC, except for the positions of master and radio officer, until the vessel returns to a port at which in the most expeditious manner replacements who are citizens of the United States can be obtained.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(c) The words <E T="03">able to understand any order spoken by the officers</E> relates to any order to a member of the crew when directing the performance of that person's duties and orders relating to emergency situations such as used for response to a fire or in using lifesaving equipment.

              <P>(d) Whenever information is presented to the Coast Guard that a vessel fails to comply with the specified language requirements the Coast Guard investigates the allegation to determine its validity. In determining if an allegation is factual, the Coast Guard may require a demonstration by the officers and crew that appropriate orders are understood. The demonstration will require that orders be spoken to the individual members of the crew by the officers in the language ordinarily and customarily used by the officers. The orders must be spoken directly by the officer to the crew member and not through an interpreter. Signs, gestures, or signals may not be used in the test. The Coast Guard representative will specify the orders to be given and will include not only daily routine but orders involving emergencies, either of a departmental or of a general nature. This test will be conducted, if possible, at a time reasonably in advance of the vessel's departure, to avoid delays.</P>

              <P>(b) Marine employers shall establish programs for the chemical testing for dangerous drugs on a random basis of crewmembers on uninspected vessels who:</P>
              <P>(1) Are required by law or regulation to hold a license issued by the Coast Guard in order to perform their duties on the vessel;</P>

              <P>(c) The selection of crewmembers for random drug testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with crewmembers' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the testing frequency and selection process used, each covered crewmember shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made and an employee's chance of selection shall continue to exist throughout his or her employment. As an alternative, random selection may be accomplished by periodically selecting one or more vessels and testing all crewmembers covered by this section, provided that each vessel subject to the marine employer's test program remains equally subject to selection.<PRTPAGE P="324"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) Marine employers may form or otherwise use sponsoring organizations, or may use contractors, to conduct the random chemical testing programs required by this part.</P>
              <P>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered crewmembers.</P>
              <P>(f) The annual rate for random drug testing may be adjusted in accordance with this paragraph.</P>

              <P>(1) The Commandant's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported random positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Commandant considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from marine employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry random positive rate. Each year, the Commandant will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered crewmembers. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication.</P>
              <P>(2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Commandant may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered crewmembers if the Commandant determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of 46 CFR 16.500 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the positive rate is less than 1.0 percent.</P>
              <P>(3) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of 46 CFR 16.500 for any calendar year indicate that the positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Commandant will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50 percent of all covered crewmembers.</P>
              <P>(g) Marine employers shall randomly select a sufficient number of covered crewmembers for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing determined by the Commandant. If the marine employer conducts random drug testing through a consortium, the number of crewmembers to be tested may be calculated for each individual marine employer or may be based on the total number of covered crewmembers covered by the consortium who are subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this part or any DOT drug testing rule.</P>
              <P>(h) Each marine employer shall ensure that random drug tests conducted under this part are unannounced and that the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.</P>
              <P>(i) If a given covered crewmember is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same marine employer, the crewmember shall be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the crewmember's function.</P>
              <P>(j) If a marine employer is required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the marine employer may—</P>
              <P>(1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered crewmembers who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or</P>
              <P>(2) Randomly select such crewmembers for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the marine employer is subject.</P>

              <P>(k) An individual may not be engaged or employed, including self-employment, on a vessel in a position as master, operator, or person in charge for which a credential is required by law or regulation unless all crewmembers covered by this section are subject to the <PRTPAGE P="325"/>random testing requirements of this section.</P>

The following maintenance and inspections are required for such extinguishers:</P>
              <P>(1) When the date on the inspection record tag on the extinguishers shows that 6 months have elapsed since the last weight check ashore, then such extinguishers are no longer accepted as meeting required maintenance conditions until they are reweighed ashore, found to be in a serviceable condition, and within required weight conditions.</P>
              <P>(2) If the weight of the container is <FR>1/4</FR> ounce less than that stamped on the container, it must be serviced.</P>
              <P>(3) If the outer seal or seals (which indicate tampering or use when broken) are not intact, the boarding officer or marine inspector will inspect such extinguishers to see that the frangible disc in the neck of the container is intact; and if such disc is not intact, the container must be serviced.</P>
              <P>(4) If there is evidence of damage, use, or leakage, such as dry chemical powder observed in the nozzle or elsewhere on the extinguisher, the extinguisher must be serviced or replaced.</P>
              <P>(i) Dry chemical extinguishers, stored pressure extinguishers, and fire extinguishers without pressure gauges or indicating devices manufactured after January 1, 1965, cannot be labeled with the marine type label described in 46 CFR 162.028-4. These extinguishers manufactured after January 1, 1965, may be carried onboard motorboats or other vessels as excess equipment.</P>
              <P>(j) Semi-portable extinguishers must be fitted with a suitable hose and nozzle, or other practicable means, so that all portions of the space concerned may be covered.</P>

              <P>(a) You must have a fire detection system installed on your vessel to detect engine-room fires. Any owner of a vessel whose construction was contracted for before January 18, 2000, may use an existing engine-room-monitoring system (with fire detection capability) instead of a fire detection system, if the monitoring system is operable and complies with this section. You must ensure that—</P>

              <P>(1) Each detector, each control panel, and each fire alarm are approved under 46 CFR subpart 161.002 or listed by an independent testing laboratory; except that, if you use an existing engine-room-monitoring system (with fire detection capability), each detector must be listed by a nationally recognized <PRTPAGE P="348"/>testing laboratory (NRTL), as defined in 46 CFR 161.002-2, for fire service;</P>
              <P>(2) The system is installed, tested, and maintained in line with the manufacturer's design manual;</P>
              <P>(3) The system is arranged and installed so a fire in the engine room automatically sets off alarms on a control panel at the operating station;</P>
              <P>(4) The control panel includes—</P>
              <P>(i) A power-available light;</P>
              <P>(ii) Both an audible alarm to notify crew at the operating station of fire and visible alarms to identify the zone or zones of origin of the fire;</P>
              <P>(iii) A means to silence the audible alarm while maintaining indication by the visible alarms;</P>
              <P>(iv) A circuit-fault detector test-switch; and</P>
              <P>(v) Labels for all switches and indicator lights, identifying their functions;</P>
              <P>(5) The system draws power from two sources, switchover from the primary source to the secondary source being either manual or automatic;</P>
              <P>(6) The system serves no other purpose, unless it is an engine-room-monitoring system (with fire detection capability) installed on a vessel whose construction was contracted for before January 18, 2000; and</P>
              <P>(7) The system is certified by a registered professional engineer, or by a recognized classification society (under 46 CFR part 8), to comply with paragraphs (a) introductory text and (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) In spaces other than the engine room, non-approved fire detection systems may be acceptable as excess equipment provided that—</P>
              <P>(1) Components are listed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory (NRTL) as set forth in 29 CFR 1910.7, and is designed, installed, tested, and maintained in accordance with an appropriate industry standard and the manufacturer's specific guidance; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Survival craft.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section and 28.305, each vessel must carry the survival craft specified in table 28.120(a), table 28.120(b), or table 28.120(c), as appropriate for the vessel, in an aggregate capacity to accommodate the total number of individuals on board.</P>
              <P>(b) The requirements of this section do not apply to vessels less than 10.97 meters (36 feet) in length with 3 or fewer individuals on board which operate within 12 miles of the coastline.</P>
              <P>(c) A buoyant apparatus may be substituted instead of the requirements in this section for vessels 10.97 meters (36 feet) or more in length with 3 or fewer individuals on board which operate within 12 miles of the coastline.</P>
              <P>(d) Each survival craft installed on board a vessel before September 15, 1991, may continue to be used to meet the requirements of this section provided the survival craft is—</P>
              <P>(1) Of the same type as required in tables 28.120(a), 28.120(b), or 28.120(c), as appropriate for the vessel type; and</P>
              <P>(2) Maintained in good and serviceable condition.</P>
              <P>(e) Each inflatable liferaft installed on board a vessel before September 15, 1991, may continue to be used to meet the requirements for an approved inflatable liferaft, provided the existing liferaft is—</P>
              <P>(1) Maintained in good and serviceable condition as required by table 28.140; and</P>
              <P>(2) Equipped with the equipment pack required by tables 28.120(a), 28.120(b), or 28.120(c), as appropriate for the vessel type. Where no equipment pack is specified in tables 28.120(a), 28.120(b), or 28.120(c), a coastal service pack is the minimum required.</P>
              <P>(f) A lifeboat may be substituted for any survival craft required by this section, provided it is arranged and equipped in accordance with part 199 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(g) The capacity of an auxiliary craft carried on board a vessel that is integral to and necessary for normal fishing operations will satisfy the requirements of this section for survival craft, except for an inflatable liferaft, provided the craft is readily accessible during an emergency and is capable of safely holding all individuals on board the vessel. If the auxiliary craft is equipped with a Coast Guard required capacity plate, the boat must not be loaded so as to exceed the rated capacity.</P>
              <P>(h) A vessel less than 10.97 meters (36 feet) in length that meets the flotation provisions of 33 CFR part 183 is exempt from the requirement for survival craft in paragraph (a) of this section for operation on—</P>
              <P>(1) Any waters within 12 miles of the coastline.</P>
              <P>(2) Rivers.</P>

The rules provide maximum flexibility for owners and qualified individuals to determine how this information is conveyed, taking into consideration decisions by operating personnel must be made quickly and that few operating personnel in the commercial fishing industry have had specialized training in stability. Therefore, stability instructions should take into account the conditions a vessel may reasonably be expected to encounter and provide simple guidance for the operating personnel to deal with these situations.</P>

Units of measure, language, and rigor of calculations in the stability instructions must be consistent with the ability of the master or the individual in charge of the vessel. The format of the stability instructions may include, at the owner's discretion, any of the following:</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> Except for an open boat that operates on protected waters and as provided by paragraph (i) of this section, each vessel built on or after September 15, 1991 must comply with the requirements of this section.<PRTPAGE P="389"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Collision bulkhead.</E> A watertight collision bulkhead must be fitted and must meet the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Openings in the collision bulkhead must be kept to a minimum, and each must be fitted with a watertight closure device;</P>
              <P>(2) A collision bulkhead must not be fitted with a door below the bulkhead deck;</P>
              <P>(3) A penetration or opening in a collision bulkhead must be—</P>
              <P>(i) Located as high and as far inboard as practicable; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Fitted with a means to rapidly make it watertight which is operable from a location aft of the collision bulkhead;</P>
              <P>(4) The collision bulkhead must be located at least 5 percent of the length from the forward perpendicular unless the vessel has a bulbous bow, in which case the forward reference point will be extended by half the distance between the vessel's forward perpendicular and the forwardmost point of the bulbous bow as shown in figure 28.580; and</P>
              <P>(5) The collision bulkhead must not be stepped below the bulkhead deck.</P>
              <P>(c) Each vessel must meet the survival conditions in paragraph (f) of this section in each condition of loading and operation with the extent and character of damage specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Extent and character of damage.</E> Except where a lesser extent of damage or a smaller penetration would be more disabling, in evaluating the damage stability of a vessel the following penetration must be assumed:</P>
              <P>(1) Longitudinal extent—L/10, or 10 feet (3.05 meters) plus 0.03L, whichever is less. Transverse watertight bulkheads that are separated by at least this distance may be assumed to remain effective;</P>
              <P>(2) Transverse extent—30 inches (0.76 meters) from the side measured at right angles to the centerline at the level of the deepest operating waterline; and</P>
              <P>(3) Vertical extent—from the baseline upward without limit.</P>
              <P>(e) Each space containing a through hull fitting, such as the lazarette and the engineroom, must be assumed to be flooded.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Survival conditions.</E> A vessel is presumed to survive the assumed damage and unintentional flooding described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section if:</P>
              <P>(1) The angle of equilibrium after flooding does not exceed 25° (0.44 radians); and</P>
              <P>(2) Through an angle of 20° (0.35 radians) beyond the angle of equilibrium after flooding, the following are met—</P>
              <P>(i) The righting arm curve is positive;</P>
              <P>(ii) The maximum righting arm is at least 4 inches (102 millimeters);</P>
              <P>(iii) Each submerged opening is capable of being made weathertight; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The heeling arm caused by deploying all fully loaded davit-launched survival craft on one side of a vessel does not exceed the righting arm at any angle of heel beyond the equilibrium angle when launching is assumed on the damaged side.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Permeability.</E> The permeability of each space must not be less than the following:</P>
              <P>(1) For an accommodations space—95 percent;</P>
              <P>(2) For a propulsion machinery space—85 percent;</P>
              <P>(3) For a tightly packed storage space—60 percent;</P>
              <P>(4) For a void or an auxiliary machinery space—95 percent;</P>
              <P>(5) For an empty fish hold—95 percent;</P>
              <P>(6) For a full fish hold—50 percent; and</P>
              <P>(7) For tanks—95 percent (less if a tank must be full to attain the draft under consideration.)</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Buoyancy of superstructure.</E> A deckhouse or a superstructure may be included in the buoyant volume of a vessel provided it is:</P>
              <P>(1) Sufficiently strong to withstand the impact of waves;</P>
              <P>(2) Fitted with a weathertight or watertight closure device for each opening;</P>
              <P>(3) Equipped with an efficient, hinged, inside deadlight, for each window and each portlight, arranged so that it can be effectively closed watertight; and</P>
              <P>(4) Fitted with interior access from the spaces below.</P>

              <P>(i) A vessel may obtain and maintain a Load Line Certificate under subchapter E of this chapter in lieu of <PRTPAGE P="390"/>meeting the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) As set forth in 46 U.S.C. 8103, a citizenship requirement, other than a requirement that applies to the master of a documented vessel, on commercial fishing vessels may be waived for unlicensed seamen when qualified seamen who are citizens of the United States are not available. Under the provisions of this subpart, the Coast Guard approves or denies requests for a waiver of the citizenship requirement from owners, operators, or employers seeking to exceed the 25 percent limit applicable to unlicensed seamen aboard fishing industry vessels who are non-permanent resident aliens authorized for employment in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
              <P>(b) This subpart does not apply to a fishing vessel fishing exclusively for highly migratory species (as that term is defined in section 3 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802)).</P>
              <P>(c) The regulations in this subpart have preemptive effect over State or local regulation within the same field.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(1) Passenger vessels:</P>
              <P>(i) Grade E in an integral tank; and</P>

              <P>(c) The vessels and services to which each regulation applies are indicated by letters in the heading of the section or paragraph. The first letter or two letters indicate the type of vessel and the letter or letters following the oblique line indicate the waters in which such vessels may operate. These letters are described as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) “T” signifies a tankship.</P>
              <P>(2) “B” signifies a tank barge when it precedes an oblique line; or it signifies service on bays, sounds, and lakes other than the Great Lakes when it follows an oblique line.</P>

              <P>(3) With the exception of vessels of the U.S. Maritime Administration, any vessel with title vested in the United States and which is used for public purposes.</P>
              <P>(e) This subchapter shall be applicable to all foreign flag vessels carrying combustible or flammable liquid cargo in bulk while in the navigable waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, except that:</P>
              <P>(1) A vessel of a foreign nation signatory to the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, which has on board a current valid Safety Equipment Certificate, or a vessel of a foreign nation having inspection laws approximating those of the United States, together with reciprocal inspection arrangements with the United States and which has on board a current valid certificate of inspection issued by its government under such arrangements, in either case, shall be subject only to the requirements of § 35.01-1 and the safety and cargo handling requirements in subparts 35.30 and 35.35 of this subchapter. In addition, these vessels shall report marine casualties occurring while they are in the navigable waters of the United States as required by subpart 35.15.</P>
              <P>(2) A foreign flag vessel, except a public vessel, which operates on or enters the navigable waters of the United States, or which transfers oil in any port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, must comply with the provisions of § 31.10-21a and subparts 32.53, 32.59 and 34.05 of this chapter, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(f) Notwithstanding the exceptions previously noted in paragraph (e) of this section, foreign vessels of novel design or construction, or whose operation involves potential unusual risks, shall be subject to inspection to the extent necessary to safeguard life and property in United States ports, as further provided by § 2.01-13 of subchapter A (Procedures applicable to the Public) of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(g) Manned barges carrying any of the cargoes listed in table 30.25-1 will <PRTPAGE P="404"/>be considered individually by the Commandant and may be required to comply with the requirements of subchapter O of this chapter, as applicable, as well as the requirements of this subchapter.</P>

              <P>(a) On all tank vessels, the construction or conversion of which is started on or after July 1, 1951, the cargo piping shall be:</P>
              <P>(1) A fixed cargo piping system shall be installed on a tank vessel carrying Grade A, B, or C cargo. The piping shall be arranged so as to avoid excessive stresses at the joints. For sizes exceeding 2 inches in diameter, flanged, welded, or other approved types of joints shall be employed. Packing material shall be suitable for the cargo carried. Connections at bulkheads shall be made so that the plating does not form part of a flanged joint. Piping may be carried through bunker spaces and deep tanks provided it is run through a pipe tunnel. The tunnel may be omitted where the pipe is extra heavy, all joints are welded, and bends are installed to provide for expansion and contraction.</P>
              <P>(2) Tank vessels carrying only Grades D and E cargo may use a portable piping system in lieu of a fixed piping system meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provided:</P>
              <P>(i) The hose complies with 33 CFR 154.500 or the portable piping complies with part 56 of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(ii) The connections comply with 33 CFR 156.130;</P>
              <P>(iii) A shutoff valve is at or near the point of entry into the tank;</P>
              <P>(iv) Except for the carriage of animal fats and vegetable oils, the system has a closure which forms a vapor-tight seal on the tank opening through which the cargo is transferred, is bolted or dogged in place, and has the hose and drop line connected to it; and</P>
              <P>(v) Except for the carriage of animal fats and vegetable oils, the system has a metallic drop line which complies with 46 CFR 153.282.</P>

              <P>(3) Cargo piping shall not pass through spaces containing machinery where sources of vapor ignition are normally present: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, in special cases the Commandant may permit the piping to pass through such spaces if Grade E liquids only are involved.</P>
              <P>(b) Valve operating rods in cargo tanks shall be solid, except that tank barges having plug cocks inside the cargo tanks may have operating rods of extra heavy pipe with the annular space between the lubricant tube and the pipe wall sealed with a nonsoluble material to prevent penetration of the cargo. Valve operating rods shall be of ample size, well guided and supported, and attached to the valve stems in a manner so as to prevent the operating rods from working loose. Where the operating rods pass through a deck, gastight stuffing boxes shall be fitted. The leads of operating rods shall be as direct as possible. Valves shall be of suitable design for the intended service.</P>
              <P>(c) All cargo loading and discharge hose connections shall be fitted with valves or blind flanges.</P>

              <P>(1) Independent tanks may be installed in such a manner that they do not contribute to the strength and stiffness of the barge. In such case, the hull stress shall not exceed either 50 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the material or 70 percent of the yield strength when specified, whichever is greater.</P>
              <P>(2) The Commandant may consider a reduction in hull stress when independent tanks are installed in such a manner as to contribute to the strength and stiffness of the barge and this is accounted for in determining the effective section modulus of the barge. In such case, the hull stress shall not exceed the percentage stress values prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section multiplied by the quantity (1.5−SWT/UTS), where SWT is the stress calculated without including the effect of the tanks, and UTS is the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the material. The value SWT, however, shall in no case be more than 75 percent of UTS.</P>

              <P>(a) The provisions of “Standard for the Control of Gas Hazards on Vessels to be Repaired,” NFPA No. 306, published by National Fire Protection Association, 1 Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02269, shall be used as a guide in conducting the inspections and issuance of certificates required by this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Until an inspection has been made to determine that such operation can be undertaken with safety, no alterations, repairs, or other such operations involving riveting, welding, burning, or like fire-producing actions shall be made:</P>
              <P>(1) Within or on the boundaries of cargo tanks which have been used to carry flammable or combustible liquid or chemicals in bulk, or within spaces adjacent to such cargo tanks; or,</P>
              <P>(2) Within or on the boundaries of fuel tanks; or,</P>
              <P>(3) To pipe lines, heating coils, pumps, fittings, or other appurtenances connected to such cargo or fuel tanks.</P>
              <P>(c) Such inspections shall be made and evidenced as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) In ports or places in the United States or its territories and possessions, the inspection shall be made by a marine chemist certificated by the National Fire Protection Association; however, if the services of such certified marine chemist are not reasonably available, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, upon the recommendation of the vessel owner and his contractor or their representative, shall select a person who, in the case of an individual vessel, shall be authorized to make such inspection. If the inspection indicates that such operations can be undertaken with safety, a certificate setting forth the fact in writing and qualified as may be required, shall be issued by the certified marine chemist or the authorized person before the work is started. Such qualifications shall include any requirements as may be deemed necessary to maintain, insofar as can reasonably be done, the safe conditions in the spaces certified, throughout the operation and shall include such additional tests and certifications as considered required. Such qualifications and requirements shall include precautions necessary to eliminate or minimize hazards that may be present from protective coatings or residues from cargoes.</P>
              <P>(2) When not in such a port or place, and a marine chemist or such person authorized by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, is not reasonably available, the inspection shall be made by the senior officer present and a proper entry shall be made in the vessel's logbook.</P>
              <P>(d) It shall be the responsibility of the senior officer present to secure copies of certificates issued by the certified marine chemist or such person authorized by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. It shall be the responsibility of the senior officer present, insofar as the persons under his control are concerned, to maintain a safe condition on the vessel by full observance of all qualifications and requirements listed by the marine chemist in the certificate.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Open hopper type barges—B/ALL.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) With the exception of those open hopper type barges constructed or modified in conformance with the requirements of subpart 32.63 of this subchapter, the special operating conditions in this section apply to all other open hopper type barges carrying those cargoes listed in table 30.25-1, of this chapter, which are defined as:</P>
              <P>(1) Flammable liquids having a Reid vapor pressure in excess of 25 pounds per square inch, absolute, in independent tanks (part 32 of this subchapter).</P>
              <P>(2) Liquefied flammable gases (part 38 of this subchapter).</P>
              <P>(b) All open hopper type barges, while carrying in bulk any of the cargoes described in paragraph (a) of this section, shall be operated in conformance with the provisions in this section. However, the provisions in this section are not applicable to such barges when empty (not necessarily cleaned or gas-freed).</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no such open hopper type barge shall be placed as a lead barge in any tow. Such barges shall be placed in protected positions within the tow so that the danger from diving or swamping will be minimized. Where, due to operating conditions, compliance with this paragraph is impossible, the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section apply. The person in charge of the towing vessels shall be responsible for compliance with this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(2) No such open hopper type barge shall be moved from a loading facility unless all void spaces and bilges are substantially free of water. Periodic inspections and necessary pumping shall be carried out to insure the maintenance of such water-free conditions, in order to minimize the free surface effect in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. Except when otherwise considered necessary for inspection or pumping, all hatch covers and other hull closure devices for void spaces and hull compartments shall be closed and secured at all times. In the case of unmanned barges, the person in charge of the towing vessel shall be deemed to be in charge of the barge, and all requirements to be carried out on the barge shall be carried out by or under the direction of such person.</P>
              <P>(3) When an open hopper type barge is in an exposed position, such that protection from swamping provided by adjoining barges cannot be obtained from location within the two alone, it shall be the responsibility of the person in charge of the towing vessel to control speed so as to insure protection against diving and swamping of the barge, having due regard to its design and freeboard, and to the operating conditions.</P>

              <P>(d) To show that special operating requirements apply to a specific open hopper type barge, additional placards <PRTPAGE P="494"/>or signs shall be displayed in at least four different locations on the barge when the cargoes described in paragraph (a) of this section are carried in any form in the cargo tanks. The placards or signs shall be posted on the barge approximately amidships on each side and near the centerline of each end, facing outboard. Racks, or other suitable means, for mounting such placards or signs shall be so arranged as to provide clear visibility and shall be protected from becoming readily damaged or obscured. The placards or signs shall be at least equal in dimensions to the DOT standard tank car “Dangerous” placard (10<FR>3/4</FR> inches square or larger), and shall display a circle (10 inches in diameter or larger) with alternating quadrants of white and red, and so mounted that the red quadrants are centered on the vertical axis. The shipper and/or owner of the barge shall be responsible for the installation of the required placards or signs, including maintenance of them while such barge is in temporary storage with cargo aboard. The person in charge of the towing vessel shall be responsible for the continued maintenance of the placards or signs while such barge is in transit.</P>

              <P>(2) A towing vessel engaged in transporting such unmanned barges shall not leave them unattended. When a barge is moored, but not gas free, it shall be under the observation of a watchman who may be a member of the complement of the towing vessel, or a terminal employee, or other person. Such person shall be responsible for the security of the barge and for keeping unauthorized persons off the barge.</P>

              <P>(g) The owner, operator, master, or person in charge of any barge carrying dangerous cargoes described in paragraph (a) of this section shall insure that, while the barge is being towed and during cargo transfer operations, the persons as required by § 31.15-5 of <PRTPAGE P="495"/>this subchapter and § 35.35-1 are provided.</P>

              <P>(c) In the design of the tank, consideration shall be given to the possibility of the tank being subjected to external loads. Consideration shall also be given to excessive loads that can be imposed on the tanks by their support due to static and dynamic forces under operating conditions or during testing. The design shall show the manner in which the tanks are to be installed, supported, and secured, and shall be approved prior to tank installation.</P>
              <P>(d) Tanks with a service temperature of minus 20 °F. or lower and fabricated of ferritic materials shall be stress relieved.</P>
