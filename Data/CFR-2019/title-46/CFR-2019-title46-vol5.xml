      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Survival craft requirements for towing vessels.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General purpose.</E> Survival craft provide a means for survival when evacuation from the towing vessel is necessary. The craft and related equipment should be selected so as to provide for the basic needs of the crew, such as shelter from life threatening elements, until rescue resources are expected to arrive, taking into account the scope and nature of the towing vessel's operations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Functional requirements.</E> A towing vessel's survival craft must meet the functional requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section. Functional requirements describe the objectives of the regulation. Survival craft must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be readily accessible;</P>
              <P>(2) Have an aggregate capacity sufficient to accommodate the total number of individuals onboard, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section;</P>

              <P>(3) Provide a means for sheltering its complement appropriate to the route;<PRTPAGE P="19"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Provide minimum equipment for survival if recovery time is expected to be greater than 24 hours; and</P>
              <P>(5) Be marked so that an individual not familiar with the operation of the specific survival craft has sufficient guidance to utilize the craft for its intended use.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance options.</E> A towing vessel must meet the applicable functional requirements. Compliance with the functional requirements of paragraph (b) of this section may be met by one of these two options:</P>
              <P>(1) A towing vessel that meets the prescriptive requirements of paragraph (d) of this section will have complied with the functional requirements; or</P>
              <P>(2) If an owner or managing operator chooses to meet the functional requirement through means other than as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the means must be accepted by the cognizant OCMI or, if the vessel has a TSMS, then by a TPO and, in the latter case, documented in the TSMS applicable to the vessel. The design, testing, and examination scheme for meeting these functional requirements must be included as part of the TSMS applicable to the vessel.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Prescriptive requirements.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) through (4) of this section, each towing vessel must carry the survival craft specified in Table 141.305 of this section, as appropriate for the towing vessel, in an aggregate capacity to accommodate the total number of individuals onboard.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General requirements for propulsion, steering, and related controls on vessels that move tank barges carrying oil or hazardous material in bulk.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) There must be an alternate means to control the propulsion and steering system which must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be independent of the primary control required by § 143.225;</P>
              <P>(2) Be located at or near the propulsion and steering equipment; and</P>
              <P>(3) Be readily accessible and suitable for prolonged operation.</P>
              <P>(b) There must be a means to communicate between each operating station and the alternate propulsion and steering controls.</P>
              <P>(c) There must be a means to stop each propulsion engine and steering motor from each operating station.</P>
              <P>(d) The means to monitor the amount of thrust, rudder angle, and if applicable, direction (ahead or astern) of thrust must be independent of the controls required by § 143.225.</P>
              <P>(e) The propulsion control system required by § 143.225 must be designed so that, in the event of a single failure of any component of the system, propeller speed and direction of thrust are maintained or reduced to zero.</P>

              <P>(f) On a towing vessel with an integrated steering and propulsion system, such as a Z-drive, the control system required by § 143.225 must be designed so that, in the event of a single failure of any component of the system, propeller speed and direction of thrust are <PRTPAGE P="42"/>maintained or the propeller speed is reduced to zero.</P>
              <P>(g) An audible and visual alarm must actuate at each operating station when:</P>
              <P>(1) The propulsion control system fails;</P>
              <P>(2) A non-follow up steering control system fails, if installed; and</P>
              <P>(3) The ordered rudder angle does not match the actual rudder position on a follow-up steering control system, if installed. This alarm must have an appropriate delay and error tolerance to eliminate nuisance alarms.</P>
              <P>(h) Alarms must be separate and independent of the control system required by § 143.225.</P>
              <P>(i) A means of communication must be provided between each operating station and any crewmember(s) required to respond to alarms.</P>
              <P>(j) The two sources of electricity required by § 143.555(a)(3) and (b)(8) must be capable of powering electrical loads needed to maintain propulsion, steering, and related controls for not less than 3 hours.</P>
              <P>(k) The second source of supply required by § 143.555(a)(3) must automatically start to help restore or maintain power to propulsion, steering, and related controls when the main power source fails.</P>
              <P>(l) Propulsion, steering, or related controls that are directly reliant on stored energy, such as compressed air, battery power, or hydraulic pressure, must have two independent stored energy systems, such as compressed air cylinders, battery banks, or hydraulic cylinders, that are capable of maintaining the vessel's propulsion, steering, and related controls.</P>
              <P>(m) After a power failure, electrical motors used to maintain propulsion and steering must automatically restart when power is restored, unless remote control starting is provided at the operating station.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Propulsor redundancy on vessels that move tank barges carrying oil or hazardous material in bulk.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A towing vessel must be provided with at least two independent propulsors unless the requirements of § 143.595 are met.</P>
              <P>(b) There must be independent controls for each propulsor at each operating station.</P>
              <P>(c) In the event of a failure of a single propulsor, the remaining propulsor(s) must have sufficient power to maneuver the vessel to a safe location.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Vessels with one propulsor that move tank barges carrying oil or hazardous material in bulk.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A towing vessel must have independent, duplicate vital auxiliaries. For the purpose of this section, vital auxiliaries are the equipment necessary to operate the propulsion engine, and include fuel pumps, lubricating oil pumps, and cooling water pumps. In the event of a failure or malfunction of any single vital auxiliary, the propulsion engine must continue to provide propulsion adequate to maintain control of the tow.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of a failure, the corresponding independent duplicate vital auxiliary, described in paragraph (a) of this section, must be fully capable of assuming the operation of the failed unit.</P>

              <P>(1) Cylinders must be retested at least every 12 years. If a cylinder is discharged and more than 5 years have elapsed since the last test, it must be retested before recharging.</P>
              <P>(2) Carbon dioxide cylinders must be rejected for further service when they:</P>
              <P>(i) Leak;</P>
              <P>(ii) Are dented, bulging, severely corroded, or otherwise in a weakened condition;</P>
              <P>(iii) Have lost more than 5 percent of their tare weight; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Have been involved in a fire.</P>
              <P>(3) Cylinders which have contained gas agents for fixed fire extinguishing systems and have not been tested within 5 years must not be used to contain another compressed gas onboard a vessel, unless the cylinders are retested and re-marked in accordance with § 147.60(a)(3) and (4).</P>
              <P>(4) Flexible connections between cylinders and distribution piping of semi-portable or fixed carbon dioxide fire extinguishing systems and discharge hoses in semi-portable carbon dioxide fire extinguishing systems must be replaced or tested at a pressure of 6.9 MPa (1,000 psig). At test pressure, the pressure must not drop at a rate greater than 1.03 MPa (150 psi) per minute for a 2-minute period. The test must be performed when the cylinders are retested.</P>
              <P>(b) Halon cylinders forming part of a fixed fire extinguishing system must be maintained as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The agent weight must be ascertained annually by one of the methods identified in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section. Measured weights or liquid levels must be recorded and compared with the recommended fill levels and previous readings. If cylinder weight or liquid level, adjusted for temperature, shows a 5 percent loss of pressure, the cylinder must be refilled. If cylinder pressure, adjusted for temperature, shows a 10 percent loss of pressure, the cylinders must be refilled.</P>
              <P>(2) The cylinders may be removed from the mounting racks and weighed.</P>
              <P>(3) The contents of cylinders fitted with integral floating dipstick liquid level indicators may be measured with the dipstick indicator.</P>
              <P>(4) With approval of the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI), liquid level indication measures such as ultrasonic/audio gauging or radioisotope gauging may be used, provided that all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) Measurement equipment is calibrated for the cylinder wall thickness and Halon liquid.</P>
              <P>(ii) Calibration is verified by weighing the cylinders that indicate the lowest levels of Halon in each release group, but in no case less than 10 percent of the inspected cylinders in each release group.</P>
              <P>(iii) The acceptable liquid level is identified by the original system installer or coincides with all other cylinder liquid levels of the same release group.</P>
              <P>(iv) Measurements are made by personnel skilled in ultrasonic/audio gauging or radioisotope gauging techniques.</P>

              <P>(5) Effective 12 years after commissioning of the system or 5 years after the last hydrostatic test, whichever is <PRTPAGE P="57"/>later, the following inspections must be completed every 5 years:</P>
              <P>(i) Cylinders continuously in service without discharging must be removed from mounting racks and given a complete external visual inspection. The inspection must be conducted in accordance with the CGA Pamphlet C-6 (incorporated by reference, see § 147.7).</P>
              <P>(ii) The volume of agent must be ascertained either by removing and weighing the cylinder or by floating liquid level indicators, integral with the cylinder construction, taking into account adjustments necessary for cylinder temperature and pressure.</P>
              <P>(6) Flexible connections between cylinders and distribution piping of fixed Halon fire extinguishing systems must be:</P>
              <P>(i) Visually inspected for damage, corrosion, or deterioration every year and replaced if found unserviceable; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Inspected and tested in accordance with NFPA 12A, paragraph 6.3.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 147.7) except that hydrostatic testing must be performed every 12 years instead of every 5 years.</P>
              <P>(7) During any inspection, cylinders must be removed from service if they:</P>
              <P>(i) Leak;</P>
              <P>(ii) Are dented, bulging, severely corroded, or otherwise in a weakened condition; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Have been involved in a fire.</P>
              <P>(c) Cylinders that have contained carbon dioxide or Halon and have not been tested within 5 years must not be used to contain another compressed gas onboard a vessel, unless the cylinder is retested and re-marked in accordance with § 147.60(a)(3) and (4).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part prescribes special handling procedures for certain solid materials that present hazards when transported in bulk by vessel.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as noted in paragraph (c) of this section, this part applies to all domestic and foreign vessels in the navigable waters of the United States that transport bulk solid materials requiring special handling.</P>
              <P>(c) This part does not apply to an unmanned barge on a domestic voyage carrying a Potentially Dangerous Material (PDM) found in Table 148.10 of this part. All barges on international voyages must follow the requirements for PDM.</P>

              <P>(d) The regulations in this part have preemptive impact over State law on the same subject. The Coast Guard has determined, after considering the factors developed by the Supreme Court in <E T="03">U.S.</E> v. <E T="03">Locke,</E> 529 U.S. 89 (2000), that in directing the Secretary to regulate the safe transportation of hazardous material and the safety of individuals and property on board vessels subject to inspection, as well as the provision of loading information, Congress intended to preempt the field of safety standards for solid materials requiring special handling when transported in bulk on vessels.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Permitted materials.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) A material listed in Table 148.10 of this section may be transported as a <PRTPAGE P="67"/>bulk solid cargo on a vessel if it is carried according to this part. A material that is not listed in Table 148.10 of this section, but which is hazardous or a Potentially Dangerous Material (PDM), requires a Special Permit under § 148.15 of this part to be transported on the navigable waters of the United States.</P>
              <P>(b) For each listed material, Table 148.10 identifies the hazard class and gives the BCSN or directs the user to the preferred BCSN. In addition, the table lists specific hazardous or potentially dangerous characteristics associated with each material and specifies or references detailed special requirements in this part pertaining to the stowage or transport of specific bulk solid materials. The column descriptions for Table 148.10 are defined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Column 1: Bulk Solid Material Descriptions and Bulk Cargo Shipping Names (BCSN).</E> Column 1 lists the bulk solid material descriptions and the BCSNs of materials designated as hazardous or PDM. BCSNs are limited to those shown in Roman type. Trade names and additional descriptive text are shown in italics.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Column 2: I.D. Number.</E> Column 2 lists the identification number assigned to each BCSN associated with a hazardous material. Those preceded by the letters “UN” are associated with BCSNs considered appropriate for international voyages as well as domestic voyages. Those preceded by the letters “NA” are associated with BCSNs not recognized for international voyages, except to and from Canada.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Column 3: Hazard Class or Division.</E> Column 3 designates the hazard class or division, or PDM, as appropriate, corresponding to each BCSN.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Column 4: References.</E> Column 4 refers the user to the preferred BCSN corresponding to bulk solid material descriptions listed in Column 1.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Column 5: Hazardous or Potentially Dangerous Characteristics.</E> Column 5 specifies codes for hazardous or potentially dangerous characteristics applicable to specific hazardous materials or PDMs. Refer to § 148.11 of this part for the meaning of each code.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Column 6: Other Characteristics.</E> Column 6 contains other pertinent characteristics applicable to specific bulk solid materials listed in Column 1.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Column 7: Special Requirements.</E> Column 7 specifies the applicable sections of Part 148 of this chapter that contain detailed special requirements pertaining to stowage and/or transportation of specific bulk solid materials in this part. This column is completed in a manner which indicates that “§ 148.” precedes the designated numerical entry.</P>
              <P>(c) The following requirements apply to combinations of bulk solids carried at the same time and in the same compartment or hold:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Stowage and segregation requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each material listed in Table 148.10 of this part must be segregated from incompatible materials in accordance with—</P>
              <P>(1) The requirements of Tables 148.120A and 148.120B of this section that pertain to the primary or subsidiary hazard class to which the materials belong. Whenever a subsidiary hazard may exist, the most stringent segregation requirement applies; and</P>
              <P>(2) Any specific requirements in Subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) Materials that are required to be separated during stowage must not be handled at the same time. Any residue from a material must be removed before a material required to be separated from it is loaded.</P>
              <P>(c) Definitions and application of segregation terms:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">“Separated from”</E> means located in different cargo compartments or holds when stowed under deck. If the intervening deck is resistant to fire and liquid, a vertical separation, i.e., in different cargo compartments, is acceptable as equivalent to this segregation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">“Separated by a complete cargo compartment or hold from”</E> means either a vertical or horizontal separation, for example, by a complete cargo compartment or hold. If the intervening decks are not resistant to fire and liquid, only horizontal separation is acceptable.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">“Separated longitudinally by an intervening complete cargo compartment or hold from”</E> means that vertical separation alone does not meet this requirement.</P>

              <P>(a) The electrical equipment in cargo holds carrying coal must meet the requirements of Subpart 111.105 of this chapter or an equivalent standard approved by the administration of the vessel's flag state.</P>
              <P>(b) Before coal is loaded in a cargo hold, the bilges must be as clean and dry as practical. The hold must also be free of any readily combustible material, including the residue of previous cargoes if other than coal.</P>
              <P>(c) The master of each vessel carrying coal must ensure that—</P>

              <P>(1) All openings to the cargo hold, except for unloading gates on self-unloading vessels, are sealed before loading <PRTPAGE P="82"/>the coal and, unless the coal is as described in paragraph (f) of this section, the hatches must also be sealed after loading;</P>
              <P>(2) As far as practical, gases emitted by the coal do not accumulate in enclosed working spaces such as storerooms, shops, or passageways, and tunnel spaces on self-unloading vessels, and that such spaces are adequately ventilated;</P>
              <P>(3) The vessel has adequate ventilation as required by paragraph (f) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(4) If the temperature of the coal is to be monitored under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the vessel has instruments that are capable of measuring the temperature of the cargo in the range 0°-100 °C (32 °-212 °F) without entry into the cargo hold.</P>
              <P>(d) A cargo hold containing coal must not be ventilated unless the conditions of paragraph (f) of this section are met, or unless methane is detected under paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) If coal waiting to be loaded has shown a tendency to self-heat, has been handled so that it may likely self-heat, or has been observed to be heating, the master is responsible for monitoring the temperature of the coal at several intervals during these times:</P>
              <P>(1) Before loading; and</P>
              <P>(2) During the voyage, by—</P>
              <P>(i) Measuring the temperature of the coal;</P>
              <P>(ii) Measuring the emission of carbon monoxide; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Both.</P>
              <P>(f) If coal waiting to be loaded has a potential to emit dangerous amounts of methane, for example it is freshly mined, or has a history of emitting dangerous amounts of methane, then:</P>
              <P>(1) Surface ventilation, either natural or from fixed or portable nonsparking fans, must be provided; and</P>
              <P>(2) The atmosphere above the coal must be monitored for the presence of methane as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section. The results of this monitoring must be recorded at least twice in every 24-hour period, unless the conditions of paragraph (m) of this section are met.</P>
              <P>(g) Electrical equipment and cables in a hold containing a coal described in paragraph (f) of this section must be either suitable for use in an explosive gas atmosphere or de-energized at a point outside the hold. Electrical equipment and cables necessary for continuous safe operations, such as lighting fixtures, must be suitable for use in an explosive gas atmosphere. The master of the vessel must ensure that the affected equipment and cables remain de-energized as long as this coal remains in the hold.</P>
              <P>(h) For all coal loaded on a vessel, other than an unmanned barge, the atmosphere above the coal must be routinely tested for the presence of methane, carbon monoxide, and oxygen, following the procedures in the Appendices to the schedules for Coal and Brown Coal Briquettes as contained in the IMSBC Code (incorporated by reference, see § 148.8). This testing must be performed in such a way that the cargo hatches are not opened and entry into the hold is not necessary.</P>
              <P>(i) When carrying a coal described in paragraph (e) of this section, the atmosphere above the coal must be monitored for the presence of carbon monoxide as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section. The results of this monitoring must be recorded at least twice in every 24-hour period, unless the conditions of paragraph (m) of this section are met. If the level of carbon monoxide is increasing rapidly or reaches 20 percent of the lower flammability limit (LFL), the frequency of monitoring must be increased.</P>
              <P>(j) When a cargo of coal has a potential to self-heat or has been observed to be heating, the hatches should be closed and sealed and all surface ventilation halted except as necessary to remove any methane that may have accumulated.</P>
              <P>(k) If the level of carbon monoxide monitored under paragraph (i) of this section continues to increase rapidly or the temperature of coal carried on board a vessel exceeds 55 °C (131 °F) and is increasing rapidly, the master must notify the nearest Coast Guard Captain of the Port of—</P>
              <P>(1) The name, nationality, and position of the vessel;</P>

              <P>(2) The most recent temperature, if measured, and levels of carbon monoxide and methane;<PRTPAGE P="83"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The port where the coal was loaded and the destination of the coal;</P>
              <P>(4) The last port of call of the vessel and its next port of call; and</P>
              <P>(5) What action has been taken.</P>
              <P>(l) If the level of methane as monitored under paragraph (h) of this section reaches 20 percent of the LFL or is increasing rapidly, ventilation of the cargo hold, under paragraph (f) of this section, must be initiated. If this ventilation is provided by opening the cargo hatches, care must be taken to avoid generating sparks.</P>
              <P>(m) The frequency of monitoring required by paragraph (f) of this section may be reduced at the discretion of the master provided that—</P>
              <P>(1) The level of gas measured is less than 20 percent of the LFL;</P>
              <P>(2) The level of gas measured has remained steady or decreased over three consecutive readings, or has increased by less than 5 percent over four consecutive readings spanning at least 48 hours; and</P>
              <P>(3) Monitoring continues at intervals sufficient to determine that the level of gas remains within the parameters of paragraphs (m)(1) and (m)(2) of this section.</P>

              <E T="03">Definition of a hazardous reaction—</E> As a first approximation, a mixture of two cargoes is considered hazardous when, under specified condition, the temperature rise of the mixture exceeds 25 °C or a gas is evolved. It is possible for the reaction of two cargoes to produce a product that is significantly more flammable or toxic than the original cargoes even though the reaction is non-hazardous from temperature or pressure considerations, although no examples of such a reaction are known at this time.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Chart format—</E> There are different degrees of reactivity among the various cargoes. Many of them are relatively non-reactive: For example, aromatic hydrocarbons or paraffins. Others will form hazardous combinations with many groups: For example, the inorganic acids.</P>

            <P>The cargo groups in the compatibility chart are separated into two categories: 1 through 22 are “Reactive Groups” and 30 through 43 are “Cargo Groups”. Left unassigned and available for future expansion are groups 23 through 29 and those past 43. Reactive Groups contain products which are chemically the most reactive; dangerous combinations may result between members of different Reactive Groups and between members of Reactive Groups and Cargo Groups. Products assigned to Cargo Groups, however, are much less reactive; dangerous combinations involving these can be formed only with members of certain Reactive Groups. Cargo Groups do not react hazardously with one another.<PRTPAGE P="140"/>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Using the Compatibility Chart—</E> The following procedure explains how the compatibility chart should be used to find compatibility information:</P>
            <P>(1) Determine the group numbers of the two cargoes by referring to the alphabetical listing of cargoes and the corresponding groups (Table I). Many cargoes are listed under their parent names; unless otherwise indicated, isomers or mixtures of isomers of a particular cargo are assigned to the same group. For example, to find the group number for Isobutyl Alcohol, look under the parent name Butyl Alcohol. Similarly, the group number for para-Xylene is found under the entry Xylene. If a cargo cannot be found in this listing, contact the Coast Guard for a group determination (see § 150.140).</P>
            <P>(2) If both group numbers are between 30 and 43 inclusive, the products are compatible and the chart need not be used.</P>
            <P>(3) If both group numbers do not fall between 30 and 43 inclusive, locate one of the numbers on the left of the chart (Cargo Groups) and the other across the top (Reactive Groups). (Note that if a group number is between 30 and 43, it can only be found on the left side of the chart.) The box formed by the intersection of the column and row containing the two numbers will contain one of the following:</P>
            <P>(a) Blank—The two cargoes are compatible.</P>
            <P>(b) “X”—The two cargoes are not compatible.
            </P>
            <FP>(Note that reactivity may vary among the group members. Refer to Table I or Table II to find whether the products in question are referenced by a footnote which indicates that exceptions exist and are listed in Appendix I. Unless the combination is specifically mentioned in Appendix I, it is compatible.)</FP>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">experimental procedure for evaluating binary chemical reactivity</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">General safety precautions</E>—Chemical reactivity tests have, by their nature, serious potential for injuring the experimenter or destroying equipment. The experimenter should 1) have knowledge of the magnitude of the reactivity to be expected, 2) use adequate facilities and protective equipment to prevent injury from splatter of materials or release of fumes, and 3) start on a small scale so that unexpected reactions can be safely contained. All tests should be performed in a well-ventilated laboratory hood provided with shields.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Testing chemicals other than liquids</E>—The procedure outlined below was developed for chemicals which are liquids at ambient temperatures. If one or both chemicals are normally shipped at elevated temperatures, the same procedure may be followed except the chemicals are tested at their respective shipping temperatures and the oil bath in Step 3 is maintained at a level 25 °C above the higher temperature. This information is then indicated on the data sheet. If one of the chemicals is a gas at ambient temperatures, consult the Coast Guard for additional instructions before proceeding with the compatibility test.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Step 1</HD>
            <P>Objective—To determine if the test chemicals react violently and present a safety hazard in further tests.</P>
            <P>Procedure—Place 0.5ml of one (A) of the test chemicals in a 25 × 150mm test tube. Clamp the test tube to a stand behind a safety shield (in a hood). Carefully add from a dropper 0.5ml of the other substance (B). Shake to induce mixing. If no immediate reaction occurs, retain the mixture for at least 10 minutes to check for a delayed reaction.</P>
            <P>Results—If a violent reaction occurs, such as sputtering, boiling of reactants or release of fumes, record the results on the Data Sheet (appendix IV) and do not proceed to Step 2. If no reaction or a minor reaction occurs, proceed to Step 2.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Step 2</HD>
            <P>Objective—To determine the heat of reaction of two chemicals on mixing under specified conditions.</P>
            <P>Procedure—These separate mixes of the proposed binary combination will be tested. These are 2 ml : 18 ml, 10 ml : 10 ml, and 18 ml : 2 ml, respectively, to result in a final mixture of about 20 ml in each case.</P>

            <P>A reference-junctioned thermocouple is prepared by inserting two lengths of 20 gauge or finer iron-constantan or chromelalumel duplex thermocouple wire into glass capilary sheaths. The common wire of each probe is joined, while the other wire of each is connected to a strip-chart recorder. The thermocouple probe which produces a negative pen deflection upon warming is the reference junction and is placed in a test tube of water at ambient laboratory temperature. The other probe is placed near the bottom of a <PRTPAGE P="141"/>Dewar flask of about 300ml capacity, such that the thermocouple will be below the surface of the test mixture. The Dewar flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer having a stirring bar coated with an inert material such as a fluorinated hydrocarbon.</P>
            <P>Start the temperature recorder and stirrer. Deliver the test chemicals to the Dewar Flask simultaneously from separate graduated syringes. If an exothermic reaction occurs, continue the test until the maximum temperature is reached and begins to subside. If no apparent reaction occurs, continue the test for at least 30 minutes to check for a delayed reaction. Stop agitation and observe the mixture at five-minute intervals to determine if the mixture is miscible, if gases are evolved, or if other visible changes occur. In the interest of safety, a mirror can be used for these observations. Repeat the above test for the other mixture combinations.</P>
            <P>Results—Record the results in the appropriate places on the Data Sheet. If no reaction occurs or if the temperature rise is less than 25 °C, proceed to Step 3. If the observed temperature rise exceeds 25 °C or gases are evolved, do not proceed to Step 3.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Step 3</HD>
            <P>Objective—To determine if exothermic reactions occur at temperatures up to 50 °C.</P>
            <P>Procedure—If a non-hazardous reaction occurred in Step 2, the ratio of chemicals which resulted in the greatest temperature rise will be tested. Fresh chemicals will be used with a total volume for this test of about 10ml (a ratio of 1ml:9ml, 5ml:5ml, or 9ml:1ml). If no reaction was observed in Step 2, use a ratio of 5ml:5ml. Using the thermocouple prepared for Step 2, insert the reference probe into a 25 × 150mm test tube containing 10ml of water. Place the other probe into an empty test tube. Start the temperature recorder and add the two chemicals of the combination, one at a time, to the empty test tube. Lower the two test tubes into an oil bath maintained at 50 ±2 °C. Hold the samples in the oil bath until the maximum temperature differential is recorded, and in all cases at least 15 minutes. Observe the test mixture to determine if gases are evolved or if other visible changes occur. Follow prescribed safety precautions.</P>
            <P>Results—Record the maximum differential temperature measured, the time required to reach this temperature, and any other observations in the proper space on the Data Sheet.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Barge hull classifications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each barge constructed or converted in conformance with this subpart shall be assigned a hull type number.</P>
              <P>(1) Effective dates for certain requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) Barges constructed or converted between July 1, 1964, and June 1, 1970, in accordance with the construction requirements of §§ 32.63 and 98.03 of this chapter are considered to comply with the basic provisions of this subpart and will retain the hull type classification for the service for which they were originally approved. Changes in product endorsement will not be considered a change in service, except when a change to a product of higher specific gravity necessitates a reevaluation of the intact and damage stability requirements in subpart E of part 172 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(b) For this purpose the barge hull types shall be defined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Type I barge hull.</E> Barge hulls classed as Type I are those designed to carry products which require the maximum preventive measures to preclude the uncontrolled release of the cargo. These barges are required to meet:</P>
              <P>(i) Standards of intact stability and a modified two compartment standard of subdivision and damage stability, as specified in subpart E of part 172 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Hull structural requirements, including an assumed grounding condition.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Type I-S (special) barge hulls.</E> Type I-S (special) barge hulls are those constructed or converted for the carriage of chlorine in bulk prior to July 1, 1964, and modified to higher stability standards prior to July 1, 1968, but not meeting the requirements for full Type I classification.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Type II barge hull.</E> Barge hulls classed as Type II are those designed to carry products which require significant preventive measures to preclude the uncontrolled release of the cargo. These barges are required to meet:</P>
              <P>(i) Standards of intact stability and a modified one compartment standard of subdivision and damage stability, as specified in subpart E of part 172 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Hull structural requirements, including an assumed grounding condition.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Type III barge hull.</E> Barge hulls classed as Type III are those designed to carry products of sufficient hazard to require a moderate degree of control. These barges are required to meet:</P>
              <P>(i) Standards of intact stability as specified in subpart E of part 172 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Hull structural requirements.</P>

An integral tank is essential to the structural completeness of its vessel's hull.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Independent.</E> A cargo containment envelope which is not a contiguous part of the hull structure. An independent tank is built and installed so as to eliminate, wherever possible (or, in any event, to minimize) its stressing as a result of stressing or motion of the adjacent hull structure. In general, therefore, motion of parts of the tank relative to the adjacent hull structure is possible.

The insulation shall also meet the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Cargo tanks in which the temperature is maintained below the normal atmospheric temperature by refrigeration or other acceptable means shall be designed for a pressure of not less than 110 percent of the vapor pressure corresponding to the temperature of the liquid at which the system is maintained, or the pressure corresponding to the greatest dynamic and static loads expected to be encountered in service. For mechanically stressed relieved cargo tanks, additional factors relating design pressure and maximum allowable pressure shall be as specified by the Commandant. The material of the tank shall meet the material requirements specified in part 54 of this chapter for the service temperature, and this temperature shall be permanently marked on the tank as prescribed in § 54.10-20 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Venting.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This section contains definitions and requirements for the various methods of venting specified in Table 151.05. In addition to the requirement that all vents must penetrate into tanks at the top of the vapor space, the following methods of venting and the applicable restrictions are listed:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Open venting.</E> A venting system which offers no restriction (except pipe losses and flame screen, where used) to the movement of liquid or vapor to or from the cargo tank (via the vent) under normal operating conditions. The total cross-sectional area of the vents shall not be less than the total cross-sectional area of the filling pipe or pipes. Ullage openings may be counted as part of the required cross-sectional area: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That each cargo tank has at least one permanent vent. The minimum size of a cargo tank vent shall be not less than 2<FR>1/2</FR> inches. The outlet end of the vent shall terminate in a gooseneck bend and shall be located at a reasonable height above the weather deck, clear of all obstructions. No shut-off valve or frangible disk shall be fitted in the vent lines except that a float check valve may be installed so as to exclude the entry of water into the tank (i.e., to prevent downflooding). An open venting system may be fitted with a flame screen.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Pressure-vacuum venting.</E> A normally closed venting system fitted with a device to automatically limit the pressure or vacuum in the tank to design limits. Pressure-vacuum relief valves shall comply with the requirements of subpart 162.017 of this chapter. The required capacity of the venting system shall be in accordance with part 54 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Safety relief venting.</E> A closed venting system fitted with a device to automatically limit the pressure in the tank to below its maximum allowable working pressure. The maximum safety relief valve setting shall not exceed the maximum allowable working pressure of the tank. For cargoes carried at ambient temperatures, the minimum safety relief valve setting shall correspond to the saturated vapor pressure of the cargo at 105 °F if carried in an insulated tank, or 115 °F if carried in an uninsulated tank. For cargoes carried below ambient temperature, the safety relief valve setting shall be selected to provide a suitable margin between normal operating pressure of the tank and the opening pressure of the valve but in no case shall it exceed the maximum allowable working pressure of the tank. The safety relief valves shall be of a type approved under subparts 162.001 or 162.018 of subchapter Q of this chapter. The required capacity of the safety relief valves shall be in accordance with the requirements of part 54 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Rupture disks.</E> (1) When required by the nature of the cargo, rupture disks may be installed in lieu of or in addition to other pressure limiting devices in accordance with the requirements of § 54.15-13 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) When a pressure-vacuum relief valve or safety relief valve normally protected by a rupture disk or breaking pin device is exposed to the cargo due to breakage of the disk, the valve shall be reinspected before being returned to service.</P>

              <P>This section contains definitions and requirements for types of gauging devices specified in Table 151.05.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Open gauging.</E> A gauging method which uses an opening in the cargo tank and which may expose the gauge <PRTPAGE P="179"/>user to the cargo and its vapors. Examples of this type are gauge hatch, ullage hole.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Restricted.</E> A gauging device which penetrates the cargo tank and which, in operation, causes or permits the release to the atmosphere of small quantities of cargo vapor or liquid. The amount of cargo released is controlled by the small diameter of the tank penetration opening and by a locally operated valve or similar closure device in that opening. When not in use, this type gauging device is closed to maintain the complete integrity of cargo containment. Examples of this type are rotary tube, fixed tube, slip tube, sounding tube. (See §§ 151.03-49 and 151.15-10(g).)</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Closed.</E> A gauging device which penetrates the cargo tank, but which is part of a closed system maintaining the complete integrity of cargo containment. This device is designed and installed so as not to release cargo liquid or vapor in any amount to the atmosphere. Examples of this type are automatic float, continuous tape (magnetic coupled), sight glass (protected), electronic probe, magnetic, differential pressure cell.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Isolated or indirect.</E> A gauging method or device which is isolated from the tank (no penetration of the tank shell) and which may employ an indirect measurement to obtain the desired quantity. Examples of this type are weighing of cargo, sonic depth gauge (without penetration of tank shell), pipe flow meter.</P>
              <P>(e) All gauging devices and related fixtures which form a part of the cargo containment barrier shall be of suitable material and shall be designed for the pressure and temperature of the cargo in accordance with the requirements of Subchapter F of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Use of restricted gauging devices.</E> (1) When required in Table 151.05, cargoes carried under pressure shall have restricted gauging devices designed so that the maximum bleed valve opening is not larger than 0.055;inch; diameter, unless provided with an excess flow valve. Sounding tubes are prohibited for use with cargoes having a vapor pressure in excess of 14.7 p.s.i.a. at 115 °F, if carried in an uninsulated tank, or at 105 °F, if carried in an insulated tank.</P>
              <P>(2) When utilizing a sounding tube, the cargo tank vent system shall be designed to prevent the discharge of cargo through the sounding tube due to pressure build up in the cargo tank vapor space. (See § 151.03-43) When cargoes carried at atmospheric pressure are required to have a restricted gauging device, open gauges may be provided in addition to restricted gauges for this type of cargo. However, open gauges may not be used while cargo transfer operations are actually being performed.</P>
              <P>(g) Fixed tube gauges are not acceptable as primary means of gauging. They may be used as a check on the calibration of other gauging devices.</P>
              <P>(h) For pressure-vessel type tanks, each automatic float, continuous reading tape or similar type gauge not mounted directly on the tank or dome shall be fitted with a shutoff device located as close to the tank as practicable. When an automatic float gauging device, which gauges the entire height of the tank, is used, a fixed tube gauge set in the range of 85 percent to 90 percent of the water capacity of the tank shall be provided in addition as a means of checking the accuracy of the automatic float gauge, or other alternate means acceptable to the Commandant may be used.</P>
              <P>(i) Gauge glasses of the columnar type are prohibited.</P>
              <P>(j) Flat sight glasses may be used in the design of automatic float continuous reading tape gauges. However such glasses shall be made of high strength material, suitable for the operating temperatures, of not less than one-half inch in thickness and adequately protected by a metal cover.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Open hopper barges.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) All open hopper barges not constructed or modified in conformance with the provisions of Subpart 151.10 of this part when carrying in bulk any cargoes regulated by this subchapter shall meet the provisions of this section. However, the provisions of this section are not applicable to such barges when empty (not necessarily cleaned or gas-freed).</P>
              <P>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no such open hopper type barge shall be placed as lead barge in any tow. These barges shall be placed in protected positions within the tow so that the danger from diving or swamping will be minimized. Where, due to operating conditions, compliance with this paragraph is impossible, the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section apply. The person in charge of the towing vessel shall be responsible for compliance with this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(2) No such open hopper type barge shall be moved from a loading facility unless all void spaces and bilges are substantially free of water. Periodic inspections and necessary pumping shall be carried out to insure the maintenance of such water-free conditions, in order to minimize the free surface effect in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. Except when considered necessary for inspection or pumping, all hatch covers and other hull closure devices for void spaces and hull compartments shall be closed and secured at all times. In the case of unmanned barges, the person in charge of the towing vessel shall be deemed to be in charge of the barge, and all requirements to be carried out on the barge shall be carried out by or under the direction of this person.</P>
              <P>(3) When an open hopper type barge is in an exposed position, such that protection from swamping provided by adjoining barges cannot be obtained from the location within the tow, it shall be the responsibility of the person in charge of the towing vessel to control speed so as to insure protection against diving and swamping of the barge, having regard to its design and freeboard, and other operating conditions.</P>

              <P>(b) To show that special operating requirements apply to a specific open hopper type barge, additional placards or signs shall be displayed in at least four different locations on the barge when the cargoes subject to this part are carried in any form in the cargo tanks. The placards or signs shall be posted on the barge approximately amidships on each side and near the centerline fore and aft facing outboard. Racks, or other suitable means for mounting such placards or signs, shall be so arranged as to provide clear visibility and shall be protected from becoming readily damaged or obscured. The placards or signs shall be at least <PRTPAGE P="189"/>equal in dimensions to the DOT standard tank car “Dangerous” placard (10<FR>3/4</FR> inches square or larger) and shall display a circle (10 inches in diameter or larger) with alternating quadrants of white and red, and so mounted that the red quadrants are centered on the vertical axis. The shipper and/or owner of the barge shall be responsible for the installation of the required placards or signs, including maintenance of them while such barge is in temporary storage with cargo aboard. The person in charge of the towing vessel shall be responsible for the continued maintenance of the placards or signs while such barge is in transit.</P>

              <P>(a) Tanks carrying liquids or liquefied gases at ambient temperatures regulated by this subchapter shall be limited in the amount of cargo loaded to that which will avoid the tank being liquid full at 105 °F if insulated, or 115 °F if uninsulated. If specific filling densities are designated in Subpart 151.50 of this part, they shall take precedence over that noted above.</P>

              <P>(b) Refrigerated and semirefrigerated tanks shall be filled so that there is an outage of at least 2 percent of the volume of the tank at the temperature corresponding to the vapor pressure of the cargo at the safety relief valve setting. A reduction in the required outage may be permitted by the Commandant when warranted by special design considerations. Normally, then, the maximum volume to which a tank may be loaded is:

                <P>(3) The wash water must be heated if required by § 153.1108, and water or tank washings must pass through the cargo pump and piping, including any stripping equipment, during washing or during discharge of tank washings.<PRTPAGE P="259"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) The tank washing machine must be placed in all positions specified for the tank's Category A NLS prewash procedure in the approved Procedures and Arrangements Manual.</P>
                <P>(5) The tank must be pumped out each time there are enough tank washings collected in the bottom of the tank for the pump to gain suction, and if the NLS is immiscible with water or is a solidifying cargo, all floating and suspended NLS must be discharged.</P>
                <P>(6) The washing machine must be operated until samples of the discharged tank washings taken by the Surveyor are tested using the equipment required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section and the concentration of NLS is below 0.1 per cent by weight.</P>
                <P>(7) After the washing is stopped, the remaining tank washings must be pumped out.</P>
                <P>(8) The Cargo Record Book must have items 12 through 14 completed and must show the Surveyor's written certification of their accuracy.</P>
                <P>(9) The Cargo Record Book must have the Surveyor's written concurrence that the prewash procedures specified in the approved Procedures and Arrangements Manual were followed.</P>
                <P>(b) When this part requires a prewash of a tank containing Category B or C NLS residue or when the procedure in this paragraph is used as an alternative to the prewash procedure under paragraph (a) of this section, the prewash must meet the following:</P>
                <P>(1) If the prewash is for a Category A NLS, the prewash may not begin until a Surveyor is present.</P>
                <P>(2) The equipment specified in § 153.484 must be used as prescribed in the approved Procedures and Arrangements Manual for the prewash.</P>

                <P>(4) Except as required in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the number of washing machine cycles specified in Table 153.1120 must be completed. If a prewash is required by a section listed under Column 1 of Table 153.1120 and another section listed under Column 2, the number of cycles in Column 1 must be completed but no additional cycles are necessary.</P>
                <P>(5) If the approved Procedures and Arrangements Manual specifies that a tank washing machine must be moved for the prewash of a tank from which a Category A NLS or a solidifying NLS has been unloaded, the number of washing machine cycles specified in Table 153.1120 must be completed at each position to which the washing machine is moved.</P>
                <P>(6) When the NLS is immiscible with water or is a solidifying cargo, the tank must be pumped out each time enough tank washings collect in the bottom of the tank for the pump to gain suction, or the procedures in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) of this section must be repeated two additional times with the tank pumped out each time, for a total of three washings.</P>
                <P>(7) Items 12 through 14 in the Cargo Record Book must be completed and, if the prewash is for a Category A NLS, verification that the procedures specified in the approved Procedures and Arrangements Manual were followed shown by the Surveyor's endorsement in the Cargo Record Book.</P>

              <P>(5) Load the tank with enough water so that unloading the water simulates the final stages of unloading a full tank of cargo.</P>
              <P>(6) Pump out the water and strip the tank using the procedures specified in the approved Procedures and Arrangements Manual.</P>
              <P>(7) After shutting the manifold valve, open any cargo pump foot valve to allow water trapped in the cargo pump to drain into the tank.</P>
              <P>(8) Open all valves in the piping system except the manifold valve and allow the water to drain into the tank.</P>
              <P>(9) Squeegee or sweep the water drained under paragraphs (b)(7) and (b)(8) of this section and any water that stands in puddles on the tank floor to the tank's low point or sump and collect in the container required by § 153.1600(b) using the equipment required in § 153.1600(e).</P>
              <P>(10) With the manifold valve still closed, drain any water remaining in the piping system on the ship's side of the cargo transfer manifold valve into containers, and add this water to that collected from the tank under paragraph (b)(9) of this section. Water collected from a cargo line serving a block of tanks may be prorated between all the tanks it serves if—</P>

              <P>(i) The ship owner requests, under the provisions of § 153.10, that the water be prorated; and<PRTPAGE P="263"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The ship's approved Procedures and Arrangements Manual specifies that no tank in the block be washed until all the tanks in the block have been discharged.</P>
              <P>(c) Include any water that is trapped in dead end pipe sections, either by—</P>
              <P>(1) Draining the pipe sections and adding the water to that collected in the container under paragraphs (b)(9) and (b)(10) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(2) Adding an estimate of the water's volume to the sum calculated in paragraph (d) of this section using the pipe's dimensions, the ship's list and trim, and the geometry of the piping system.</P>
              <P>(d) Measure the volume of water collected in the container under paragraphs (b)(9), (b)(10), and (c)(1) of this section and add to that volume the volume, if any, estimated under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
