      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2017), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(2) Is engaged on a voyage—</P>
              <P>(i) From a country to which the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, (SOLAS 74) applies, to a port outside that country or the reverse;</P>
              <P>(ii) From any territory, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, all possessions of the United States and all lands held by the United States under a protectorate or mandate, whose international relations are the responsibility of a contracting SOLAS 74 government, or which is administered by the United Nations, to a port outside that territory or the reverse; or</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicability to vessels operating under an exemption afforded in the Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 (PVSA).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 (PVSA) contained an allowance for the exemption of certain passenger vessels that are—</P>
              <P>(1) At least 100 gross tons but less than 300 gross tons; or</P>
              <P>(2) Former public vessels of at least 100 gross tons but less than 500 gross tons.</P>
              <P>(b) The owner or operator of a vessel must have applied for an exemption under the PVSA by June 21, 1994, and then brought the vessel into compliance with the interim guidance in Navigation and Inspection Circular (NVIC) 7-94 not later than December 21, 1996. The PVSA exemption is valid for the service life of the vessel, as long as the vessel remains certified for passenger service. If the Certificate of Inspection (COI) is surrendered or otherwise becomes invalid (not including a term while the vessel is out of service but undergoing an inspection for recertification), the owner or operator must meet the appropriate inspection regulations to obtain a new COI without the PVSA exemption. See 46 CFR 175.118 for information about applicable regulations for vessels that operate under the PVSA exemption.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Gross tonnage as a criterion for requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The regulations in this subchapter, as well as referenced requirements in other subchapters in this chapter, take into account the passenger vessel's size, construction, and equipment, as well as its intended service on the routes or waters on which it is desired to be operated or navigated, which are indications of the hazards to which such vessel may be subjected. The Commandant's determinations in this respect for a particular passenger vessel are stipulated in a certificate of inspection, which states certain terms and conditions governing such vessel when in operation.</P>
              <P>(b) In applying the laws and regulations to passenger vessels, one criterion for invocation of safety standards is the description of passenger vessels by relative size in gross tons. When it is determined by the Commandant that the gross register tonnage for a particular passenger vessel, which is attained by exemptions, reductions, or other devices in the basic gross tonnage formulation, will circumvent or be incompatible with the application of specific safety requirements in the passenger vessel regulations for a vessel of such physical size, the Commandant shall prescribe the regulations to be made applicable to such vessel.</P>
              <P>(c) When the Commandant determines that the gross register tonnage is not a valid criterion for the invocation of safety requirements based on relative size, the parties involved will be informed of the determination and of the regulations applicable to such passenger vessel, and before being permitted to operate such vessel, compliance therewith shall be required. Endorsements or notations on the passenger vessel's certificate of inspection may be made as appropriate.</P>

              <P>The Alternative Hull Examination (AHE) Program provides you with an alternative to a drydock examination by allowing your vessel's hull to be examined while it remains afloat. If completed using only divers, this program has four steps: the application process, the preliminary examination, the pre-survey meeting, and the hull examination. If the vessel is already participating in the program or if a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) is used during the program, the preliminary exam step may be omitted. Once you complete these steps, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI), will evaluate the results and accept the examination as a credit hull exam if the vessel is in satisfactory condition. If only divers are used for the underwater survey portion of the examination process, you may receive credit for a period of time such that subsequent AHEs would be conducted at intervals of twice in every five years, with no more than three years between any two AHEs. The OCMI may waive an underwater survey in accordance with § 71.50-29(d) provided that the interval does not exceed five years between any two underwater surveys. If an underwater ROV is used as the predominate method to examine the vessel's underwater hull plating, you may receive credit up to five years. At the end of this period, you may apply for further participation under the AHE Program.

              <SUBJECT>Continued participation in the Alternative Hull Examination (AHE) program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To continue to participate in the AHE Program, vessel operators must conduct an annual hull condition assessment. At a minimum, vessel operators must conduct an internal examination and take random hull gaugings internally during the hull condition assessment, unless waived by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI). If the annual hull assessment reveals significant damage or corrosion, where temporary repairs have been made, or where other critical areas of concern have been identified, the OCMI may require an expanded examination to include an underwater hull examination using divers. If an underwater examination is required, the examination must focus on areas at higher risk of damage or corrosion and must include a representative sampling of hull gaugings.</P>
              <P>(b) If an underwater survey is required for the annual hull condition assessment, the OCMI may require the presence of a third party examiner and a written hull examination report must be submitted to the OCMI. This report must include thickness gauging results, a copy of the audio and video recordings and any other information that will help the OCMI evaluate your vessel for continued participation in the AHE program. The third party examiner must sign the report and confirm the validity of its contents.</P>
              <P>(c) You must submit your preventive maintenance reports or checklists on an annual basis to the OCMI. These reports or checklists must conform to the plans you submitted in your application under § 71.50-19 of this part, which the OCMI approved.</P>
              <P>(d) Prior to each scheduled annual hull condition assessment—</P>
              <P>(1) The owner may submit to the OCMI a plan for conducting the assessment, or a request for a waiver of this requirement, no fewer than 30 days before the scheduled assessment; and</P>
              <P>(2) The OCMI may reduce the scope or extend the interval of the assessment if the operational, casualty, and deficiency history of the vessel, along with a recommendation of the vessel's master, indicates that it is warranted.</P>

              <P>(1) Each watertight subdivision bulkhead, whether transverse or longitudinal, shall be constructed in such a manner that it shall be capable of supporting, with a proper margin of resistance, the pressure due to the maximum head of water which it might have to sustain in the event of damage to the vessel, but at least the pressure due to a head of water up to the margin line. The construction of the bulkheads shall be to the satisfaction of the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(2) Steps and recesses in subdivision bulkheads shall be watertight and as strong as the bulkhead at the place where each occurs. Decks, trunks, tunnels, duct keels, ventilators, etc., that are made watertight to maintain the subdivision requirements for a vessel shall be of the same strength as the bulkhead at the corresponding levels. The means used for making them watertight and the arrangements adopted for closing openings in them shall be to the satisfaction of the Commandant. Watertight ventilators and trunks shall be carried at least up to the bulkhead deck.</P>
              <P>(3) Where frames or beams pass through a watertight bulkhead or deck, such bulkhead or deck shall be made structurally watertight without the use of wood, cement, or similar materials.</P>
              <P>(4) Subdivision bulkheads, including steps, recesses, trunks, tunnels, ventilators, etc., which might form part of such bulkheads, shall be thoroughly examined and hose tested upon completion of construction.

However, draft stops meeting at least Class B-0 requirements shall be fitted not more than 45 feet apart between the ceiling or lining and the deck or shell. The space behind the linings of stairways and similar trunks shall have similar draft stops at each deck.</P>
              <P>(i) Where Class B-15 bulkhead panels are required to go beyond the ceiling to the deck above, or beyond the lining to the shell, the portion of the bulkhead panel within the void space need only meet B-0 requirements.</P>
              <P>(j) Where “B” Class panels are used, all four edges of the panel shall be retained by continuous steel or equivalent metal flanges on both sides of the panel offering at least <FR>3/4</FR> inch coverage. The top and bottom flanges shall be so attached to the structural decks above and below so as to support and restrain the panels in the event of fire. Other methods of construction may be specifically approved by the Commandant if determined to be equivalent.</P>
              <P>(k) Any sheathing, furring, or holding pieces incidental to the securing of structural insulation shall be of approved incombustible materials.</P>
              <P>(l) Where linings or bulkhead panels are framed away from the shell or structural bulkheads, the deck within the void space so formed need only meet Class A-0 requirements.</P>
              <P>(m) Decks within accommodation spaces and inside safety areas may have an overlay for leveling or finishing purposes which need not meet the requirements for an approved deck covering. Such an overlay will not be considered as giving any insulating value and may not in general exceed <FR>3/8</FR> of an inch in thickness. Greater thicknesses may be specifically approved by the Commandant for specific locations.</P>
              <P>(n) Rugs and carpets may be used in addition to any deck covering or overlay installed. Rugs and carpets used in stairways or corridors shall be of wool, or other materials having equivalent fire-resistive qualities.</P>
              <P>(o) Decking within surgical operating rooms shall be of a type which is acceptably conductive to prevent accumulation of dangerous electrostatic charges, and shall be in general agreement with “Code for Flammable Anesthetics” of issue in effect at the time the construction or alteration of the vessel is contracted for, published by the National Fire Protection Association, 1 Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02269.</P>
              <P>(p) Decks in washrooms and toilet spaces, service, cargo, and machinery spaces, open decks, exterior safety areas, and enclosed promenades may have an overlay in any thickness. This overlay need not meet the requirements for an approved deck covering.</P>

Where such ceilings or linings are given credit for their insulating value in obtaining a bulkhead or deck classification they shall be of Class B-15 bulkhead panel material, and the construction shall be as required by § 72.05-10(j).</P>
              <P>(b) Bulkheads, linings, and ceilings may have a combustible veneer within a room not to exceed <FR>2/28</FR> of an inch in thickness. However, combustible veneers shall not be used in passageways or stairway enclosures, or in spaces specifically restricted by tables 72.05-10 (d) through (g).</P>

Such trim, molding, or decorations shall not perform any structural function, and shall not be used in corridors or stairway enclosures.</P>

              <P>(d) Combustible veneers, trim, decorations, etc., shall not be used in or extend into hidden spaces such as behind <PRTPAGE P="42"/>linings or ceilings or in the matter of double bulkheads.</P>
              <P>(e) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as prohibiting the covering of any surface with a reasonable number of coats of paint or with a Marine Finish meeting the requirements of subpart 164.012 of subchapter Q (Specifications) of this chapter. This includes corridors, stairway enclosures, and hidden spaces.</P>
              <P>(f) Partial bulkheads or decks used to subdivide a space for artistic treatment, privacy, etc., shall meet the requirements of Class C bulkheads.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Except as further noted the provisions of this section apply to all vessels.</P>
              <P>(2) For small vessels, special consideration for relief may be given where it is shown to be unreasonable or impracticable to meet the detailed requirements for stairway size, slope, dimensioning, and landing area.</P>
              <P>(3) Stairways, ladders, and elevators within main machinery spaces or cargo holds are not covered by the general provisions of this section, but shall meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Stairways, ladders, and elevators within main machinery spaces and cargo holds shall meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) All stairways, ladders, and elevators shall be of steel.</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(c) Deck penetrations shall meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Where a continuous vertical deck penetration for a stairway or elevator exceeds one deck, the integrity of all decks involved shall be assured by enclosure bulkheads and decks meeting the applicable requirements of § 72.05-10 (d) through (g), and by doors at all levels meeting the requirements of § 72.05-25(b)(9).</P>
              <P>(2) Where only two decks are served by a stairway or elevator, the integrity of the deck involved may be assured as noted in the preceding paragraph. Alternately, the integrity may be maintained at one level only by means of bulkheads and by doors meeting the requirements of § 72.05-25(b)(9). If the latter method is used, it should be noted that the integrity of a deck is involved, and accordingly, the bulkhead classifications should be selected from tables 72.05-10(f) or 72.05-10(g), the spaces above or below being assumed to extend to the bulkheads and doors.</P>
              <P>(3) Stairways or elevators to a balcony within a space need not be enclosed, provided the stairway or elevator serves only the space and the balcony within the space.</P>

              <P>(d) For the purpose of this section, stairways are identified as follows:

              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(e) Each Main Vertical Zone shall be served by at least one Type 1 stairway, so that independent of adjoining Main Vertical Zones, escape may be effected from any accommodation space or any other space where persons may be normally quartered or employed, to ALL other decks having any such spaces within the same Main Vertical Zone without coming out of the stair tower enclosure. Each Type 1 stairway shall give access to the Embarkation Deck or, if the Embarkation Deck does not extend to the portion of the vessel in question, to at least one weather deck from which convenient communication to the Embarkation Deck is provided by means of Type 4 stairways. In cases where a Type 1 stairway is accessible from two Main Vertical Zones, it may be considered as the required Type 1 stairway for both zones provided all boundaries of the stairway meet Main Vertical Zone requirements.</P>
              <P>(f) Insofar as is reasonable and practicable, Types 1 and 2 stairways, and all elevator enclosures, should not give direct access to accommodations or other enclosed spaces in which a fire may originate.</P>
              <P>(g) The furnishings for Types 1 and 2 stairways, and all elevator enclosures, shall be as set forth in § 72.05-55(c).</P>

              <P>(h) In general, curved, spiral, or winding stairways will not be permitted. Relaxation from this requirement may be permitted, provided, in the opinion of the Commandant, the <PRTPAGE P="43"/>proposed stairway is equivalent with respect to safety and dimensions to the stairways covered by this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For all types of stairways, the stairs, platforms, and landings shall be of sufficient strength to sustain a load of 100 pounds per square foot with a factor of safety of 4 based on the ultimate strength.</P>
              <P>(j) The stringers, treads, and all platforms and landings of all Types 1, 2, and 3 stairways shall be of solid steel construction. Risers shall be of approved incombustible material.</P>
              <P>(k) For all types of stairways, handrails shall be fitted on both sides of the stairs. For stairways in excess of 66 inches in width, additional center handrails shall be provided. All handrails shall be fitted at a vertical height above the tread at its nosing of between 33 and 36 inches.</P>
              <P>(l) For all types of stairways, the stair width shall be clear of all obstructions other than the handrails.</P>
              <P>(m) Handrails and trim for all Types 1, 2, and 3 stairways shall be of approved “incombustible materials.”</P>
              <P>(n) For all types of stairways, there shall be no variation in the width of the stairs, the depth of the tread, or the height of the risers in any flight. Where variation in height of riser or depth of tread in different flights is necessary, such variations shall be minimized.</P>
              <P>(o) For all types of stairways, the sum of the riser height and tread depth shall be at least 17 inches and not more than 18 inches. Types 1, 2, and 3 stairways having treads less than 10 inches in depth shall have a nosing of one inch or other means to provide additional room on the tread.</P>
              <P>(p) All stairways shall be dimensioned in accordance with table 72.05-20(p), depending upon the type of stairway and the number of persons served.</P>

              <P>(2) For all types of stairways, the minimum width shall be determined on a deck-by-deck basis. Except as further noted, on any particular deck, only those persons on that deck using the stairway are involved in the width determination. However, once a minimum required width has been established at any one level, that width may not be reduced at any subsequent deck level in the direction of normal escape. This does not prohibit the use of stair widths exceeding the required minimum for any particular flight or flights.</P>
              <P>(3) The various spaces shall be considered to have the number of persons in them as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Passenger staterooms—designed capacity.</P>
              <P>(ii) Crew staterooms—two-thirds designed capacity.</P>

              <P>(v) Working spaces—normal operating capacity.</P>

              <P>(4) Type 1 stairways shall be dimensioned on a deck-by-deck basis as described in the previous subparagraphs. In determining the number of persons using a Type 1 stairway, all persons within the Main Vertical Zone or Zones <PRTPAGE P="44"/>in question are assumed to be using Type 1 stairways. No consideration is given to any Type 2 or 3 stairways that may be available. If more than one Type 1 stairway serves a particular Main Vertical Zone, the persons shall be distributed between the stairways dependent upon the arrangements, and the stairways shall be dimensioned accordingly. If in the normal operation of the vessel, a Type 1 stairway is intended for a greater number of persons than given by the foregoing, the larger number shall be used.</P>
              <P>(5) Types 2, 3, and 4 stairways shall be dimensioned on a deck-by-deck basis as described in this paragraph. In determining the number of persons using the stairways, the normal operation of the vessel shall be the determining factor. In this respect, if any particular stairway forms part of a normal debarkation route, the number of persons using the stairway for that purpose shall be considered.</P>
              <P>(q) All types of stairways designed with a broken flight between any two decks shall conform to the additional requirements of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(1) Any interruption of the slope or change of direction of the stairway shall be accomplished by means of an intermediate landing of rectangular or nearly rectangular shape based on the actual dimensions of the stairs landing thereon.</P>
              <P>(2) Each set of stairs of a broken flight shall be dimensioned independently, and shall conform to the minimum stair widths given in table 72.05-20(p).</P>
              <P>(r) Landings for stairways shall be provided in accordance with the applicable requirements of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(1) For all types of stairways, at the top and bottom of each flight of stairs, there shall be a clear landing having an area at least equal to the square of the actual stair tread width.</P>
              <P>(2) For Type 1 stairways, there shall be provided within the enclosure at each deck level a landing having a minimum clear area in square feet, exclusive of the stairs, equal to 1.2 times the number of persons from that deck using the stairway.</P>
              <P>(3) Where an aisle around a stairway is required due to the relationship of the flights, such aisle shall have a clear width at all points at least equal to the actual stair tread width.</P>
              <P>(s) The total clear width of doors to stairways shall be as set forth in table 72.05-20(s), and shall meet all of the other applicable requirements of this paragraph.</P>

              <P>(b) Vessels on an international voyage shall have a minimum total fire pump capacity at least equal to two-thirds of the required total bilge pump capacity, but in no case less than that required by this section. Each of the required fire pumps shall have a capacity not less than 80 percent of the total required capacity divided by the number of required pumps.</P>
              <P>(c) Each pump shall be capable of delivering water simultaneously from the two highest outlets at a Pitot tube pressure of approximately 50 p. s. i. Where one or both of these outlets is a 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch siamese fitting, both branches of the siamese fitting at each such outlet shall be utilized for the purpose of this requirements.</P>
              <P>(d) Fire pumps shall be fitted on the discharge side with relief valves set to relieve at 25 p. s. i. in excess of the pressure necessary to maintain the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section or 125 p. s. i., whichever is greater. Relief valves may be omitted if the pumps, operating under shutoff conditions, are not capable of developing a pressure exceeding this amount.</P>
              <P>(e) Fire pumps shall be fitted with a pressure gauge on the discharge side of the pumps.</P>

              <P>(f) Fire pumps may be used for other purposes provided at least one of the required pumps is kept available for use on the fire system at all times. In no case shall a pump having connection to an oil line be used as a fire pump. Branch lines connected to the fire main for purposes other than fire and deck wash shall be arranged so that the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of <PRTPAGE P="61"/>this section and any other services installed on the fire main can be met simultaneously.</P>
              <P>(g) The total area of the pipes leading from a pump shall not be less than the discharge area of the pump.</P>
              <P>(h) If a vessel uses main or auxiliary oil fired boilers or internal combustion propulsion machinery, and is required to have two fire pumps, the pumps must be in separate spaces and the arrangement of pumps, sea connections, and sources of power must be arranged to ensure that a fire in any one space will not put all of the fire pumps out of operation. However, in vessels of less than 300 feet in length, when it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that it is unreasonable or impracticable to meet this requirement due to the size or arrangement of the vessel, or for other reasons, the installation of a total flooding carbon dioxide or clean agent extinguishing system may be accepted as an alternate method of extinguishing any fire that affects the powering and operation of at least one of the required fire pumps.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fire station hydrants, hose and nozzles</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The size of fire hydrants, hoses, and nozzles, and the length of hose required, must be as specified in Table 76.10-5(a) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) On vessels of more than 1,500 gross tons, the 2<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose and hydrants specified in Table 76.10-5(a) may be replaced with 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose and hydrants as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The hydrants in interior locations may have wye connections for 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose. In these cases, the hose must be 75 feet (22.86 meters) in length, and only one hose will be required at each fire station; however, if every interior space can be reached by a 50-foot hose then 50-foot hoses may be installed at each interior fire hydrant; and</P>
              <P>(2) The hydrants for external locations may consist of two 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch outlets, each with a 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose, supplied through a wye connection as a substitute.</P>
              <P>(c) On vessels of 500 gross tons or more, there must be at least one shore connection to the fire main available to each side of the vessel in an accessible location. Suitable cut-out valves and check valves must be provided. Suitable adaptors also must be provided for furnishing the vessel's shore connections with couplings mating those on the shoreside fire lines. Vessels of 500 gross tons or more on an international voyage must be provided with at least one international shore connection complying with ASTM F 1121 (incorporated by reference, see § 76.01-2). Facilities must be available that enable an international shore connection to be used on either side of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(d) Fire hydrants must be of sufficient number and so located that any part of the vessel accessible to the passengers or crew while the vessel is being navigated, other than main machinery spaces and cargo holds, may be reached with at least two streams of water from separate outlets, at least one of which must be from a single length of hose. All areas of the main machinery spaces and cargo holds must be capable of being reached by at least two streams of water, each of which must be from a single length of hose from separate outlets. This requirement need not apply to shaft alleys containing no assigned space for the stowage of combustibles. Fire hydrants must be numbered as required by § 78.47-20 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(e) All parts of the fire main located on exposed decks must either be protected against freezing or be fitted with cut-out valves and drain valves so that the entire exposed parts of such piping may be shut off and drained in freezing weather. Except when closed to prevent freezing, such valves must be sealed open.</P>

              <P>(f) The outlet at each fire hydrant must be provided with a cock or valve fitted in such a position that the firehose may be removed while the fire main is under pressure. In addition, the outlet must be limited to any position from the horizontal to the vertical pointing downward, so that the hose will lead horizontally or downward to minimize the possibility of kinking.<PRTPAGE P="62"/>
              </P>
              <P>(g) Each fire hydrant must have at least one length of firehose, a spanner wrench, and a hose rack or other device for stowing the hose.</P>
              <P>(h) Firehoses must be connected to the outlets at all times. However, on open decks where no protection is afforded to the hose in heavy weather, or where the hose may be liable to damage from the handling of cargo, the hose may be temporarily removed from the hydrant and stowed in an accessible nearby location.</P>
              <P>(i) A firehose must not be used for any purpose other than fire extinguishing and fire drills.</P>
              <P>(j) Each firehose on each hydrant must have a combination solid stream and water spray firehose nozzle that meets the requirements in 46 CFR 162.027. Firehose nozzles previously approved under subpart 162.027 of this chapter may be retained so long as they are maintained in good condition to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.</P>
              <P>(k) Straight stream firehose nozzles approved under 46 CFR 162.027 must have low-velocity water spray applicators for—</P>
              <P>(1) Two firehoses within the accommodation and service areas; and</P>
              <P>(2) Each firehose within propulsion machinery spaces containing an oil-fired boiler, internal combustion machinery, or an oil fuel unit on a vessel on an international voyage or on any vessel of 1,000 gross tons or more. The length of each applicator must be not more than 1.8 meters (6 feet).</P>
              <P>(l) Fixed brackets, hooks, or other means for stowing an applicator must be next to each fire hydrant that has an applicator under paragraph (k) of this section.</P>
              <P>(m) Fire hydrants, nozzles, and other fittings must have threads to accommodate the hose connections noted in paragraph (l) of this section.</P>
              <P>(n) Firehose and couplings must be as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Fire station hydrant connections must be brass, bronze, or other equivalent metal. Couplings must either—</P>

              <P>(i) Use National Standard (NS) firehose coupling threads for the 1<FR>1/2</FR>-in (38-mm) and 2<FR>1/2</FR>-in (64-mm) hose sizes, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> 9 threads per inch for a 1<FR>1/2</FR>-in hose, and 7<FR>1/2</FR> threads per inch for a 2<FR>1/2</FR>-in hose; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Be a uniform design for each hose diameter throughout the vessel.</P>
              <P>(2) Each section of firehose must be a lined commercial firehose that conforms to UL 19 (incorporated by reference, see § 76.01-2). A hose that bears the label of UL as a lined firehose is accepted as conforming to this requirement.</P>

              <P>(3) The fire detection zone must not include spaces on more than one deck, except:</P>
              <P>(i) Adjacent and communicating spaces on different decks at the ends of the vessel having a combined ceiling area of not more than 3,000 sq ft;</P>
              <P>(ii) Isolated rooms or lockers in such spaces as mast houses, wheelhouse top, etc., which are easily communicable with the area of the fire detection circuit to which they are connected; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Systems with indicators for individual spaces.</P>
              <P>(4) The fire detection zone must not contain more than 50 protected rooms or spaces.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Repair of existing systems.</E> (1) If the status of the approval for the system is other than “Former—Do not use”, the system may be repaired by the following means:</P>
              <P>(i) Repair in kind using the same components as installed and listed on the approved drawings;</P>
              <P>(ii) Repair using equivalent components from the authorized component list for the type approval for that system;</P>
              <P>(iii) Repair using equivalent components from the authorized component list for the type approval for another fire detection system, provided that the replacement devices are compatible with the installed system; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Repair using devices that are currently type approved, provided that the replacement devices are compatible with the installed system.</P>
              <P>(2) Any changes to the system that will result in the fire detection system not complying with the approved drawings require the drawings to be revised and submitted to the Marine Safety Center for review.</P>

              <P>(a) The system must be so arranged and installed that the presence of smoke in any of the protected spaces will automatically be indicated visually to an observer directly in front of the detection cabinet. The visible notice must automatically indicate the zone in which the smoke originated. The detection cabinet must normally be located in the pilothouse or fire control station. On vessels greater than 5,000 gross tons, there must also be an automatic audible alarm in the wheelhouse together with an auxiliary audible alarm in the engine room.</P>

              <P>(b) If the detection cabinet is not located in the pilothouse or fire control station, it must be located in convenient proximity to the valve control station of the extinguishing system. In this case, there must be in the pilothouse or fire control station automatic visual alarms, one for each zone in which an alarm may originate, as well as an automatic audible alarm. There must also be an auxiliary audible alarm in the engine room. For installations contracted for on or after January 1, 1962, where detection cabinets are not located in the pilothouse or an adjacent fire control station having direct access to the pilothouse, an efficient means of direct communication <PRTPAGE P="82"/>must be provided between the pilothouse and the stations where the detection cabinets are located.</P>
              <P>(c) No exhaust from the detection cabinet may be discharged in the vicinity of the cabinet to permit the detection of fire by odor. Instead, the exhaust must be directed to the outside. Vessels must comply with this requirement not later than July 22, 2021.</P>
              <P>(d) The smoke detection system must be used for no other purpose except that it may be incorporated with the fire extinguishing system to the spaces covered by the smoke detection system.</P>
              <P>(e) The accumulators, detection cabinet, interconnecting valves with the fire extinguishing system, alarms, and indicating devices must be of an approved type.</P>
