      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.

        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

              § 2.10-105
              Prepayment of annual vessel inspection fees.
              (a) Vessel owners may prepay the annual vessel inspection fee for any period of not less than three years, and not more than the design life or remaining expected service life of the vessel.
              (b) To prepay the annual vessel inspection fee for a period of three or more years, the owner must submit a written request to Commandant (CG-DCO-83) specifying the vessel identification number and the period for which prepayment is to be made.
              (c) The total of the annual fees for the requested prepayment period will be discounted to its net present value using the following formula:
              
                ER13MR95.000
              
              
                Where:
                
                PV is the Present Value of the series of annual user fees to be prepaid (the net amount to be prepaid)
                RO is the published user fee of the vessel
                i is the interest rate for 10-year Treasury notes at the time of prepayment calculation
                π is the rate of inflation (based on projected military personnel costs at the time of prepayment calculation)

                n is the total number of years to be prepaid
                
                t is the number of years after prepayment of the fee, for each annual increment (t = 0, 1, 2, 3 ... n)
              
              
              (d) When the annual vessel inspection fee has been prepaid, the entitlement to inspection services for the prepayment period attaches to the vessel and remains with the vessel if it is sold. The entitlement to inspection services may not be transferred to any other vessel.
              (e) If a vessel is removed from Coast Guard certification and the vessel owner surrenders the vessel's Certificate of Inspection, the owner may request a refund of the remaining prepayment amount. The annual vessel inspection fee will not be refunded for the year in which the Certificate of Inspection is surrendered. The request for refund must be submitted to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection to whom the Certificate of Inspection is surrendered. The Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection will endorse and forward the request to Commandant (CG-DCO-83) for decision.

              § 2.10-115
              Changes in vessel service.
              (a) If a vessel certificated for a single service, changes service, the annual vessel inspection fee is not adjusted during the year in which a change in service occurs. The annual vessel inspection fee for the new vessel category is payable on the vessel's user fee anniversary date immediately following the date of the change in service.
              (b) If a change in service occurs and the annual vessel inspection fee has been prepaid, Commandant (CG-DCO-83) will recalculate the prepayment amount based on the new vessel category and advise the owner of available prepayment options.

            Subpart 2.75—Approvals of Safety Equipment, Materials and Installations, and Qualifications for Construction Personnel
            
              § 2.75-1
              Approvals.
              (a) Certain navigation and vessel inspection laws, or regulations in this chapter or in 33 CFR chapter I, require the Commandant's approval before specific types of safety equipment, materials, or installations may be installed or used on vessels subject to Coast Guard inspection, or on other described vessels, motorboats, artificial islands, and fixed structures.
              (b) The Commandant's approvals are issued to persons, partnerships, companies, or corporations who offer for sale specific items of safety equipment, materials, or installations, or intend them for their own or others' use. These approvals are intended to provide a control over the quality of such approved items. The Commandant's approvals apply only to those items constructed or installed in accordance with applicable requirements, and the details as described in the documents granting specific approval. If a specific item when manufactured does not comply with these details, then it is not considered to be approved and the approval issued does not apply to such modified item. For example, if an item is manufactured with changes in design or material not previously approved, the approval does not apply to such modified item. The failure to comply with applicable requirements and details specified in the approval subjects the holder to immediate suspension of approval as described in § 2.75-40, and if necessary, to a public hearing seeking withdrawal of approval and removal of all such items from use or installation as provided in § 2.75-50.

              (c) The Commandant's approvals are issued to qualified holders in the form of certificates of approval (Form CGHQ-10030), by appropriate description and identification in documents filed with the Office of the Federal Register and published in the Federal Register, or by letters, or by appropriate markings on drawings, plans, etc. Under the direction of the Commandant, the Deputy for Operations Policy and Capabilities (CG-DCO-D) is delegated the authority to exercise the necessary actions relating to the granting, suspension, cancellation or revocation of approvals for special items of safety equipment, materials or installations required by law in regulation in this chapter or in 33 CFR chapter I to have the Commandant's approval. The authority delegated to the Deputy for Operations Policy and Capabilities (CG-DCO-D) may be further delegated by him.

              (d) The approvals granted to holders qualifying under the regulations in this chapter or in specifications, copies of which may be obtained from the Commandant (CG-ENG), and to which official Coast Guard numbers are assigned, will be in the form of certificates of approval. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the approval shall be valid for a period of five years from the date on the certificate of approval, but subject to suspension and/or cancellation if it is found the item offered, sold, or used as Coast Guard approved differs in any detail from the item as described in the certificate of approval and referenced material.
              (e) A specific Commandant's approval granted to anyone, which is described in a certificate of approval, or a letter, or marked plans, etc., cannot be transferred to another without a specific prior authorization from the Commandant. Such a transfer without the Commandant's authorization normally terminates such approval.

              (f) A listing of current and formerly approved equipment and materials may be found on the internet at: http://cgmix.uscg.mil/equipment. Each OCMI may be contacted for information concerning approved equipment.

              (1) Required by law or regulation; or
              (2) Required by an employer as a condition for employment.
              (b) A person is considered to be acting under the authority of the credential or endorsement while engaged in official matters regarding the credential or endorsement. This includes, but is not limited to, such acts as applying for renewal, taking examinations for raises of grade, requesting duplicate or replacement credentials, or when appearing at a hearing under this part.

              (a) A charge of misconduct for wrongful possession, use, sale, or association with dangerous drugs is found proved. In those cases involving marijuana, the Administrative Law Judge may enter an order less than revocation when satisfied that the use, possession or association, was the result of experimentation by the respondent and that the respondent has submitted satisfactory evidence that he or she is cured of such use and that the possession or association will not recur.

              (b) The respondent has been a user of, or addicted to the use of, a dangerous drug, or has been convicted for a violation of the dangerous drug laws, whether or not further court action is pending, and such charge is found proved. A conviction becomes final when no issue of law or fact determinative of the respondent's guilt remains to be decided.

              (2) Violated or failed to comply with subtitle II of title 46, U.S.C., a regulation prescribed under this subtitle, or any other law or regulations intended to promote marine safety or to protect the navigable waters, while acting under the authority of a credential or endorsement;
              (3) Been convicted of a dangerous drug law violation, or has been a user of, or addicted to the use of, a dangerous drug, so as to be subject to the provisions of 46 U.S.C. 7704.

              (b) In order to promote full disclosure and facilitate determinations as to the cause of marine casualties, no admission made by a person during an investigation under this part or part 4 of this title may be used against that person in a proceeding under this part, except for impeachment.

              (b) Accept voluntary surrender of a credential or endorsement.
              (c) Accept voluntary deposit of a credential or endorsement.
              (d) Refer the case to others for further action.

              (e) Give a written warning. The investigating officer may give a warning to any person holding a credential or endorsement. Refusal to accept the written warning will normally result in a withdrawal of the warning and the preferral of charges. An unrejected warning will become a part of the person's record.
              (f) Close the case.

              Voluntary deposits in event of mental or physical incompetence.
              (a) A holder may deposit a credential or endorsement with the Coast Guard in any case where there is evidence of mental or physical incompetence. A voluntary deposit is accepted on the basis of a written agreement, the original of which will be given to the holder, which specifies the conditions upon which the Coast Guard will return the credential or endorsement to the holder.
              (b) Where the mental or physical incompetence of a holder of a credential or endorsement is caused by use of or addiction to dangerous drugs, a voluntary deposit will only be accepted contingent on the following circumstances:

              (2) The holder's incompetence did not cause or contribute to a marine casualty,

              (4) The holder has not voluntarily deposited or surrendered a credential or endorsement, or had a credential or endorsement revoked for a drug related offense on a prior occasion.
              
              (c) Where the mental or physical incompetence of a holder of a credential or endorsement is caused by use or addiction to alcohol, a voluntary deposit will only be accepted contingent on the following circumstances:

              (2) The holder's incompetence did not cause or contribute to a marine casualty; and

              (b) Where the voluntary deposit is based on incompetence due to drug abuse, the deposit agreement shall provide that the credential or endorsement will not be returned until the person:
              (1) Successfully completes a bona fide drug abuse rehabilitation program;
              (2) Demonstrates complete non-association with dangerous drugs for a minimum of six months after completion of the rehabilitation program; and

              (2) Is actively participating in a bona fide alcohol abuse monitoring program.
              (d) The voluntary surrender of a credential or endorsement is the equivalent of revocation of such papers.

              (b) The investigating officer may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or for the production of books, papers, documents, or any other relevant evidence needed by the investigating officer or by the respondent.
              (c) After charges have been served upon the respondent the Administrative Law Judge may, either on the Administrative Law Judge's own motion or the motion of the investigating officer or respondent, issue subpoenas for the attendance and the giving of testimony by witnesses or for the production of books, papers, documents, or any other relevant evidence.

              Service of subpoenas on behalf of the respondent.
              Service of subpoenas issued on behalf of the respondent is the responsibility of the respondent. However, if the Administrative Law Judge finds that the respondent or respondent's counsel is physically unable to effect the service, despite diligent and bona fide attempts to do so, and if the Administrative Law Judge further finds that the existing impediment to the service of the subpoena is peculiarly within the authority of the Coast Guard to overcome, the Administrative Law Judge will have the subpoena delivered to an investigating officer participating in the case for the purpose of effecting service.
            
            
              § 5.305

              Upon application and for good cause shown, or upon its own initiative, the Coast Guard will seek judicial enforcement of subpoenas issued by investigating officers or Administrative Law Judges. This is done by making application to the United States District Court, through the office of the appropriate U.S. Attorney, to issue an order compelling the attendance of, and/or giving of testimony by, witnesses, or for the production of books, papers, documents, or any other relevant evidence.
            
            
              § 5.309

              (a) The person serving a subpoena shall make a written statement setting forth the date, time and manner of service and shall return such report with or on a copy of the subpoena to the investigating officer or Administrative Law Judge who issued it. In case of failure to make service of a subpoena, the person assigned to serve such subpoena shall make a written statement setting forth the reasons the subpoena was not served. The statement should be placed on the subpoena or attached to it and returned to the investigating office or Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoena.
              (b) When service of a subpoena is made by certified mail with return receipt to be signed by the addressee only, the person mailing the subpoena shall make a written statement on a copy of the subpoena or attached to it, setting forth the date, time and location of the post office where mailed, the post office number assigned thereto. If delivered, the receipt requested shall be returned, by the person receiving the receipt, to the investigating officer or Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoena. In case the subpoena is not delivered, any information reported by the post office regarding non-delivery shall be given to the investigating officer or Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoena.

              § 5.521
              Verification of credential or endorsement.
              (a) The Administrative Law Judge shall require the respondent to produce and present at the opening of the hearing, and on each day the hearing is in session thereafter, all valid credentials issued by the Coast Guard to the respondent. In the event that the respondent alleges that credential has been lost, misplaced, stolen, destroyed, or is otherwise beyond his ability to produce, the respondent shall execute a lost document affidavit (Form CG-4363). The Administrative Law Judge shall warn the respondent that a willful misstatement of any material item in such affidavit is punishable as a violation of a Federal criminal statute. (See 18 U.S.C. 1001).
              (b) When a hearing is continued or delayed, the Administrative Law Judge returns the credential to the respondent: unless a prima facie case has been established that the respondent committed an act or offense which shows that the respondent's service on a vessel would constitute a definite danger to public health, interest or safety at sea.

              § 5.567
              Order.

              (a) The Administrative Law Judge enters an order which recites the disposition of the case. When the finding is not proved, the Administrative Law Judge issues an order dismissing the proceeding with or without prejudice to refile. When the finding is proved, the Administrative Law Judge may order an admonition, suspension with or without probation, or revocation.
              
              (b) The order is directed against all credentials or endorsements, except that in cases of negligence or professional incompetence, the order is made applicable to specific credentials or endorsements. If the Administrative Law Judge determines that the respondent is professionally incompetent in the grade of the license, certificate or document held, but is considered competent in a lower grade, the credential or endorsement may be revoked and the issuance of one of a lower grade ordered.
              (c) An order must specify whether the credential or endorsement affected is:
              (1) Revoked;
              (2) Suspended outright for a specified period after surrender;
              (3) Suspended for a specified period, but placed on probation for a specific period; or
              (4) Suspended outright for a specified period, followed by a specified period of suspension on probation.
              (d) The order will normally state, that the credential or endorsement is to be surrendered to the Coast Guard immediately, if the order is one of revocation or includes a period of outright suspension. In cases involving special circumstances, the order may provide for surrender on a certain date.
              (e) The time of any period of outright suspension ordered does not commence until the credential or endorsement is surrendered to the Coast Guard. The time of any period of suspension on probation begins at the end of any period of outright suspension or the effective date of the order if there is no outright suspension.

              § 5.569
              Selection of an appropriate order.
              (a) This section addresses orders in a general manner. The selection of an appropriate order is the responsibility of the Administrative Law Judge, subject to appeal and review. The investigating officer and the respondent may suggest an order and present argument in support of this suggestion during the presentation of aggravating or mitigating evidence.
              (b) Except for acts or offenses for which revocation is mandatory, factors which may affect the order include:
              (1) Remedial actions which have been undertaken independently by the respondent;
              (2) Prior record of the respondent, considering the period of time between prior acts and the act or offense for which presently charged is relevant; and
              (3) Evidence of mitigation or aggravation.
              (c) After an order of revocation is entered, the respondent will be given an opportunity to present relevant material on the record for subsequent consideration by the special board convened in the event an application is filed in accordance with subpart L of this part.

              (d) Table 5.569 is for the information and guidance of Administrative Law Judges and is intended to promote uniformity in orders rendered. This table should not affect the fair and impartial adjudication of each case on its individual facts and merits. The orders are expressed by a range, in months of outright suspension, considered appropriate for the particular act or offense prior to considering matters in mitigation or aggravation. For instance, without considering other factors, a period of two to four months outright suspension is considered appropriate for failure to obey a master's written instructions. An order within the range would not be considered excessive. Mitigating or aggravating factors may make an order greater or less than the given range appropriate. Orders for repeat offenders will ordinarily be greater than those specified.

              (a) Whether each finding of fact rests on substantial evidence.
              
              (b) Whether each conclusion of law accords with applicable law, precedent, and public policy.
              (c) Whether the ALJ committed any abuses of discretion.

              § 5.707
              Stay of effect of decision and order of Administrative Law Judge on appeal to the Commandant; temporary credential or endorsement.
              (a) A person who has appealed from a decision suspending outright or revoking a credential or endorsement, except for revocation resulting from an offense enumerated in § 5.59, may file a written request for a temporary credential or endorsement. This request must be submitted to the Administrative Law Judge who presided over the case, or to any Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection for forwarding to the Administrative Law Judge.
              (b) Action on the request is taken by the ALJ unless the hearing transcript has been forwarded to the Commandant, in which case, the Commandant will make the final action.
              (c) A determination as to the request will take into consideration whether the service of the individual is compatible with the requirements for safety at sea and consistent with applicable laws. If one of the offenses enumerated in § 5.61(a) has been found proved, the continued service of the appellant will be presumed not compatible with safety at sea, subject to rebuttal by the appellant. A temporary credential or endorsement may be denied for that reason alone.
              (d) All temporary credentials or endorsements will provide that they expire not more than six months after issuance or upon service of the Commandant's decision on appeal, whichever occurs first. If a temporary credential or endorsement expires before the Commandant's decision is rendered, it may be renewed, if authorized by the Commandant.
              (e) If the request for a temporary credential or endorsement is denied by the Administrative Law Judge, the individual may appeal the denial, in writing, to the Commandant within 30 days after notification of such denial. Any decision by the Commandant to deny is the final agency action.
              (f) Copies of the temporary credential issued become a part of the record on appeal.

These rules give the party adversely affected by the Commandant's decision 10 days after service upon him or his attorney of the Commandant's decision to file a notice of appeal with the Board.

If one of the offenses enumerated in § 5.61(a) has been found proved, the continued service of the appellant will be presumed not compatible with safety at sea, subject to rebuttal by the appellant; in cases of offenses under § 5.61(a), a temporary credential and/or endorsement may be denied for that reason alone.
              (b) A stay of the effect of the Decision of the Commandant on Appeal may be granted by the Commandant upon application by the respondent filed with the notice served on the Commandant under 49 CFR 825.5(b).

            § 6.01
            Procedures for effecting individual waivers of navigation and vessel inspection laws and regulations.
            (a) It is hereby found necessary in the interest of national defense to waive compliance with the navigation and vessel inspection laws administered by the Coast Guard, as well as the regulations issued thereunder and published in 33 CFR chapter I or in this chapter, to the extent and in the manner and upon the terms and conditions as set forth in this section.
            (b) An application requesting that a waiver be made effective, with respect to a particular vessel, may be made by any authorized representative of an agency of the United States Government or any other interested person (including the master, agent, or owner of the vessel involved). Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the application shall be in writing. The application shall be delivered to the Coast Guard District Commander or to his designated representative at the port or place where the vessel is located. In the case of a vessel in any foreign port or place, the application shall be made to the designated representative of the Commandant at such port or place, or if the Coast Guard has not established facilities in such port or place, to the nearest designated representative of the Commandant at a port or place where such facilities have been established. Every application shall contain a statement of the particular provisions of law with respect to which waiver of compliance is requested, a certification that the waiver of compliance with such laws with respect to the vessel involved is necessary in the interest of national defense and, an outline of the facts upon which such certification is based. The Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative or the designated representative of the Commandant, as the case may be) shall promptly examine every application for the purpose of determining whether the necessity for prompt action is such as to require that the waiver be made effective by him without reference to the Commandant. In any case in which it appears to the Coast Guard officer concerned that reference of the application to the Commandant for action would not delay the sailing of the vessel or otherwise be contrary to the interest of national defense, the application shall be so referred. In all other cases, such Coast Guard officer shall give immediate consideration to the application and if he reaches the conclusion that the urgency of the situation outweighs the marine hazard involved, then such waiver shall be made effective in regard to such vessel to the extent and under the circumstances specified by him.
            (c) The Coast Guard officer making such a waiver effective pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall immediately prepare, in triplicate, an order setting forth the name of the vessel involved, the laws (also regulations, if any) with respect to which the waiver is effective, the extent to which compliance with such laws (also regulations, if any) is waived, and the period for which the waiver shall be effective. If practicable, one copy of this order shall be delivered to the master of the vessel involved before such vessel sails. In any case where the order is not delivered to the master, it shall be delivered to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel without delay. One copy of the order shall be transmitted to the Commandant and the remaining copy kept on file.
            (d) In any case of extreme urgency the application for a waiver may be made orally, and if the Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative or the designated representative of the Commandant, as the case may be) reaches the conclusion referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, the waiver shall be made effective without further delay, subject to the condition that the application be reduced to writing and delivered within such period after the date of the oral request as the Coast Guard officer making the waiver effective shall specify in the order.

            (e) No penalty shall be imposed because of failure to comply with any provision of law (or regulation, if any), the waiver of which has been made effective pursuant to the requirements in this section.

            (b) An application requesting that this waiver be made effective with respect to a particular vessel may be made by the Commander, Military Sealift Command, or any one of his duly designated representatives. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the application shall be in writing. The application shall be delivered to the Coast Guard District Commander or to his designated representative at the port or place where the vessel is located. In the case of a vessel in any foreign port or place, the application shall be made to the designated representative of the Commandant at such port or place, or if the Coast Guard has not established facilities in such port or place, to the nearest designated representative of the Commandant at a port or place where such facilities have been established, or to the Commandant (CG-CVC), Attn: Office of Commercial Vessel Compliance, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7501, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7501. Every application shall:
            (1) Describe the laws and/or regulations by appropriate references and/or subjects with respect to which the waiver of compliance is desired;
            (2) Contain a certification that the waiver of compliance with such laws and/or regulations with respect to the vessel involved is necessary in the interest of national defense and is necessary for the Military Sealift Command to carry out an assigned mission;
            (3) The name and official number of the vessel involved (including the names of master, agent, and owner of the vessel involved); and,
            (4) For how long the waiver is needed.
            (c) The Coast Guard officer making the waiver in paragraph (a) of this section, effective for a particular vessel, shall immediately prepare, in quadruplicate, an order setting forth:
            (1) The name and official number of the vessel involved;
            (2) The laws and/or regulations with respect to which the waiver is effective;
            (3) The extent to which compliance with such laws and/or regulations is waived; and,
            (4) The period for which the waiver shall be effective.

            (d) If practicable, one copy of this waiver order shall be delivered to the master of the vessel involved before such vessel sails. In any case where the waiver order is not delivered to the master, it shall be delivered to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel without delay. One copy of the waiver order shall be delivered to the Commander, Military Sealift Command, or his duly designated representative, who submitted the application. One copy of the waiver order shall be transmitted to the Commandant (G-MOC) and the remaining copy kept on file.
            (e) In any case of extreme urgency, the application for a waiver order may be made orally and if the Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative, or the designated representative of the Commandant, or the Commandant, as the case may be), determines that the conditions in this section have been met, the waiver order shall be made effective without further delay, subject to the condition that the application be reduced to writing and delivered within such period after the date of the oral request as the Coast Guard officer making the waiver effective shall specify in the confirming written waiver order.
            (f) No penalty shall be imposed because of failure to comply with any provision of law and/or regulation, the waiver of which has been made effective pursuant to the requirements of this section.

            (g) This waiver order shall remain in effect until terminated by proper authority and notice of cancellation is published in the Federal Register.

            § 9.6
            Rate for night service.

            The rate of extra compensation for authorized overtime services performed at night on any week day is hereby fixed at one half the gross daily rate of regular pay of the employee who performs the services for each 2 hours of compensable time, any fraction of 2 hours amounting to at least one hour to be counted as 2 hours. In computing the amount earned, each 2 hours is the time period for the purpose of computation, at least one hour means the minimum service in each period for which extra pay may be granted. If service continues beyond a 2 hour period, it must extend for at least one hour into the following 2 hour period to be entitled to extra pay for the second period. When the overtime extends beyond 5 p.m., payment of extra compensation from 5 p.m. for services consisting of at least one hour is authorized, even though such services may not actually begin until 7 p.m., 9 p.m., or later: Provided, That the officer rendering the service remained on duty from 5 p.m., in which case the time between 5 p.m., and the time of beginning the actual service shall be computed as waiting time; and where the actual services begin as late as 9 p.m., there should be an affirmative statement that the officer was required to remain on duty between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., if a charge for waiting time is made. The maximum amount of extra compensation which may be paid an employee for services during one night shall not exceed two and one-half times the gross daily rate of his regular pay.
          
          
            § 9.7
            Rate for Sunday or holiday services.

            The rate of extra compensation for Sunday or holiday services is hereby fixed at twice the gross daily rate of regular pay of the employee who performs the service, for any and all services totaling an aggregate of not more than nine hours, with one hour for food and rest, during the 24 hours from midnight to midnight of the Sunday or holiday including actual waiting time and time required for travel between posts of duty but not including other time not spent at the post of duty. This rate shall apply regardless of the length of time served within the aggregate of the aforesaid 9 hours, whether it is served continuously or in broken periods, and whether it is served for one or more applicants.

The maximum amount which may be paid an employee for services performed during the 24 hours of a Sunday or holiday shall not exceed four and one-half times the gross daily rate of his regular pay.

            § 9.11
            Proration of charges.

                Ballast control operator or BCO means an officer restricted to service on mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) whose duties involve the operation of the complex ballast system found on many MODUs. When assigned to a MODU, a ballast control operator is equivalent to a mate on a conventional vessel.
              
                Barge means a non-self propelled vessel as defined in 46 U.S.C 102.
              
                Barge supervisor or BS means an officer restricted to service on MODUs whose duties involve support to the offshore installation manager (OIM) in marine-related matters including, but not limited to, maintaining watertight integrity, inspecting and maintaining mooring and towing components, and maintaining emergency and other marine-related equipment.

                Chemical tanker means a tank vessel that is certificated to carry or carries chemicals in bulk as cargo or cargo residue. For the purposes of qualifying for an STCW endorsement for advanced chemical tanker cargo operations, this includes tank barges.
              
                Chief engineer means the senior engineer responsible for the mechanical propulsion and the operation and maintenance of the mechanical and electrical installations of the vessel.

              (2) From a port or place in a United States possession to another port or place in the same possession, and passes outside the line dividing inland waters from the high seas; or
              (3) From a port or place in the United States or its possessions and passes outside the line dividing inland waters from the high seas and navigates on the high seas, and then returns to the same port or place.
              
                Communicable disease means any disease capable of being transmitted from one person to another directly, by contact with excreta or other discharges from the body; or indirectly, via substances or inanimate objects contaminated with excreta or other discharges from an infected person. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 12113, the Department of Health and Human Services periodically publishes in the Federal Register a list of infectious and communicable diseases that are transmissible through the food supply, and that list provides examples of communicable diseases for purposes of § 10.304 of this title.
              
                Conviction means that the applicant for a merchant mariner credential has been found guilty, by judgment or plea by a court of record of the United States, the District of Columbia, any State, territory, or possession of the United States, a foreign country, or any military court, of a criminal felony or misdemeanor or of an offense described in section 205 of the National Driver Register Act of 1982, as amended (49 U.S.C. 30304). If an applicant pleads guilty or no contest, is granted deferred adjudication, or is required by the court to attend classes, make contributions of time or money, receive treatment, submit to any manner of probation or supervision, or forgo appeal of a trial court's conviction, then the Coast Guard will consider the applicant to have received a conviction. A later expungement of the conviction will not negate a conviction unless the Coast Guard is satisfied that the expungement is based upon a showing that the court's earlier conviction was in error.
              
                Credential means any or all of the following:
              (1) Merchant mariner's document.

                Criminal record review means the process or action taken by the Coast Guard to determine whether an applicant for, or holder of, a credential is a safe and suitable person to be issued such a credential or to be employed on a vessel under the authority of such a credential.
              
                Dangerous drug means a narcotic drug, a controlled substance, or a controlled-substance analogue (as defined in section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802)).
              
                Dangerous liquid or DL means a liquid listed in 46 CFR 153.40 of this chapter that is not a liquefied gas as defined in this part. Liquid cargoes in bulk listed in 46 CFR part 153, Table 2, of this chapter are not dangerous-liquid cargoes when carried by non-oceangoing barges.
              
                Day means, for the purpose of complying with the service requirements of this subchapter, 8 hours of watchstanding or day-working not to include overtime. On vessels authorized by 46 U.S.C. 8104 and 46 CFR 15.705, to operate a two-watch system, a 12-hour working day may be creditable as 11/2 days of service. On vessels of less than 100 GRT, a day is considered as 8 hours unless the Coast Guard determines that the vessel's operating schedule makes this criteria inappropriate; in no case will this period be less than 4 hours.

            Subpart B—General Requirements for All Merchant Mariner Credentials
            
              § 10.201
              General characteristics of the merchant mariner credential.
              (a) A merchant mariner credential (MMC) (Coast Guard Form CG-4610), is a credential combining the elements of the merchant mariner's document (MMD), merchant mariner's license (license), and certificate of registry (COR) enumerated in 46 U.S.C. subtitle II part E as well as the STCW endorsement issued pursuant to the STCW Convention and STCW Code (incorporated by reference, see § 10.103 of this part). MMDs, licenses, STCW endorsements and CORs are no longer issued as separate documents and all qualifications formerly entered on those separate documents appear in the form of an endorsement(s) on an MMC.
              (b) An MMC authorizes the holder to serve in any capacity endorsed thereon, or in any lower capacity in the same department, or in any capacity covered by a general endorsement.
              (c) An MMC may be issued to qualified applicants by the Coast Guard.
              [USCG-2006-24371, 74 FR 11216, Mar. 16, 2009, as amended by USCG-2004-17914, 78 FR 77888, Dec. 24, 2013]
            
            
              § 10.203
              Requirement to hold a TWIC and a merchant mariner credential.
              (a) Failure to obtain or hold a valid TWIC serves as a basis for the denial of an application for an original, renewal, new endorsement, duplicate, or raise of grade of a mariner's credential and may serve as a basis for suspension and revocation under 46 U.S.C. 7702 and 7703.
              (b) An MMC, license, MMD, COR, or STCW endorsement must be retained by the mariner to whom it was issued and, while valid, must be produced to verify qualifications when requested by an authorized official as identified in 33 CFR 101.515(d). Posting of the officer endorsement may be necessary as required in 46 U.S.C. 7110.
              (c) Although an MMD and an MMC serve as certificates of identification, a TWIC must be retained by the mariner to whom it was issued and, while valid, serves as the mariner's primary identification document. The TWIC must be produced to verify identity when required by an authorized official as identified in 33 CFR 101.515(d).
              [USCG-2006-24371, 74 FR 11216, Mar. 16, 2009, as amended by USCG-2018-0874, 84 FR 30881, June 28, 2019]
            
            
              § 10.205
              Validity of a merchant mariner credential.
              (a) An MMC is valid for a term of 5 years from the date of issuance. Except upon the written request for the immediate issuance by the applicant, the Coast Guard will post-date the issuance of an MMC renewal that includes no other transactions up to 8 months from the date that the Coast Guard accepts a complete application as required in this part. If the expiration date of the mariner's active credential is beyond 8 months of the date that the Coast Guard accepts a complete application as required in this part, the new credential issue date will be 8 months from the date of application acceptance at which time the currently active credential will become invalid in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. Otherwise, the new credential issue validity date will coincide with the expiration date of the active credential held by the mariner. All other MMC transactions will be processed for immediate issuance.
              (b) All endorsements, unless otherwise noted, are valid until the expiration date of the MMC on which they appear.
              (c) A mariner may not serve under the authority of an MMC past its expiration date. An expired MMC may be renewed during an administrative grace period of up to 1 year beyond its expiration date as per § 10.227(h) of this part.
              (d) When an MMC is renewed or re-issued before its expiration date in accordance with § 10.227, of this part the MMC that has been replaced becomes invalid unless otherwise noted in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (e) An MMC is not valid until signed by the applicant and a duly authorized Coast Guard official.

              (f) A mariner's endorsements authorize the holder to serve in any capacity endorsed on the MMC, or in any lower capacity in the same department, or in any capacity covered by a general endorsement thereon.
              (g) If a mariner chooses to renew his or her license, MMD, COR, or STCW endorsement and receive their first MMC, the Coast Guard may also renew all other credentials for which the mariner is qualified.
              (h) When a Document of Continuity is replaced with an MMC re-issued in accordance with § 10.227 of this part, the Document of Continuity that has been replaced becomes invalid. In the event that not all endorsements on a Document of Continuity are activated, a new Document of Continuity will be issued for the remaining endorsements.

              § 10.207
              Identification number.
              For recordkeeping purposes only, a mariner's official MMC identification number is the individual's social security number. However, a unique serial number, called the mariner reference number, and not the social security number, will appear on the credential.

              (a) The applicant for an MMC, whether for an original, renewal, duplicate, raise of grade, or a new endorsement on a previously issued MMC, must establish that he or she satisfies all the requirements for the MMC and endorsement(s) sought before the Coast Guard will issue the MMC. This section contains the general requirements for all applicants. Additional requirements for duplicates, renewals, new endorsements, and raises of grade appear later in this part.
              (b) The Coast Guard may refuse to process an incomplete MMC application.

              (d) The application may be submitted in person, by mail, fax, or other electronic means. A complete MMC application, which is described in §§ 10.223, 10.225, 10.227, 10.229, and 10.231 may include—

              (4) Copies of course completion certificates or other evidence of course completion;
              (5) Evidence of sea service, or an accepted substitute for sea service, if required;

Any MMC issued will retain any limitation associated with the medical license;
              (7) Any certificates or other supplementary materials required to show that the mariner meets the mandatory requirements for the specific endorsement sought, as established in parts 11, 12 or 13 of this subchapter; and

              (e) The following requirements must be satisfied before an original or renewal MMC, or new endorsement or a raise of grade added to a previously issued MMC, will be issued. These materials will be added to the individual's record by the Coast Guard:
              (1) Determination of safety and suitability. No MMC will be issued as an original or reissued with a new expiration date, and no new officer endorsement will be issued if the applicant fails the criminal record review as set forth in § 10.211 of this part.

              (3) Information supplied by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). No MMC or endorsement will be issued until the Coast Guard receives the following information from the applicant's TWIC enrollment: the applicant's fingerprints, FBI number and criminal record (if applicable), photograph, proof of citizenship, or Nationality with proof of legal resident status (if applicable). If the information is not available from TSA, the mariner may be required to visit a Regional Exam Center or a TWIC enrollment center to provide this information.
              (f) Upon determining that the applicant satisfactorily meets all requirements for an MMC or an endorsement thereon, the Coast Guard will issue the properly endorsed MMC to the applicant. The Coast Guard will not issue an MMC until it has received proof that the mariner holds a valid TWIC.
              (g) When a new MMC is issued, the mariner must return any previously issued and unexpired MMC, license, MMD, COR, or STCW endorsement to the Coast Guard, unless the new MMC is being issued to replace a lost or stolen credential.
              (h) No MMC will be issued if the applicant fails a chemical test for dangerous drugs as required in §§ 10.223, 10.225(b)(5), 10.227(d)(5), and 10.231(c)(6).
              (i) Ceremonial licenses. A mariner may obtain a ceremonial license when applying for his or her credential or Document of Continuity.

              § 10.211
              Criminal record review.
              (a) The Coast Guard may conduct a criminal record review to determine the safety and suitability of an applicant for an MMC and any endorsements. An applicant conducting simultaneous MMC transactions will undergo a single criminal record review. At the time of application, each applicant must provide written disclosure of all prior convictions not previously disclosed to the Coast Guard on an application.
              (b) A criminal record review is not required for applicants seeking a duplicate MMC under § 10.229.
              (c) Fingerprints. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will provide to the Coast Guard the applicant's fingerprints submitted by the applicant with his or her TWIC application and, if applicable, the applicant's FBI number and criminal record generated in the TWIC review process. This information, or the fingerprints taken by the Coast Guard at an REC, will be used by the Coast Guard to determine whether the applicant has a record of any criminal convictions.
              (d) When a criminal record review leads the Coast Guard to determine that an applicant is not a safe and suitable person or cannot be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of the MMC or endorsement applied for, the application may be denied.
              (e) If an application is denied, the applicant will be notified in writing of that fact, the reason or reasons for denial, and advised that the appeal procedures in subpart 1.03 of part 1 of this chapter apply. No examination will be given pending decision on appeal.

              (f) No person who has been convicted of a violation of the dangerous drug laws of the United States, the District of Columbia, any State, territory, or possession of the United States, or a foreign country, by any military or civilian court, is eligible for an MMC, except as provided elsewhere in this section. No person who has ever been the user of, or addicted to the use of a dangerous drug, or has ever been convicted of an offense described in section 205 of the National Driver Register Act of 1982, as amended (49 U.S.C. 30304) because of addiction to or abuse of alcohol is eligible for an MMC, unless he or she furnishes satisfactory evidence of suitability for service in the merchant marine as provided in paragraph (l) of this section. A conviction for a drug offense more than 10 years before the date of application will not alone be grounds for denial.
              (g) The Coast Guard will use table 1 to § 10.211 of this section to evaluate applicants who have criminal convictions. The table lists major categories of criminal activity and is not to be construed as an all-inclusive list. If an applicant is convicted of an offense that does not appear on the list, the Coast Guard will establish an appropriate assessment period using the list as a guide. The assessment period commences when an applicant is no longer incarcerated. The applicant must establish proof of the time incarcerated and periods of probation and parole to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard. The assessment period may include supervised or unsupervised probation or parole.

                  1 Conviction of attempts, solicitations, aiding and abetting, accessory after the fact, and conspiracies to commit the criminal conduct listed in this table carry the same minimum and maximum assessment periods provided in the table.
                
                  2 Other crimes will be reviewed by the Coast Guard to determine the minimum and maximum assessment periods depending on the nature of the crime.
                
                  3 Applicable to original applications only. Any applicant who has ever been the user of, or addicted to the use of, a dangerous drug shall meet the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. Note: Applicants for reissue of an MMC with a new expiration date including a renewal or additional endorsement(s), who have been convicted of a dangerous drug offense while holding a license, MMC, MMD, STCW endorsement or COR, may have their application withheld until appropriate action has been completed by the Coast Guard under the regulations which appear in 46 CFR part 5 governing the administrative actions against merchant mariner credentials.
                

                  4 The Coast Guard may consider dangerous drug convictions more than 10 years old only if there has been another dangerous drug conviction within the past 10 years.
                
                
                  5 Applicants must demonstrate rehabilitation under paragraph (l) of this section, including applicants with dangerous drug use convictions more than 10 years old.
                
                  6 Other dangerous drug convictions will be reviewed by the Coast Guard on a case by case basis to determine the appropriate assessment period depending on the nature of the offense.
              
              (h) When an applicant has convictions for more than one offense, the minimum assessment period will be the longest minimum in table 1 to § 10.211 of this section and table 10.213(c) in § 10.213 based upon the applicant's convictions; the maximum assessment period will be the longest shown in table 1 to § 10.211 of this section and table 10.213(c) of § 10.213 based upon the applicant's convictions.
              (i) If a person with a criminal conviction applies before the minimum assessment period shown in table 1 to § 10.211 of this section of this section or established by the Coast Guard under paragraph (g) of this section has elapsed, then the applicant must provide, as part of the application package, evidence of suitability for service in the merchant marine. Factors that are evidence of suitability for service in the merchant marine are listed in paragraph (l) of this section. The Coast Guard will consider the applicant's evidence submitted with the application and may issue the MMC and/or endorsement in less than the listed minimum assessment period if the Coast Guard is satisfied that the applicant is suitable to hold the MMC and/or endorsement for which he or she has applied. If an application filed before the minimum assessment period has elapsed does not include evidence of suitability for service in the merchant marine, then the application will be considered incomplete and will not be processed by the Coast Guard.
              (j) If a person with a criminal conviction submits his or her MMC application during the time between the minimum and maximum assessment periods shown in table 1 to § 10.211 or established by the Coast Guard under paragraph (g) of this section, then the Coast Guard will consider the conviction and, unless there are offsetting factors, will grant the applicant the MMC and/or endorsement for which he or she has applied. Offsetting factors include such factors as multiple convictions, failure to comply with court orders (e.g., child support orders), previous failures at rehabilitation or reform, inability to maintain steady employment, or any connection between the crime and the safe operation of a vessel. If the Coast Guard considers the applicant unsuitable for service in the merchant marine at the time of application, the Coast Guard may deny the application.
              (k) If a person with a criminal conviction submits his or her MMC application after the maximum assessment period shown in table 1 to § 10.211 of this section or established by the Coast Guard under paragraph (g) of this section has elapsed, then the Coast Guard will grant the applicant the MMC or endorsement for which he or she has applied unless the Coast Guard considers the applicant still unsuitable for service in the merchant marine. If the Coast Guard disapproves an applicant with a conviction older than the maximum assessment period listed in table 1 to § 10.211 of this section , the Coast Guard will notify the applicant in writing of the reason(s) for the disapproval. The Coast Guard will also inform the applicant, in writing, that the reconsideration and appeal procedures contained in subpart 1.03 of this chapter apply.
              (l) If an applicant has one or more alcohol or dangerous drug related criminal or NDR-listed convictions, if the applicant has ever been the user of, or addicted to the use of, a dangerous drug, or if the applicant applies before the minimum assessment period has elapsed for his or her conviction, the Coast Guard may consider the following factors, as applicable, in assessing the applicant's suitability to hold an MMC. This list is intended as a guide for the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard may consider other factors appropriate to a particular applicant, such as:

              (1) Proof of completion of an accredited alcohol or drug abuse rehabilitation program;
              
              (2) Active membership in a rehabilitation or counseling group, such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous;
              (3) Character references from persons who can attest to the applicant's sobriety, reliability, and suitability for employment in the merchant marine including parole or probation officers;
              (4) Steady employment; and
              (5) Successful completion of all conditions of parole or probation.

              (a) No MMC will be issued as an original or reissued with a new expiration date, and no new officer endorsement will be issued, unless the applicant consents to a check of the NDR for offenses described in section 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the NDR Act (i.e., operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of, or impaired by, alcohol or a controlled substance; and any traffic violations arising in connection with a fatal traffic accident, reckless driving, or racing on the highways).
              (b) The Coast Guard will not consider NDR-listed civil convictions that are more than 3 years old from the date of request unless that information relates to a current suspension or revocation of the applicant's license to operate a motor vehicle. The Coast Guard may determine minimum and maximum assessment periods for NDR-listed criminal convictions using table 10.213(c) of this section. An applicant conducting simultaneous MMC transactions is subject to only one NDR check.
              (c) The guidelines in table 1 to paragraph (c) will be used by the Coast Guard in evaluating applicants who have drug or alcohol related NDR-listed convictions. Non-drug or alcohol related NDR-listed convictions will be evaluated by the Coast Guard under table 1 to § 10.211 of this part as applicable. The Coast Guard may consider non-drug or alcohol related NDR-listed convictions that are more than 3 years old from the date of the request when the information relates to a current suspension or revocation of the applicant's license to operate a motor vehicle.

              (d) Any application may be denied if information from the NDR check leads the Coast Guard to determine that the applicant cannot be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of the endorsement for which the application is made. If an application is denied, the Coast Guard will notify the applicant in writing of the reason(s) for denial and advise the applicant that the appeal procedures in subpart 1.03 of part 1 of this chapter apply. No examination will be given pending decision on appeal.

              (e) Before denying an application because of information received from the NDR, the Coast Guard will make the information available to the applicant for review and written comment. The applicant may submit records from the applicable State concerning driving record and convictions to the Coast Guard processing the application. The Coast Guard will hold an application with NDR-listed convictions pending the completion of the evaluation and delivery by the individual of the underlying State records.
              (f) If an applicant has one or more alcohol or dangerous drug-related criminal or NDR-listed convictions, if the applicant has ever been the user of, or addicted to the use of, a dangerous drug, or if the applicant applies before the minimum assessment period for his or her conviction has elapsed, the Coast Guard may consider the following factors, as applicable, in assessing the applicant's suitability to hold an MMC. This list is intended as a guide for the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard may consider other factors which it judges appropriate to a particular applicant, such as—
              (1) Proof of completion of an accredited alcohol or drug abuse rehabilitation program;
              (2) Active membership in a rehabilitation or counseling group, such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous;

              (a) Applicants for an MMC may apply to any of the Regional Examination Centers (RECs) or any other location designated by the Coast Guard. Applicants may contact the National Maritime Center at 100 Forbes Drive, Martinsburg, WV 25404, by telephone 1-888-427-5662 or 304-433-3400, or by email at IASKNMC@uscg.mil.

              (b) Fee payment procedures. Applicants may pay—
              (1) All fees required by this section at the time the application is submitted; or
              (2) A fee for each phase as follows:
              (i) An evaluation fee when the application is submitted.
              (ii) An examination fee before the first examination section is taken.
              (iii) An issuance fee before issuance of the MMC.
              (c) If the examination is administered at a place other than a Regional Examination Center (REC), the examination fee must be paid to the REC at least one week before the scheduled examination date.
              (d) Unless the Coast Guard provides additional payment options, fees must be paid as follows:
              (1) Fee payments must be for the exact amount.

              (2) Fee payments may be made by electronic payment in a manner specified by the Coast Guard. For information regarding current forms of electronic payment, go to the National Maritime Center's (NMC) Web site, www.uscg.mil/nmc. To assist with the automation of mariner credential applications, applicants are encouraged to pay the fees electronically.
              (3) Payments may be made by cash, check, money order, or credit card.

              (4) Payments submitted by mail may not be made in cash. Mailed payments should specify the type of credential sought and the type of fee (e.g., evaluation, examination, issuance) being paid. The address for sending payment by mail can be found at the NMC Web site, www.uscg.mil/nmc.
              
              (5) Checks or money orders must be made payable to the U.S. Coast Guard, and the full legal name and last four digits of applicant's social security number must appear on the front of each check or money order.
              (e) Unless otherwise specified in this part, when two or more endorsements are processed on the same application the fees will be as follows:
              (1) Evaluation fees. If an applicant simultaneously applies for a rating endorsement and a deck or engineer officer's endorsement, only the evaluation fee for the officer's endorsement will be charged. If an applicant simultaneously applies for a staff officer or radio officer endorsement along with the deck or engineer officer endorsement, only the evaluation fee for the deck or engineer officer's endorsement will be charged. No evaluation fee is charged for an STCW endorsement.
              (2) Examination fees. One examination fee will be charged for each exam or series of exams for an original, raise of grade, or renewal of an endorsement on an MMC taken within 1 year from the date of the application approval. An examination fee will also be charged to process an open-book exercise used to renew an MMC. If an officer endorsement examination under part 11 of this chapter also fulfills the examination requirements in part 12 of this chapter for rating endorsements, only the fee for the officer endorsement examination is charged.
              (3) Issuance fees. Only one issuance fee will be charged for each MMC issued, regardless of the number of endorsements placed on the credential. There is no fee for a Document of Continuity.
              
              (f) The Coast Guard may assess additional charges to anyone to recover collection and enforcement costs associated with delinquent payments or failure to pay a fee. The Coast Guard will not provide credentialing services to a mariner who owes money for credentialing services previously provided.
              (g) Anyone who fails to pay a fee or charge established under this section is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $6,500 for each violation.
              (h) No-fee MMC for certain applicants. For the purpose of this section, a no-fee MMC applicant is a person who is a volunteer or a part- or full-time employee of an organization that is—
              (1) Charitable in nature;
              (2) Not for profit; and
              (3) Youth oriented.
              (i) Determination of eligibility. (1) An organization may submit a written request to U.S. Coast Guard National Maritime Center, 100 Forbes Drive, Martinsburg, WV 25404, in order to be considered an eligible organization under the criteria set forth in paragraph (h) of this section. With the written request, the organization must provide evidence of its status as a youth-oriented, not-for-profit, charitable organization.
              (2) The following organizations are accepted by the Coast Guard as meeting the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section and need not submit evidence of their status: Boy Scouts of America, Sea Explorer Association, Girl Scouts of the United States of America, and Young Men's Christian Association of the United States of America.
              (j) A letter from an organization determined eligible under paragraph (h) of this section must also accompany the person's MMC application to the Coast Guard. The letter must state that the purpose of the person's application is solely to further the conduct of the organization's maritime activities. The applicant will then be eligible under this section to obtain a no-fee MMC if other requirements for the MMC are met.
              (k) An MMC issued to a person under paragraph (h) of this section will be endorsed restricting its use to vessels owned or operated by the sponsoring organization.
              (l) The holder of a no-fee MMC issued under paragraph (h) of this section may have the restriction removed by paying the appropriate evaluation, examination, and issuance fees that would have otherwise applied.

              (a)(1) MMCs with officer Endorsements. Only individuals with valid U.S. citizenship may apply for officer endorsements, except individuals applying for endorsements as operators of uninspected passenger vessels authorizing service on undocumented vessels in accordance with § 11.201(d) of this subchapter.
              (2) All other MMCs. All other applicants, except as noted in § 12.809 of this subchapter, must be either:

              (c) TSA and the Coast Guard may reject any evidence of citizenship that is not believed to be authentic. Acceptable evidence of citizenship may be an original or a copy certified as true by the agency responsible for issuing the document of the following:
              (1) If the individual is applying for an officer endorsement (with the exception of those applying for an MMC endorsed only as Operator of an Uninspected Passenger Vehicle (OUPV) of an undocumented vessel), the individual must provide an original of any one of the following documents:

              (i) Certified copy of a birth certificate, issued by a State, county, municipality or outlying possession of the U.S. bearing an official seal;
              
              (ii) U.S. passport (expired or unexpired);

              (2) If the individual is applying for a rating endorsement and they hold one of the documents listed in paragraph (c)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, these documents are also acceptable as evidence of citizenship. If the individual does not hold any one of those documents listed in paragraph (c)(1)(i) through (v), the individual must provide an original unexpired foreign passport and an original of any one of the following documents:
              (i) Permanent resident card (form I-551) issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services bearing the certification that the alien was admitted to the United States as an immigrant,
              (ii) A declaration of intention to become a citizen of the United States issued by a naturalization court; or
              (iii) A certificate issued by the consular representative of the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject.
              (3) If the individual is the holder of or applying for a rating endorsement and the individual does not hold any of the documents listed in paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section, proof of enrollment in the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) in the form of an original letter from the USMMA, signed by the Superintendent attesting to the individual's enrollment along with an unexpired foreign passport issued by the government of the country in which the alien is a citizen or subject, with a valid U.S. visa affixed to the passport, will be acceptable evidence of lawful status in the United States.
              (4) If the individual is applying for an MMC endorsed only as OUPV of an undocumented vessel, the individual must provide an original of any one of the documents enumerated in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (v) or (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, or proof of acceptable alien status as provided in 49 CFR 1572.105.

              Modification or removal of limitations or scope.
              (a) If the Coast Guard is satisfied by the documentary evidence submitted that an applicant is entitled by experience, training, and knowledge to an endorsement or increase in the scope of any MMC held, any limitations that were previously placed upon the MMC by the Coast Guard may be changed or removed. Such an increase in scope may include a change in horsepower or tonnage limitations, or geographic route restrictions.
              (b) Modifications or removal of limitations or scope to MMC endorsement(s) under this section will not change the expiration date of the mariner's MMC unless the applicant renews all endorsements that would appear on the MMC under § 10.227 of this part.
              (c) A complete application for modification or removal of limitation of scope must contain the following:
              (1) A completed signed application;

              (4) The appropriate fee as set forth in § 10.219 of this part; and

              (5) Any uncanceled MMD, MMC, license, STCW endorsement, or COR held by the applicant. If one or more of these credentials are still valid at the time of application, a photocopy, front and back of all pages, and all attachments, will satisfy this requirement. If the applicant submits a photocopy, upon the issuance of the new MMC, the applicant must surrender the old, original credential to the Coast Guard. If requested in writing at the time of submission, the old MMD, MMC, license, COR, or STCW endorsement may be returned to the applicant after cancellation.
              (d) No limitation on any endorsement may be changed before the applicant has made up any deficiency in the experience prescribed for the endorsement or endorsement desired and passed any necessary examination.

An oath may be administered by any Coast Guard-designated individual or any person legally permitted to administer oaths in the jurisdiction where the person taking the oath resides. An oath administered at a location other than the Coast Guard must be verified in writing by the administering official and submitted to the same Regional Examination Center (REC) where the applicant applied for his or her MMC. This oath remains binding for any subsequently issued MMC and endorsements added to the MMC, unless specifically renounced in writing.

              (b) A credential may be renewed at any time during its validity and for 1 year after expiration.
              (c) No credential will be renewed if it has been suspended without probation or revoked as a result of action under part 5 of this chapter or if facts that would render a renewal improper have come to the attention of the Coast Guard.
              (d) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, a complete application for renewal must contain the following:
              (1) A completed, signed application.

              (4) Any uncanceled MMD, MMC, license, STCW endorsement, Certificate of Registry (COR), or Document of Continuity held by the applicant. If one or more of these credentials are still valid at the time of application, a photocopy—front, back, and all attachments—will satisfy this requirement.
              (5) Evidence of having passed a chemical test for dangerous drugs or of qualifying for an exemption from testing in § 16.220 of this subchapter.
              (6) Applicants seeking a national endorsement must either hold an unexpired medical certificate or submit a medical certificate application.
              (7) Consent to a Coast Guard check of the NDR for offenses described in section 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the National Driver Register Act of 1982, as amended.

              (v) Provide evidence of being a qualified instructor who has taught a Coast Guard-approved or -accepted course relevant to the endorsement or credential being applied for, at least twice within the past 5 years, therefore meeting the standards needed to receive a course completion certificate for that course.
              (2) The qualification requirements for renewal of radar observer endorsement as contained in § 11.480 of this subchapter.
              (3) Additional qualification requirements for renewal of an officer endorsement as first-class pilot as contained in § 11.713 of this subchapter.
              (4) An applicant for renewal of a radio officer's endorsement must, in addition to meeting the requirements of this section, present a copy of a currently valid license as first- or second-class radiotelegraph operator issued by the Federal Communications Commission.
              (5) An applicant for renewal of an endorsement as medical doctor or professional nurse must, in addition to meeting the requirements of this section, present evidence that he or she holds a currently valid, appropriate license as physician, surgeon, or registered nurse issued under the authority of a State or territory of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia. Any such renewal will retain the limitations placed upon the medical license by the issuing body. There are no professional requirements for renewal of an endorsement as marine physician assistant or hospital corpsman.

              (6) An applicant for renewal of an endorsement as master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels, in addition to the other requirements in this paragraph, must also submit satisfactory evidence of—
              (i) Having completed a practical demonstration of maneuvering and handling a towing vessel to the satisfaction of a designated examiner; or
              (ii) Ongoing participation in training and drills during the validity of the license or MMC being renewed.
              (7) An applicant seeking to renew a tankerman endorsement must meet the additional requirements listed in § 13.120 of this subchapter.

              (vii) Student observer.
              (viii) Apprentice engineer.
              (ix) Apprentice mate (issued under part 12 of this subchapter).
              (x) Person in charge of medical care.
              (xi) Medical first-aid provider.
              (xii) GMDSS at-sea maintainer.
              (xiii) GMDSS operator.
              (f) Except as otherwise provided, each candidate for a renewal of an STCW endorsement must meet the applicable requirements of part 11, subpart C, and/or part 12, subpart F.
              (g) Document of Continuity. (1) Applicants for renewal of national endorsements, who are unwilling or otherwise unable to meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, including but not limited to the medical and physical standards of subpart C of this part, suitability standards of § 10.211 of this part, drug tests, professional requirements, and TWIC, may apply for a Document of Continuity issued by the Coast Guard. Documents of Continuity do not expire and are issued solely to maintain an individual's eligibility for renewal. A Document of Continuity does not entitle an individual to serve as a merchant mariner. A holder of a Document of Continuity may obtain a properly endorsed, valid MMC at any time by satisfying the requirements for renewal as provided in paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section as applicable. When a valid MMC is issued to replace a previously held Document of Continuity, the previously issued Document of Continuity becomes void.
              (2) Applications for a Document of Continuity must include the following:
              (i) The endorsements to be placed into continuity.
              (ii) An application including a signed statement from the applicant attesting to an awareness of the limited purpose of the Document of Continuity, his or her inability to serve, and the requirements to obtain an MMC.
              (3) If not all MMC endorsements are to be converted into a Document of Continuity, a new MMC will be issued with the active endorsements. Once the new MMC and/or Document of Continuity is issued the previous MMC is no longer valid and must be returned to the Coast Guard.
              (4) STCW endorsements may not be placed in continuity. If an individual continues to maintain a valid MMC while placing specific national endorsements into continuity, those STCW endorsements associated with the national endorsements that were placed in continuity are no longer valid.
              (5) No credential expired beyond the 12-month administrative grace period in paragraph (h) of this section can be converted into a Document of Continuity.
              (6) A holder of a Document of Continuity may obtain a properly endorsed, valid MMC, including STCW endorsements, at any time by satisfying the requirements for renewal as provided in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section.
              (h) Administrative grace period. A credential may be renewed up to 12 months after expiration. For a credential to be re-issued by the Coast Guard more than 12 months after its expiration, an applicant must comply with the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section. When an applicant's credential expires during a time of service with the Armed Forces and there is no reasonable opportunity for renewal, including by mail, this period may be extended. The period of military service following the date of expiration which precluded renewal may be added to the 12-month grace period. The 12-month grace period and any extensions do not affect the expiration date of the credential. A license, MMD, COR, STCW endorsement, MMC, and any endorsements thereon, are not valid for use after the expiration date.
              (i) Re-issuance of expired credentials. (1) If an applicant applies for re-issuance of an endorsement as deck officer, engineer officer, or qualified rating more than 12 months after its expiration, instead of the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, the applicant must demonstrate continued professional knowledge by completing a course approved for this purpose, or by passing the complete examination for original issue of the endorsement. The examination may be oral-assisted if the expired credential was awarded based on the results of an oral exam. The fees set forth in § 10.219 of this part apply to these examinations. In the case of an expired radio officer's endorsement, the endorsement may be issued upon presentation of a valid first- or second-class radiotelegraph operator license issued by the Federal Communications Commission.
              (2) An endorsement for chief purser, purser, senior assistant purser, junior assistant purser, hospital corpsman, marine physician assistant, medical doctor, or professional nurse that has been expired for more than 12 months must be renewed in the same way as a current endorsement of that type. There are no additional requirements for re-issuing endorsements for chief purser, purser, senior assistant purser, junior assistant purser, hospital corpsman, marine physician assistant, medical doctor, or professional nurse that have been expired for more than 12 months.
              (3) Applicants applying for re-issuance of an endorsement as master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels more than 12 months after expiration of the previous endorsement must complete the practical demonstration of maneuvering and handling a towing vessel required under (e)(6)(i) of this section.
              (4) Applicants applying for re-issuance of an endorsement as any tankerman rating more than 12 months after expiration of the previous endorsement must meet the requirements in § 13.117 of this subchapter.

              § 10.229
              Replacement of lost merchant mariner credentials.
              (a) Upon request and without examination, a mariner may be issued a duplicate credential and medical certificate after submitting an application with an affidavit describing the circumstances of the loss. The Coast Guard will only issue the duplicate credential, MMC and/or medical certificate, after confirming the validity of the mariner's credentials and the validity of the mariner's TWIC.
              (b) The duplicate credential will have the same authority, wording, and expiration date as the lost credential.
              (c) If a person loses a credential by shipwreck or other casualty, a duplicate credential will be issued free of charge. The term “other casualty” includes any damage to a ship caused by collision, explosion, tornado, wreck, flooding, beaching, grounding, or fire; or personal loss associated with a federally declared natural disaster.
              (d) If a person loses a credential by means other than those noted in paragraph (c) of this section and applies for a duplicate, the appropriate fee set out in § 10.219 of this part must be paid.
              (e) No application from an alien for a duplicate credential will be accepted unless the alien complies with the requirements of § 10.221 of this part.
              (f) Applications for duplicate credentials will not be subject to a criminal record review.

              § 10.231
              Requirements for raises of grade or new endorsements.
              (a) This section applies to applicants who already hold a valid credential and want to make either of the following transactions:
              (1) Add a new endorsement.
              (2) Obtain a raise of grade of an existing endorsement.

              (b) If an applicant for new endorsement or raise of grade meets the renewal requirements under § 10.227 of this subpart for every endorsement listed on the MMC and requests renewal, the applicant will receive a credential valid for 5 years. When an applicant does not meet the renewal requirements for every endorsement held, the applicant's new endorsement will be issued with the expiration date that is the same as the current MMC.
              (c) A complete application for a new endorsement or raise of grade must contain the following:
              (1) A completed, signed application.
              (2) Proof that the mariner either holds a valid TWIC or has applied for a TWIC.
              (3) All supplementary materials required to show that the mariner meets the mandatory requirements for the new endorsements sought as follows:
              (i) The mandatory requirements for officer endorsements as contained in part 11 of this subchapter and paragraph (d) of this section.
              (ii) The mandatory requirements for rating endorsements as contained in part 12 of this subchapter.
              (iii) The mandatory requirements for tankerman rating endorsements are contained in part 13 of this subchapter.
              (iv) The mandatory requirements for STCW endorsements as contained in parts 11, 12, and 13 of this subchapter.
              (4) The appropriate fee as contained in § 10.219 of this part.
              (5) Any uncanceled MMD, MMC, license, STCW endorsement, or COR held by the applicant. If one or more of these credentials are still valid at the time of application, a photocopy—front, back, and all attachments—will satisfy this requirement.
              (6) Applicants for the following endorsements must produce evidence of having passed a chemical test for dangerous drugs or of qualifying for an exemption from testing in § 16.220 of this subchapter:
              (i) Any officer endorsement.
              (ii) The first endorsement as able seaman, lifeboatman, lifeboatman-limited, qualified member of the engine department, or tankerman.
              (7) Where sea service is required, documentary evidence in accordance with § 10.232 of this part.
              (8) Applicants seeking a new endorsement must either hold an unexpired medical certificate or submit a medical certificate application.
              (9) Consent to a Coast Guard check for offenses described in section 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the National Driver Register Act of 1982, as amended.
              (d) Additional requirements for an applicant seeking a raise of grade of an officer endorsement are as follows:
              (1) Sea service acquired before the issuance of an officer endorsement is generally not accepted as any part of the service required for a raise of grade of that endorsement. However, service acquired before issuance of an officer endorsement will be accepted for certain crossovers, endorsements, or increases in scope of an MMC, as appropriate. In the limited tonnage categories for deck officers, total accumulated service is a necessary criterion for most raises of grade; therefore, service acquired before the issuance of such officer endorsements will be accepted.
              (2) An applicant remains eligible for a raise of grade while on probation as a result of action under part 5 of this chapter. A raise of grade issued to a person on probation will be subject to the same probationary conditions imposed against his or her other credentials. The offense for which he or she was placed on probation will be considered on the merits of the case in determining fitness to hold the endorsement applied for. No applicant will be examined for a raise of grade during any period when a suspension without probation or a revocation imposed under part 5 of this chapter is effective against his or her credential or while an appeal from these actions is pending.
              (3) Professional examination. (i) When the Coast Guard finds an applicant's experience and training for raise of grade is satisfactory, and the applicant is eligible in all other respects, the Coast Guard will authorize a professional examination.
              (ii) Oral-assisted examinations may be administered in accordance with § 11.201(j) of this subchapter.
              (iii) The general instructions for administration of examinations and the lists of subjects for all endorsements are found in part 11, subpart I; part 12, subpart E; and part 13, subpart A of this subchapter.

              § 10.232
              Sea service.
              (a) Documenting sea service. (1) Sea service may be documented in various forms such as certificates of discharge, pilotage service and billing forms, and service letters or other official documents from marine companies signed by the owner, operator, master, or chief engineer of the vessel. The Coast Guard must be satisfied as to the authenticity and acceptability of all evidence of experience or training presented.
              (2) Documentary evidence produced by the applicant, unless in the form of a Certificate of Discharge conforming to § 14.307 of this subchapter, must contain all of the following information:
              (i) Vessel name(s) and official numbers listed on the registration, certificate, or document issued.
              (ii) Gross tonnage of the vessel.
              (iii) Propulsion power and mode of propulsion of the vessel.
              (iv) The amount and nature (e.g. chief mate, assistant engineer, etc.) of the applicant's experience.
              (v) Applicable dates of service for each vessel, and the ports or terminals if applicable.
              (vi) The routes upon which the experience was acquired.
              (vii) For those seeking to renew a radar observer endorsement, whether the vessel is equipped with radar and if the mariner served in a position that routinely uses radar for navigation and collision avoidance purposes.
              (viii) For those seeking service credit on towing vessels in accordance with § 11.211(e) of this subchapter, the aggregate tonnage of the tug and barges during the mariner's service.
              (ix) Any other information necessary to determine the applicability of STCW to the vessel.
              (x) Whether the vessel is manned and equipped in accordance with SOLAS.
              (xi) Where required for an officer endorsement, time served as bridge watchkeeping or engine watchkeeping duties under the supervision of a qualified officer.
              (3) An MMC endorsement, in certain cases, may be considered as satisfactory evidence of any qualifying experience for obtaining other endorsements.
              (4) For service on vessels of less than 200 GRT, owners of vessels may attest to their own service and provide proof of ownership. Those who do not own a vessel must obtain letters or other evidence from licensed personnel or the owners of the vessels listed.
              (5) If the required sea service is associated with watchkeeping functions and the performance of duties, as required in §§ 11.323, 11.329, and 11.333, the service must be documented as having been carried out under the direct supervision of the appropriate person. If the required sea service is associated with the performance of duties, as required in §§ 11.470, 11.472, and 11.474, the service must be documented as having been carried out under the supervision of the appropriate person.
              (6) An applicant who has been acting as a pilot may submit a letter from a pilot's association attesting to the applicant's sea service. For those pilots seeking to renew a radar observer endorsement, the association's letter should indicate that the vessels piloted were equipped with radar, and that radar was used by the pilot for navigation and collision avoidance purposes. Pilots not part of an association may submit other relevant records indicating service, such as billing forms. For a raise-of-grade, pilots must comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (b) Service toward an oceans, near-coastal, or STCW endorsement will be credited as follows:
              (1) Service on the Great Lakes will be credited on a day-for-day basis up to 100 percent of the total required service.
              (2) Service on inland waters, other than Great Lakes, that are navigable waters of the United States, will be credited on a day-for-day basis for up to 50 percent of the total required service.

              (3) Service on vessels to which STCW applies, whether inland or coastwise, will be credited on a day-for-day basis. For establishing credit for sea service, the waters of the Inside Passage between Puget Sound and Cape Spencer, Alaska will be credited for a near-coastal and STCW endorsement.
              
              (c) Service toward a near-coastal or a Great Lakes endorsement will be credited on a day-for-day basis and in accordance with the individual requirements for the specific credential.
              (d) Sea service as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States and civilian service on vessels owned by the United States as required experience. (1) Sea service as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States will be accepted as required experience for an original, raise of grade, renewal, or increase in scope of all endorsements. In most cases, military sea service will have been performed upon ocean waters; however, inland service, as may be the case on smaller vessels, will be credited in the same manner as conventional evaluations. The applicant must submit an official transcript of sea service or history of assignments as verification of the service claimed when the application is submitted. A DD-214 is not acceptable evidence of sea service. The applicant must also provide the Coast Guard with other necessary information as to tonnage, routes, propulsion power, percentage of time underway, and assigned duties upon the vessels on which he or she served. Such service will be evaluated by the Coast Guard for a determination of its equivalence to sea service acquired on merchant vessels and the appropriate grade, class, and limit of endorsement for which the applicant is eligible. Normally, 60 percent of the total time onboard is considered equivalent underway service; however, the periods of operation of each vessel may be evaluated separately. In order to be eligible for a master's or chief engineer's unlimited endorsement, the applicant must have acquired military service in the capacity of commanding officer or engineer officer, respectively.
              (2) Applicants for management-level, operational-level or support-level STCW endorsements must demonstrate competence in accordance with part 11, subpart C; part 12, subpart F; and part 13, subpart F of this subchapter.
              (3) Service in deck ratings on military vessels such as seaman apprentice, seaman, boatswain's mate, quartermaster, or Radarman/Operations Specialist are considered deck service for the purposes of this part. Service in other ratings may be considered if the applicant establishes that his or her duties required a watchstanding presence on or about the bridge of a vessel. Service in engineer ratings on military vessels such as fireman apprentice, fireman, engineman, machinists mate, machinery technician, or boiler tender are considered engineer service for the purposes of this part. There are also other ratings such as electrician, hull technician, or damage controlman, which may be credited when the applicant establishes that his or her duties required watchstanding duties in an operating engine room.
              (4) In addition to service on vessels that get underway regularly, members of the Armed Forces may obtain creditable service for assignment to vessels that get underway infrequently, such as tenders and repair vessels. Normally, a 25-percent factor is applied to these time periods. This experience can be equated with general shipboard familiarity, training, ship's business, and other related duties.
              (5) Sea service obtained on submarines is creditable, as if it were surface vessel service, for deck and engineer officer and qualified ratings endorsements under the provision of paragraph (a) of this section. For application for deck officer and qualified ratings endorsements, submarine service may be creditable if at least 25 percent of all service submitted for the endorsement was obtained on surface vessels (e.g. if 4 years' total service were submitted for an original officer endorsement, at least 1 year must have been obtained on surface craft in order for the submarine service to be eligible for evaluation).
              (6) Service gained in a civilian capacity as commanding officer, master, mate, engineer, or pilot, etc., of any vessel owned and operated by the United States, in any service in which a license or officer endorsement as master, mate, engineer, or pilot was not required at the time of such service, will be evaluated by the Coast Guard for a determination of equivalence.
              (e) Sea service on vessels that do not get underway. This requirement applies to service obtained on vessels mandated by the Certificate of Inspection (COI) which are in operation but do not get underway or occasionally get underway for short voyages. Service while the vessel is not underway must be credited as follows:
              (1) Engineering department. Service may be credited day-for-day for up to 50 percent of the service credit for renewal, raise of grade, and original issue for each day the engineering plant is operational.
              (2) Deck department. Service may be credited as follows:
              (i) Original issue and raise of grade. Service is creditable on a 3-for-1 basis (12 months of experience equals 4 months of creditable service) for up to 6 months of service credit.
              (ii) Renewal. Service in any capacity in the deck department is creditable as closely related service under § 10.227(e)(1)(iv). When submitted in combination with underway service, service is creditable on a 3-for-1 basis (12 months of experience equals 4 months of creditable service) for up to 6 months of service credit.
              (f) Foreign sea service. (1) Experience and service acquired on foreign vessels is creditable for establishing eligibility for an original or renewal of an officer, rating, or STCW endorsement, subject to evaluation by the Coast Guard to determine that it is a fair and reasonable equivalent to service acquired on merchant vessels of the United States with respect to grade, tonnage, horsepower, waters, and operating conditions. This experience and service is also creditable to meet recency requirements.
              (2) Experience and service acquired on foreign vessels while holding a valid U.S. endorsement is creditable for establishing eligibility for a raise of grade of an officer, rating, or STCW endorsement, subject to evaluation as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. This experience and service is also creditable to meet recency requirements.
              (3) An applicant who has obtained qualifying experience on foreign vessels must submit satisfactory documentary evidence of such service (including any necessary official translation to the English language) in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.
              (g) Closely related service. The Coast Guard may accept evidence of employment in a position closely related to the operation, construction, or repair of vessels (either deck or engineer as appropriate) as meeting the sea service requirements for renewal under § 10.227(e)(1)(iv). Service as port engineer, port captain, shipyard superintendent, qualified instructor, or similar related service may be creditable for service for raise of grade of an engineer or deck officer endorsement; however, it may not be used for obtaining an original management-level endorsement. The service is creditable as follows:
              (1) Port engineer, port captain or shipyard superintendent experience is creditable on a 3-for-1 basis for a raise of grade (e.g., 12 months of experience equals 4 months of creditable service). For a raise-of-grade, this credit is limited to 6 months of service.
              (2) Service as a qualified instructor in a Coast Guard approved course or a training program is creditable on a 2-for-1 basis for a raise of grade (e.g., 12 months of experience equals 6 months of creditable service). For a raise-of-grade, this credit is limited to 6 months of service.
              (h) Day. (1) Except as noted otherwise, for the purpose of calculating service in this subchapter, a day is equal to 8 hours of watchstanding or day-working not to include overtime.
              (2) On vessels authorized by 46 U.S.C. 8104 and 46 CFR 15.705, to operate a two-watch system, a 12-hour working day may be creditable as 11/2 days of service.
              (3) On vessels of less than 100 GRT, a day is considered as 8 hours unless the Coast Guard determines that the vessel's operating schedule makes this criterion inappropriate; in no case will this period be less than 4 hours.
              (4) When computing service on MODUs for any endorsement, a day of MODU service must be a minimum of 4 hours, and no additional credit is received for periods served over 8 hours.
              (5) For cadet service on a training ship furnished by the Maritime Administration under 46 CFR 310.4, a day may be creditable as 11/2 days of service.
              (i) Tonnage equivalency. For the purpose of parts 10, 11 and 12, 200 GRT will be considered equivalent to 500 GT, and 1,600 GRT will be considered equivalent to 3,000 GT.

              § 10.233
              Obligations of the holder of a merchant mariner credential.
              (a) The holder of a credential may not voluntarily part with it or place it beyond his or her personal control by pledging or depositing it with any other person, except as required by regulation or as necessary to safeguard the credential. If the holder violates this section, the Coast Guard may pursue suspension or revocation of the license, MMD, COR, or MMC under the provisions of part 5 of this chapter.
              (b) Whenever a mariner loses a credential, he or she must immediately report the loss to the Coast Guard. The report must be made in writing, giving the facts incident to its loss.
              (c) Invalid credentials must be returned to the Coast Guard. Upon written request, the Coast Guard will return the cancelled credential to the mariner.
            
            
              § 10.235
              Suspension or revocation of merchant mariner credentials.
              (a) Any MMC or endorsement is subject to suspension or revocation on the same grounds, in the same manner, and with like procedure as provided in 46 U.S.C. chapter 77.
              (b) When any individual's credential is revoked, it is no longer valid for any purpose, and any MMC subsequently requested must be applied for as an original following the procedures of §§ 5.901-5.905 of this subchapter. When an endorsement on an individual's MMC is revoked, it is no longer valid, and any endorsement of the same type subsequently requested must be applied for as an original following the procedures of §§ 5.901-5.905 of this subchapter. When an officer's endorsement is revoked, the Coast Guard will issue an MMC containing any rating endorsement for which the holder is qualified.
              (c) An applicant who has had a TWIC, credential, or endorsement revoked, and who is applying for a subsequent MMC or endorsement, must state in his or her application the date of revocation, the serial number of the document revoked, and the type of document or endorsement revoked.
              (d) A person whose credential or endorsement has been revoked or suspended without probation may not be issued a replacement credential or endorsement without approval of the Commandant. If a mariner has multiple endorsements and one or more, but not all, of those endorsements are suspended or revoked, he or she will be issued, without payment of a fee, a replacement MMC reflecting those endorsements for which the mariner remains qualified.
              (e) When a credential or endorsement that is about to expire has been suspended, without probation, the renewal of the credential or endorsement will be withheld until expiration of the suspension period.
              (f) When applying for an original endorsement on an MMC, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, an individual's existing service and training may be considered by the Coast Guard when determining the grade of the endorsement to be issued.
              (g) An applicant for renewal or return of a credential with endorsement as master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels whose most recent credential has been suspended or revoked by an administrative law judge for incompetence must complete the practical demonstration required under § 10.227(e)(6)(i) of this subpart.
              (h) If the Coast Guard is advised by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) that a mariner has either been denied a TWIC or their TWIC has been revoked, the Coast Guard may initiate suspension and revocation action against the mariner's MMC, license, MMD, and COR under 46 U.S.C. 7702 and 7703. During the subsequent suspension and revocation proceeding, the TSA decision to deny issuance of, or to revoke, a mariner's TWIC will not be subject to review, and the mariner's failure to hold a TWIC will be treated by the Coast Guard as proof that the mariner is not eligible for an MMC, license, MMD or COR.

              (i) A mariner that has either been denied issuance of a TWIC or whose TWIC has been revoked for a reason, other than administrative reasons (e.g., being lost or stolen, not functioning, or having a misspelling) will be deemed ineligible for an MMC, license, MMD or COR.

              (a) If the Coast Guard refuses to grant an applicant an MMC, medical certificate, or endorsement it will provide, a written statement listing the reason(s) for denial.
              (b) Any person directly affected by a decision or action taken under this subchapter, by or on behalf of the Coast Guard, may appeal under the provisions of subpart 1.03 of part 1 of this chapter.
              (c) The Coast Guard will not review decisions made by the Transportation Security Administration to suspend, revoke, or deny a mariner's TWIC.

              § 10.301
              General requirements.
              (a) The Coast Guard will issue a medical certificate to a mariner meeting the medical and physical standards for merchant mariners. The medical certificate will be issued for various periods of time based upon the endorsements the mariner holds. The Coast Guard will review all information provided and will determine whether—
              (1) The applicant is physically and medically qualified for the medical certificate without any limitations, waivers and/or other conditions;
              (2) The applicant is physically and medically qualified for the medical certificate with limitations and/or other conditions as specified by the Coast Guard;
              (3) For an applicant who does not possess the vision, hearing, or general physical condition necessary, a medical certificate may be issued with appropriate limitations, waivers and/or other conditions as specified by the Coast Guard;
              (4) Additional information is necessary to determine if the applicant is physically and/or medically qualified for the medical certificate. The Coast Guard will request additional information from the applicant. The Coast Guard may hold the package pending receipt of that information before the package and/or application is denied; or
              (5) The applicant is not physically and/or medically qualified for the medical certificate. The application for a medical certificate will be denied by the Coast Guard.
              (b) Except as otherwise noted, medical certificates will be issued for the following periods of time:
              (1) All persons employed or engaged onboard vessels to which STCW applies will be issued a medical certificate valid for 2 years unless the mariner is under the age of 18, in which case the maximum period of validity will be 1 year.
              (2) Medical certificates issued to a mariner who is serving as a first-class pilot, or acting as a pilot under § 15.812 of this subchapter, will be issued for a maximum period of 2 years.
              (3) Medical certificates issued to all other mariners will be issued for a maximum period of 5 years.
              (4) Applicants seeking additional MMC endorsements holding a current medical certificate are not required to submit a new medical physical exam if their existing medical certification meets all of the requirements of this section for the endorsement sought.
              (c) Applicants holding no endorsement other than a staff officer endorsement need not meet the medical and physical requirements of this section.
            
            
              § 10.302
              Medical and physical requirements.
              (a) To qualify for a medical certificate, a mariner must provide evidence of meeting the medical and physical standards in this section on a CG-719-K or CG-719-K/E, as appropriate. The Coast Guard retains final authority for determining whether a mariner is medically and physically qualified. Columns 2 through 5 of Table 1 to paragraph (a) of this section provide the specific exam, test, or demonstrations required to obtain the corresponding credential listed in column 1. Further clarifications of the requirements contained in the table are found throughout this subpart.

              (b) Any required test, exam, or demonstration must have been performed, witnessed, or reviewed by a licensed medical doctor, licensed physician assistant, licensed nurse practitioner, or a designated medical examiner. All licensed medical practitioners must hold a valid license issued in the United States. Medical examinations for Great Lakes Pilots must be conducted by a licensed medical doctor in accordance with the physical exam requirements in 46 CFR 402.210.

              § 10.303
              Medical waivers, limitations, and restrictions.
              (a) The Coast Guard may grant a waiver if, after review of all relevant supporting medical documents and consultation with the examining physician, as needed, an applicant does not possess the vision, hearing, or general physical condition necessary; and extenuating circumstances warrant special consideration. An applicant may submit to the Coast Guard additional correspondence, records, and reports in support of a waiver. In this regard, recommendations from agencies of the Federal Government operating government vessels, as well as owners and operators of private vessels, made on behalf of their employees, will be given full consideration.
              (b) In general, medical waivers are approved when an applicant does not meet the applicable medical standards, but objective medical evidence indicates that the condition is sufficiently controlled and the effects of medication pose no significant risk to maritime and public safety. The Coast Guard retains final authority for the issuance of medical waivers.
              (c) Medical waivers may be granted with specific conditions to which the applicant must adhere, such as more frequent monitoring of the medical conditions, submission of medical exams and/or tests at varying intervals to track the ongoing status of the medical condition, or operational limitations in the manner the mariner may serve under the MMC.
              (d) The Coast Guard may place an operational limitation on medical and physical conditions. Any operational limitations will be reflected in the medical certificate.
              (e) The Coast Guard may place a restriction on a medical certificate based upon medical and physical conditions of an applicant. Any restriction will be reflected on the medical certificate and may include restriction of route or trade.
            
            
              § 10.304
              General medical exam.

              (a) The general medical exam must be documented and of such scope to ensure that there are no conditions that pose significant risk of sudden incapacitation or debilitating complication. This exam must also document any condition requiring medication that impairs cognitive ability, judgment, or reaction time. The Coast Guard will provide guidance on the conduct of general medical exams. Examiners should be familiar with the content and recommended medical evaluation data compiled in the medical guidelines.
              (b) Food handlers are not required to submit to a general medical exam, but must obtain a statement from a licensed physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner attesting that they are free of communicable diseases that pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.
              (c) Demonstration of physical ability. (1) A demonstration of physical ability is required only if—
              (i) The medical practitioner conducting the general medical exam is concerned that an applicant's physical ability may impact maritime safety; or
              (ii) Table 1 to § 10.302(a) of this subpart shows that the mariner must pass a demonstration of physical ability.
              (2) For an applicant to satisfactorily pass a demonstration of physical ability, the examiner must be satisfied that the applicant—
              (i) Has no disturbance in the sense of balance;
              (ii) Is able, without assistance, to climb up and down vertical ladders and inclined stairs;
              (iii) Is able, without assistance, to step over a door sill or coaming;
              (iv) Is able to move through a restricted opening of 24-by-24 inches (61-by-61 centimeters);
              (v) Is able to grasp, lift, and manipulate various common shipboard tools, move hands and arms to open and close valve wheels in vertical and horizontal directions, and rotate wrists to turn handles;
              (vi) Does not have any impairment or disease that could prevent normal movement and physical activities;
              (vii) Is able to stand and walk for extended periods of time;
              (viii) Does not have any impairment or disease that could prevent response to a visual or audible alarm; and
              (ix) Is capable of normal conversation.
              (3) Guidance on demonstration of physical ability is contained in the relevant Coast Guard guidance for the conduct of general medical exams.
              (d) Reports of medical and physical exams, demonstrations, and tests. These reports must be submitted within 12 months from the date signed by the licensed medical professional. When submitted with a complete application package, these reports remain valid for 12 months from the date the Coast Guard accepts a complete application.
            
            
              § 10.305
              Vision requirements.
              (a) Deck standard. (1) A mariner must have correctable vision to at least 20/40 in one eye and uncorrected vision of at least 20/200 in the same eye. The color sense must be determined to be satisfactory when tested by any of the following methods or an alternative test acceptable to the Coast Guard, without the use of color-sensing lenses:
              (i) Pseudoisochromatic Plates (Dvorine, 2nd Edition; AOC; revised edition or AOC-HRR; Ishihara 14-, 24- , or 38-;plate editions).
              (ii) Farnsworth Lantern.
              (iii) Titmus Vision Tester/OPTEC 2000.
              (iv) Optec 900.
              (v) Richmond Test, 2nd and 4th edition.
              (2) Applicants for an STCW endorsement must have correctable vision to at least 20/40 in both eyes and uncorrected vision of at least 20/200 in both eyes. A mariner who previously met these requirements and who suffers loss of vision in one eye after being issued an MMC is subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, as applicable. A mariner holding an MMC prior to January 1, 2017, must continue to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
              (b) Engineering, radio officer, tankerman, and MODU standard. A mariner must have correctable vision to at least 20/50 in one eye and uncorrected vision of at least 20/200 in the same eye and need only the ability to distinguish the colors red, green, blue, and yellow. The color sense must be determined to be satisfactory when tested by any color-vision test listed in paragraph (a) of this section, or an alternative test acceptable to the Coast Guard, without the use of color-sensing lenses. The Coast Guard will accept Farnsworth D-15 Hue Test as a color vision test to meet the requirements of this paragraph.
              (c) Vision waiver. Any applicant whose uncorrected vision does not meet the 20/200 standard and is correctable to listed standards above may be granted a medical waiver in accordance with § 10.303 of this subpart. If a vision waiver is granted, a limitation will be placed on his or her a medical certificate indicating the mariner may not serve under the authority of the endorsement unless corrective lenses are worn and spare lenses are carried onboard a vessel. Waivers are not normally granted to an applicant whose corrected vision in the better eye is not at least 20/40 for deck officers or 20/50 for engineer officers.
              (d) Vision operational limitation. If corrective lenses are required in order to meet the vision standards above, a mariner may not serve under the authority of the endorsement unless corrective lenses are worn and spare lenses are carried onboard a vessel. This operational limitation will be placed on his or her medical certificate.
              (e) Loss of vision. A mariner having lost vision in one eye must wait 6 months from the date of the vision loss before submitting any application, and must provide a statement of demonstrated ability on his or her medical examination.
              [USCG-2004-17914, 78 FR 77900, Dec. 24, 2013, as amended by USCG-2018-0874, 84 FR 30881, June 28, 2019]
            
            
              § 10.306
              Hearing requirements.
              (a) If the medical practitioner conducting the general medical exam has concerns that an applicant's ability to hear may impact maritime safety, the examining medical practitioner must refer the applicant to an audiologist or other hearing specialist to conduct an audiometer test and a speech discrimination test, as appropriate.
              (b) The audiometer test must include testing at the following thresholds: 500 Hz; 1,000 Hz; 2,000 Hz; and 3,000 Hz. The frequency responses for each ear must be averaged to determine the measure of an applicant's hearing ability. Applicants must demonstrate an unaided threshold of 30 decibels or less in at least one ear.
              (c) The functional speech discrimination test must be carried out at a level of 65 decibels. For issuance of an original MMC or endorsement the applicant must demonstrate functional speech discrimination of at least 90 percent. For renewal or raise of grade, the applicant must demonstrate functional speech discrimination of at least 80 percent.
              (d) Hearing waivers. An applicant who is unable to meet the hearing standards of the audiometer test, but who can pass the functional speech discrimination test; or who requires hearing aids to meet the hearing standards, may be eligible for a medical waiver in accordance with § 10.303 of this subpart.
              (e) Hearing operational limitation. If hearing aids are required in order to meet the hearing standards above, a mariner may not serve under the authority of the endorsement unless hearing aids are worn in the operational mode, and spare batteries are carried onboard a vessel. This operational limitation will be placed on his or her medical certificate.

              (xi) The number of students who were required to retake the entire course.

              (xii) The number of students who were required to retake a portion of the course;
              
              (7) Not significantly change its approved curriculum without approval from the NMC as specified in § 10.402(e) of this subpart;
              (8) Conduct an internal audit midway through the term of the course's approval and maintain the results of the audit for a period of not less than 5 years. The audit will evaluate whether—
              (i) Records are being maintained according to these regulations;
              (ii) The course is being presented in accordance with the approval letter; and
              (iii) Surveys from students indicate that the course is meeting their needs; and
              (9) At any time, allow the Coast Guard to—
              (i) Inspect its facilities, equipment, and records, including scholastic records;
              (ii) Conduct interviews and surveys of students to aid in course evaluation and improvement;
              (iii) Assign personnel to observe or participate in the course of instruction; and
              (iv) Supervise or administer the required examinations or practical demonstrations, including the substitution of an applicable Coast Guard examination in a course approved to substitute for a Coast Guard administered examination.

              § 11.101
              Purpose of regulations.
              (a) The purpose of this part is to provide—

              (1) A means of determining the qualifications an applicant must possess to be eligible for an officer endorsement as a staff officer, deck officer, engineer officer, pilot, or radio officer on merchant vessels, or for an endorsement to operate uninspected passenger vessels; and
              
              (2) A means of determining that an applicant is competent to serve as a master, chief mate, officer in charge of a navigational watch, chief engineer officer, second engineer officer (first assistant engineer), officer in charge of an engineering watch, designated duty engineer, or Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) radio operator, in accordance with the provisions of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended (the STCW Convention or STCW), and other laws, and to receive the appropriate endorsement as required by STCW.
              (b) With few exceptions, these regulations do not specify or restrict officer endorsements to particular types of service such as tankships, freight vessels, or passenger vessels. However, each officer credentialed under this part must become familiar with the relevant characteristics of a vessel prior to assuming his or her duties as required in the provisions of § 15.405 of this subchapter.
              (c) The regulations previously found in subpart C of this part that prescribe the requirements applicable to approved training courses, training for a particular officer endorsement, and training and assessment associated with meeting the standards of competence established by the STCW Convention have been moved to 46 CFR part 10, subpart C.

            Subpart B—General Requirements for Officer Endorsements
            
              § 11.201
              General requirements for national and STCW officer endorsements.
              (a) General. In addition to the requirements of part 10 of this subchapter, the applicant for an officer endorsement, whether original, renewal, duplicate, or raise of grade, must establish to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard that he or she possesses all the qualifications necessary (including but not limited to age, experience, character, physical health, citizenship, approved training, professional competence, and a test for dangerous drugs) before the Coast Guard will issue to him or her a merchant mariner credential (MMC). An applicant for any STCW endorsement must hold the appropriate national endorsement unless otherwise specified.
              (b) English language requirements. Except as provided in § 11.467(h) of this part, an applicant for an officer endorsement must demonstrate an ability to speak and understand English as found in the navigation rules, aids to navigation publications, emergency equipment instructions, machinery instructions, and radiotelephone communications instructions.
              (c) Experience and service. (1) Applicants for officer endorsements should refer to § 10.232 of this subchapter for information regarding requirements for documentation and proof of sea service.
              (2) An applicant for a national officer endorsement must have at least 3 months of required service on vessels of appropriate tonnage or horsepower within the 3 years immediately preceding the date of application.
              (3) No original officer endorsement may be issued to any naturalized citizen based on less experience in any grade or capacity than would have been required of a citizen of the United States by birth.
              (4) Experience and service acquired on foreign vessels is creditable for establishing eligibility for an officer endorsement, subject to evaluation by the Coast Guard to determine that it is a fair and reasonable equivalent to service acquired on merchant vessels of the United States, with respect to grade, tonnage, horsepower, waters, and operating conditions. An applicant who has obtained qualifying experience on foreign vessels must submit satisfactory documentary evidence of such service (including any necessary translation into English) in accordance with § 10.232 of this subchapter.
              (5) No applicant for an original officer endorsement who is a naturalized citizen and who has obtained experience on foreign vessels will be given an original officer endorsement in a grade higher than that upon which he or she has actually served while acting under the authority of a foreign credential.
              (6) Experience acquired while the applicant was less than 16 years of age is generally not creditable. Compelling circumstances and unique experiences acquired before the applicant reaches 16 years of age will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
              (d) Citizenship. No officer endorsement may be issued to any person who is not a citizen of the United States with the exception of operators of uninspected passenger vessels that are not documented under the laws of the United States.
              (e) Age. Except as specified in this paragraph, no officer endorsement may be issued to a person who has not attained the age of 21 years. The required evidence of age may be established using any of the items submitted to establish citizenship set out in 49 CFR 1572.17.
              (1) An endorsement may be granted to an applicant who has reached the age of 19 years as—
              (i) Master of near-coastal, Great Lakes and inland, or river vessels of 25-200 GRT;
              (ii) Third mate;
              (iii) Third assistant engineer;
              (iv) Mate of vessels of between 200 GRT and 1,600 GRT;
              (v) Ballast control operator (BCO);
              (vi) Assistant engineer (MODU);
              (vii) Assistant engineer of fishing industry vessels;
              (viii) Mate (pilot) of towing vessels;
              (ix) Radio officer;
              (x) Assistant engineer (limited); or
              (xi) Designated duty engineer of vessels of less than 4,000 HP/3,000 kW.
              (2) An endorsement may be granted to an applicant who has reached the age of 18 years as—
              (i) Limited master of near-coastal vessels of less than 100 GRT;
              (ii) Limited master of Great Lakes and inland vessels of less than 100 GRT;

              (iii) Mate of Great Lakes and inland vessels of 25-200 GRT;
              
              (iv) Mate of near-coastal vessels of 25-200 GRT;
              (v) Operator of uninspected passenger vessels (OUPV);
              (vi) Designated duty engineer of vessels of less than 1,000 HP/750 kW;
              (vii) Apprentice mate (steersman) of towing vessels;
              (viii) Officer in charge of a navigational watch (OICNW);
              (ix) Officer in charge of an engineering watch (OICEW); and
              (x) Electro-technical officer (ETO).
              (f) Physical examination. (1) Persons serving or intending to serve in the merchant marine service are encouraged to take the earliest opportunity to ascertain, through examination, whether their visual acuity, color vision, hearing, and general physical condition, are such as to qualify them for service in that profession. Any physical impairment or medical condition that would render an applicant incompetent to perform the ordinary duties required of an officer is cause for denial of an officer endorsement.
              (2) Applications for an original officer endorsement, raises of grade, and extensions of route, must be current and up to date with respect to service and the physical examination, as appropriate. Physical examinations and applications are valid for 12 months from the date the application is approved.
              (g) Character check. (1) An individual may apply for an original officer endorsement, or officer or STCW endorsement of a different type, while on probation as a result of administrative action under part 5 of this chapter. The offense for which the applicant was placed on probation will be considered in determining his or her fitness to hold the endorsement applied for. An officer or STCW endorsement issued to an applicant on probation will be subject to the same probationary conditions as were imposed against the applicant's other credential. An applicant may not take an examination for an officer or STCW endorsement during any period of time when a suspension without probation or a revocation is effective against the applicant's currently held license, merchant mariner document (MMD), or MMC, or while an appeal from these actions is pending.
              (2) If information about the applicant's habits of life and character is brought to the attention of the Coast Guard after an original license, certificate of registry, or officer endorsement has been issued, and if such information reasonably supports the conclusion that the applicant cannot be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of the license, certificate of registry, or officer endorsement issued, or indicates that the application for the license, certificate of registry, or officer endorsement was false or incomplete, the Coast Guard may notify the holder in writing that the license, certificate of registry, or officer endorsement is considered null and void, direct the holder to return the credential to the Coast Guard, and advise the holder that, upon return of the credential, the appeal procedures of § 10.237 of this subchapter apply.
              (h) Firefighting certificate. (1) Applicants for an original officer endorsement in the following categories must present a certificate of completion from a firefighting course of instruction that has been approved by the Coast Guard. The firefighting course must have been completed within the past 5 years, or if it was completed more than 5 years before the date of application, the applicant must provide evidence of maintaining the standard of competence in accordance with the firefighting requirements for the credential sought.
              (2) The following categories must meet the requirements for basic and advanced firefighting in Regulations VI/1 and VI/3 of the STCW Convention and Tables A-VI/1-2 and A-VI/3 of the STCW Code (both incorporated by reference, see § 11.102 of this part):
              (i) National officer endorsements as master or mate on seagoing vessels of 200 GRT or more.
              (ii) All national officer endorsements for master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels, except apprentice mate (steersman) of the vessels, on oceans.
              (iii) All national officer endorsements for MODUs.
              (iv) All national officer endorsements for engineers.
              (v) All national officer endorsements for OSVs.
              
              (vi) All STCW officer endorsements except GMDSS radio operator.
              (3) The following categories must meet the requirements for basic firefighting in Regulation VI/1 of the STCW Convention and Table A-VI/1-2 of the STCW Code:
              (i) Officer endorsement as master on vessels of less than 500 GT in ocean service.
              (ii) All officer endorsements for master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels, except apprentice mate (steersman) of towing vessels, in all services except oceans.
              (4) Applicants for a raise of grade of an officer endorsement who have not previously met the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section must do so.
              (i) First-aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) course certificates. All applicants for an original officer endorsement, except as provided in §§ 11.429, 11.456, and 11.467 of this part, must present to the Coast Guard—
              (1) Evidence of continued competency in STCW basic training in accordance with § 11.302 of this part or a certificate indicating completion not more than 1 year from the date of application of —
              (i) The American National Red Cross Standard First Aid course or American National Red Cross Community First Aid & Safety course; or
              (ii) A Coast Guard-approved first-aid course; and
              (2) A currently valid certificate of completion of a CPR course from either—
              (i) The American National Red Cross;
              (ii) The American Heart Association; or
              (iii) A Coast Guard-approved CPR course.
              (j) Professional examination. (1) When the Coast Guard finds the applicant's experience and training to be satisfactory, and the applicant is eligible in all other respects, the Coast Guard will authorize examination in accordance with the following requirements:
              (i) Except for an endorsement required by the STCW Convention, any applicant for a deck or engineer officer endorsement limited to vessels less than 200 GRT, or an officer endorsement limited to uninspected fishing industry vessels, may request an orally assisted examination instead of any written or other textual examination. If there are textual questions that the applicant has difficulty reading and understanding, the Coast Guard will offer the orally assisted examination. Each officer endorsement based on an orally assisted examination is limited to the specific route and type of vessel upon which the applicant obtained the majority of service.
              (ii) The general instructions for administration of examinations and the lists of subjects for all officer endorsements appear in subpart I of this part. The Coast Guard will place in the applicant's file a record indicating the subjects covered.
              (iii) An applicant enrolled in an approved comprehensive program of training, service, and assessment will be authorized for an examination not more than 6 months prior to completion of the comprehensive program, provided all sea service and assessments of competency are completed prior to the examination.
              (iv) The examination, whether administered orally or by other means, must be conducted only in the English language.
              (2) When the application has been approved for examination, the approval is valid for 1 year.
              (3) An examination is not required for a staff officer or radio officer endorsement.
              (k) Radar observer. Applicants for an endorsement as radar observer must present a certificate of completion from a radar observer course as required by § 11.480 of this part.
              (l) Restrictions. The Coast Guard may modify the service and examination requirements in this part to satisfy the unique qualification requirements of an applicant or distinct group of mariners. The Coast Guard may also lower the age requirement for OUPV applicants. The authority granted by an officer endorsement will be restricted to reflect any modifications made under the authority of this paragraph.

              § 11.211
              Creditable service and equivalents for national and STCW officer endorsements.
              (a) Applicants for officer endorsements should refer to § 10.232 of this subchapter for information regarding requirements for documentation and proof of sea service.
              (b) Service toward an oceans, near-coastal, or STCW endorsement will be credited as follows:
              (1) Service on the Great Lakes will be credited on a day-for-day basis up to 100 percent of the total required service.
              (2) Service on inland waters, other than Great Lakes, that are navigable waters of the United States, will be credited on a day-for-day basis for up to 50 percent of the total required service.
              (c) Service on mobile offshore drilling units. (1) MODU service is creditable for raise of grade of an officer endorsement. Evidence of 1 year of service on MODUs as mate or equivalent while holding an officer endorsement or license as third mate, or as engineering officer of the watch or equivalent while holding an officer endorsement or license as third assistant engineer, is acceptable for a raise of grade to second mate or second assistant engineer, respectively. However, any subsequent raises of grade of unlimited, non-restricted officer licenses or endorsements must include a minimum of 6 months of service on conventional vessels.
              (2) Service on MODUs maintaining station by means of dynamic positioning, may be credited as service on conventional vessels for any raise of grade; however, time more than 8 hours each day will not be credited.
              (3) A day of creditable MODU service must be a minimum of 4 hours, and no additional credit will be granted for periods of more than 8 hours.
              (4) Creditable MODU service excludes time spent ashore due to crew rotation.
              (d) Service on Articulated Tug Barges (ATBs) and Integrated Tug Barges (ITBs). Service on ATB or Dual Mode ITB units is creditable for an original deck officer endorsement or raise of grade of any deck officer endorsement. Service on an ATB or Dual Mode ITB with an aggregate tonnage of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more is creditable on a two-for-one basis (2 days experience equals 1 day of creditable service) for up to 50 percent of the total service on vessels of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more required for an unlimited officer endorsement. The remaining required service on vessels of more than 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT must be obtained on conventional vessels or Push Mode ITBs.
              (e) Service on towing vessels. Service as master or mate (pilot) on towing vessels, when the aggregate tonnage of the tug and barges is 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more, is creditable, using the aggregate tonnage, on a two-for-one basis (2 days experience equals 1 day of creditable service) for up to 50 percent of the total service on vessels of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more required for an unlimited officer endorsement. The remaining required service on vessels of more than 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT must be obtained on conventional vessels. This service must be documented as specified in § 10.232(a) of this subchapter.
              (f) Individuals obtaining sea service as part of an approved training curriculum pursuant to either § 11.407(a)(2) or § 11.516(a)(3) of this part must do so in the capacity of cadet (deck) or cadet (engine), as appropriate, notwithstanding any other rating endorsements the individual may hold or any other capacity in which the individual may have served.
              (g) Other experience. Other experience in a marine-related area, other than at sea, or sea service performed on unique vessels, will be evaluated by the Coast Guard for a determination of equivalence to traditional service.
              (h) Tonnage. When determining sea service credit for officer endorsement applicants under subpart D of this part, the tonnage of a vessel solely admeasured using the Convention measurement scheme under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 143 will be credited as Gross Register Tonnage. This paragraph does not apply to those vessels measured under the optional regulatory measurement provisions of 46 U.S.C. 14305.

              Examination procedures and denial of officer endorsements.
              (a) The examination fee set out in Table 1 to § 10.219(a) of this subchapter must be paid before the applicant may take the first examination section. If an applicant fails three or more sections of the examination, a complete re-examination must be taken. On the subsequent exam, if the applicant again fails three or more sections, at least 3 months must elapse before another complete examination is attempted, and a new examination fee is required. If an applicant fails one or two sections of an examination, the applicant may be retested twice on these sections during the next 3 months. If the applicant does not successfully complete these sections within the 3-month period, a complete re-examination must be taken at least 3 months from the date of the last retest, and a new examination fee is required. The 3-month retest period may be extended by the Coast Guard if the applicant presents evidence documenting sea time that prevented the taking of a retest during the 3-month period. The retest period may not be extended beyond 7 months from the initial examination. All examinations and retests must be completed within 1 year of approval for examination.
              (b) If the Coast Guard refuses to grant an applicant the endorsement applied for due to the applicant's failure to pass a required examination, the Coast Guard will provide the applicant with a written statement setting forth the portions of the examination that must be retaken and the date by which the examination must be completed.

            Subpart D—Professional Requirements for National Deck Officer Endorsements
            
              § 11.401
              Ocean and near-coastal national officer endorsements.
              (a) Subject to the provisions of §§ 11.464(e) and 11.465(b) of this subpart, any license or MMC endorsement for service as master or mate on ocean waters qualifies the mariner to serve in the same grade on any waters, except towing vessels upon western rivers subject to the limitations of the endorsement.
              (b) Subject to the provisions of §§ 11.464(e) and 11.465(b) of this subpart, any license or MMC endorsement issued for service as master or mate on near-coastal waters qualifies the mariner to serve in the same grade on Great Lakes and inland waters, except towing vessels upon western rivers subject to the limitations of the endorsement.
              (c) Near-coastal endorsements for unlimited tonnage require the same number of years of service as the ocean-unlimited endorsements. The primary differences in these endorsements are the nature of the service and the scope of the required training, examination, and assessment.
              (d) A master or mate on vessels of 200 GRT or more, and a master or mate on vessels under 200 GRT, may be endorsed for sail or auxiliary sail as appropriate. The applicant must present the equivalent total service required for conventional officer endorsements, including at least 1 year of deck experience on that specific type of vessel. For example, for an officer endorsement as master of vessels of less than 1,600 GRT endorsed for auxiliary sail, the applicant must meet the total experience requirements for the conventional officer endorsement, including time as mate, and the proper tonnage experience, including at least 1 year of deck service, on appropriately sized auxiliary sail vessels. For an endorsement to serve on vessels of less than 200 GRT, see the individual endorsement requirements.
              (e) Service toward an oceans, near-coastal or STCW endorsement will be credited as follows:
              (1) Service on the Great Lakes will be credited on a day-for-day basis.
              (2) Service on inland waters, other than Great Lakes, that are navigable waters of the United States, may be substituted for up to 50 percent of the total required service.
              (3) Service on vessels to which STCW applies, whether inland or coastwise, will be credited on a day-for-day basis.
            
            
              
              § 11.402
              Tonnage requirements for national ocean or near-coastal endorsements for vessels of 1,600 GRT or more.
              (a) To qualify for a national ocean or near-coastal endorsement for service on vessels of unlimited tonnage—
              (1) All the required experience must be obtained on vessels of 100 GRT or more; and
              (2) At least one-half of the required experience must be obtained on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more.
              (b) If an applicant for a national endorsement as master or mate of unlimited tonnage does not have the service on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a tonnage limitation will be placed on the MMC based on the applicant's qualifying experience. The endorsement will be limited to the maximum tonnage on which at least 25 percent of the required experience was obtained, or 150 percent of the maximum tonnage on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained, whichever is higher. However, the minimum tonnage limitation calculated according to this paragraph will be 2,000 GRT. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 GRT using the next higher figure when an intermediate tonnage is calculated. When the calculated limitation equals or exceeds 10,000 GRT, the applicant is issued an unlimited tonnage endorsement.
              (c) Tonnage limitations imposed under paragraph (b) of this section may be raised or removed in one of the following manners:
              (1) When the applicant provides evidence of 6 months of service on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more in the highest grade endorsed, all tonnage limitations will be removed.
              (2) When the applicant provides evidence of 6 months of service on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more in any capacity as an officer other than the highest grade for which he or she is endorsed, all tonnage limitations for the grade in which the service is performed will be removed and the next higher grade endorsement will be raised to the tonnage of the vessel on which the majority of the service was performed. The total cumulative service before and after issuance of the limited license or MMC officer endorsement may be considered in removing all tonnage limitations.
              (3) When the applicant has 12 months of service as able seaman on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more while holding a license or endorsement as third mate, all tonnage limitations on the third mate's license or MMC officer endorsement will be removed.
              (d) No applicant holding any national endorsement as master or mate of vessels of less than 1,600 GRT, less than 500 GRT, or less than 25-200 GRT may use the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section to increase the tonnages of his or her license or endorsement.

              (d) Because these officer endorsements authorize service on waters seaward of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) demarcation lines, as defined in 33 CFR part 80, the applicant must complete an examination on the COLREGS or the endorsement will exclude such waters.
              (e) To obtain a master or mate endorsement with a tonnage limit of 200 GRT or more, whether an original, raise of grade, or increase in the scope of authority, the applicant must meet the training requirements in § 11.201(h) and (i) of this part and successfully complete radar observer training in § 11.480 of this part.
              (f) Figure 11.430(f) illustrates the deck officer endorsement structure, including crossover points, for Great Lakes and inland waters service. The section numbers on the diagram refer to the specific requirements applicable.

The endorsement is limited to the maximum tonnage on which at least 25 percent of the required service was obtained or 150 percent of the maximum tonnage on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained, whichever is higher. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 GRT, using the next higher figure when an intermediate tonnage is calculated. An endorsement as master of uninspected fishing industry vessels authorizing service on vessels more than 1,600 GRT also requires 1 year as master, mate, or equivalent on vessels of 100 GRT or more.

              (ii) Six months of service as master on a vessel results in a limitation in that capacity equal to 150 percent of the tonnage of that vessel.
              (iii) Six months of service as master on vessels more than 1,600 GRT results in raising the limitation to 5,000 GRT.
              (iv) Six months of service as mate on vessels more than 1,600 GRT results in raising the limitation for master to the tonnage on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained.
              (v) Two years of service as a deckhand on a vessel while holding a license or MMC endorsement as master results in a limitation on the MMC equal to 150 percent of the tonnage of that vessel up to 5,000 GRT.
              (vi) One year of service as deckhand on a vessel while holding a license or MMC endorsement as master results in a limitation on the MMC equal to the tonnage of that vessel.
              (d) An applicant for an endorsement as mate of uninspected fishing industry vessels must have 3 years of total service on ocean or near-coastal routes. Service on Great Lakes or inland waters may substitute for up to 18 months of the required service.
              (1) To qualify for an endorsement of less than 500 GRT, at least 1 year of the required service must have been on vessels of 50 GRT or more.

              (3) To qualify for an endorsement of more than 1,600 GRT, but not more than 5,000 GRT, the vessel tonnage upon which the 3 years of required service was obtained will be used to compute the tonnage. The endorsement is limited to the maximum tonnage on which at least 25 percent of the required service was obtained, or 150 percent of the maximum tonnage on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained, whichever is higher. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 GRT, using the next higher figure when an intermediate tonnage is calculated.
              (4) The tonnage limitation on this endorsement may be raised using one of the following methods, but cannot exceed 5,000 GRT. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 GRT, using the next higher figure when an intermediate tonnage is calculated.
              (i) Three months of service as mate on a vessel results in a limitation in that capacity equal to the tonnage of that vessel rounded up to the next multiple of 1,000 GRT.

              (2) A towing vessel on an international voyage.
              (3) A towing vessel of 200 GRT or more on a domestic, near-coastal voyage.

              § 11.467
              Requirements for a national endorsement as operator of uninspected passenger vessels of less than 100 GRT.
              (a) This section applies to an applicant for the endorsement to operate an uninspected vessel of less than 100 GRT, equipped with propulsion machinery of any type, carrying six or fewer passengers.
              (b) An endorsement as OUPV for near-coastal waters limits the holder to service on domestic, near-coastal waters not more than 100 miles offshore, the Great Lakes, and all inland waters. Endorsements issued for inland waters include all inland waters except the Great Lakes. Endorsements may be issued for a particular local area under paragraph (f) or paragraph (g) of this section.
              (c) For an endorsement as OUPV on near-coastal waters, an applicant must have a minimum of 12 months of experience in the operation of vessels, including at least 3 months of service on vessels operating on ocean or near-coastal waters.
              (d) For an endorsement as OUPV on the Great Lakes and inland waters, an applicant must have 12 months of service on Great Lakes or inland waters, including at least 3 months of service operating vessels on Great Lakes waters.
              (e) For an endorsement as OUPV on inland waters, an applicant must have a minimum of 12 months of experience in the operation of vessels.

              (f) A limited OUPV endorsement may be issued to an applicant to be employed by organizations such as formal camps, yacht clubs, educational institutions, and marinas.

In order to obtain this restricted endorsement, an applicant must—
              (1) Have 3 months of service in the operation of the type of vessel for which the endorsement is requested;
              (2) Satisfactorily complete a safe-boating course approved by the National Association of State Boating Law Administrators, or those public education courses conducted by the U.S. Power Squadron or the American National Red Cross or a Coast Guard-approved course; and

              (4) Hold the first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) course certificates required by § 11.201(i) of this part when, in the opinion of the Coast Guard, the geographic area over which service is authorized precludes obtaining medical services within a reasonable time.
              (g) Restricted OUPV endorsements may be issued to applicants to be employed on inland navigable waters. An endorsement under this paragraph will be limited to specific bodies of water that have been approved by the cognizant OCMI. In order to obtain this endorsement, the applicant must be qualified for the endorsement under this section; however, the OCMI may modify the service and examination requirements as follows:
              (1) At least 3 months of service in the operation of the type of vessel and on each body of water for which the endorsement is requested.
              (2) Satisfactorily pass an examination appropriate for the activity to be conducted and the waters authorized.
              (h) An applicant for an officer endorsement as OUPV who speaks Spanish, but not English, may be issued an officer endorsement restricted to the navigable waters of the United States in the vicinity of Puerto Rico.

              (b) An applicant for an assistance towing endorsement must pass a written examination or complete a Coast Guard-approved course demonstrating his or her knowledge of assistance towing safety, equipment, and procedures.
              (c) The holder of a license or MMC for master, mate, or operator endorsed for assistance towing is authorized to engage in assistance towing on any vessel within the scope of the license or MMC.
              (d) The period of validity of the endorsement is the same as the license or MMC on which it is included, and it may be renewed with the MMC.
            
            
              § 11.491
              National officer endorsements for service on offshore supply vessels.

              (a) Each officer endorsement for service on offshore supply vessels (OSVs) authorizes service on OSVs as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(19) and as interpreted under 46 U.S.C. 14104(b), subject to any restrictions placed on the license or MMC.
              (b) For those officers who previously received a 500 GRT limitation on their national officer endorsement due to the definition of OSV existing before October 15, 2010, the limitation will be raised to 1,600 GRT to be consistent with other national officer endorsements.
            
            
              § 11.493
              Master (OSV).
              (a) The minimum service required to qualify an applicant for an endorsement as master (OSV) of offshore supply vessels less than 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT is 24 months of total service as mate, chief mate, or master of ocean or near-coastal and/or Great Lakes on self-propelled vessels of more than 100 GRT. Service on inland waters may substitute for up to 50 percent of the required service. At least one-half of the required experience must be served as chief mate.
              (b) The minimum service required to qualify an applicant for master (OSV) of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more is 24 months of total service as mate, chief mate, or master of ocean or near-coastal and/or Great Lakes on self-propelled vessels of more than 100 GRT. At least one-half of the required experience must be served as chief mate and be obtained on vessels of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more.
              (c) If an applicant for master (OSV) of more than 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT does not have the service on vessels of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more as required by paragraph (b) of this section, a tonnage limitation will be placed on the officer endorsement based on the applicant's qualifying experience. The endorsement will be limited to the maximum tonnage on which at least 25 percent of the required experience was obtained, or 150 percent of the maximum tonnage on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained, whichever is higher. However, the minimum tonnage limitation calculated according to this paragraph will be 2,000 GRT. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 GRT using the next higher figure when an intermediate tonnage is calculated. In no case will the limitation exceed 10,000 GRT/GT for OSVs unless the applicant meets the full requirements for an unlimited tonnage endorsement.
              (d) A person holding an endorsement as master (OSV) may qualify for an STCW endorsement, according to §§ 11.305 and 11.311 of this part.
              (e) The Coast Guard may exempt an applicant from meeting any requirement under STCW Regulation II/2 (incorporated by reference, see § 11.102 of this part) that the Coast Guard determines to be inappropriate or unnecessary for service on an OSV, or that the applicant meets under the equivalency provisions of Article IX of STCW.

              Propulsion power limitations for national endorsements.
              (a) Engineer endorsements of all grades and types may be subject to propulsion power limitations. Other than as provided in § 11.524 of this subpart for the designated duty engineer (DDE), the propulsion power limitation placed on a license or MMC endorsement is based on the applicant's qualifying experience considering the total shaft propulsion power of each vessel on which the applicant has served.
              (b) When an applicant for an original or raise of grade of an engineer endorsement, other than a DDE, has not obtained at least 50 percent of the required experience on vessels of 4,000 HP/3,000 kW or more, a propulsion power limitation is placed on the MMC based on the applicant's qualifying experience. The endorsement is limited to the maximum propulsion power on which at least 25 percent of the required experience was obtained, or 150 percent of the maximum propulsion power on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained, whichever is higher. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 HP/750 kW, using the next higher figure when an intermediate horsepower is calculated. When the limitation as calculated equals or exceeds 10,000 HP/7,500 kW, an unlimited propulsion power endorsement is issued.
              (c) The following service on vessels of 4,000 HP/3,000 kW or more will be considered qualifying for raising or removing the propulsion power limitations placed on an engineer endorsement:
              (1) Six months of service in the highest-grade endorsed: Removal of all propulsion power limitations.
              (2) Six months of service as an engineer officer in any capacity other than the highest grade for which the applicant is licensed or endorsed: Removal of all propulsion power limitations for the grade in which service is performed and raised to the next higher grade endorsement to the propulsion power of the vessel on which service was performed. The total cumulative service before and after issuance of the limited engineer endorsement may be considered in removing all propulsion power limitations.
              (3) Twelve months of service as oiler or junior engineer while holding a license or MMC endorsement as third assistant engineer or assistant engineer (limited): Removal of all propulsion power limitations on third assistant engineer or assistant engineer's (limited) endorsement.
              (4) Six months of service as oiler or junior engineer while holding a license or MMC endorsement as second assistant engineer: removal of all propulsion power limitations on third assistant engineer's endorsement.
              (d) Raising or removing propulsion power limitations based on service required by paragraph (c) of this section may be granted without further written examination, if the Coast Guard considers further examination unnecessary.

              (1) General routes (routes not restricted to rivers, canals and small lakes. The applicant must have at least 36 months of service in the deck department of self-propelled vessels navigating on oceans, coastwise, and Great Lakes, or bays, sounds, and lakes other than the Great Lakes, as follows:
              (i) Eighteen months of the 36 months of service must be performing bridge watchkeeping duties under the supervision of the master or a qualified officer.
              (ii) At least 12 months of the 18 months of service required in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section must be on vessels operating on the class of waters for which pilotage is desired.
              (2) River routes. The applicant must have at least 36 months of service in the deck department of any vessel including at least 12 months of service on vessels operating on the waters of rivers while the applicant is performing bridge watchkeeping duties under the supervision of the master or a qualified officer.
              (3) Canal and small lakes routes. The applicant must have at least 24 months of service in the deck department of any vessel including at least 8 months of service on vessels operating on canals or small lakes.
              (b) A graduate of the Great Lakes Maritime Academy in the deck class meets the service requirements of this section for an endorsement as first-class pilot on the Great Lakes.
              (c) Completion of an approved or accepted pilot training course may be substituted for a portion of the service requirements of this section in accordance with § 10.404 of this subchapter. Additionally, roundtrips made during this training may apply toward the route familiarization requirements of § 11.705 of this subpart. An individual using substituted service must have at least 9 months of shipboard service.

              § 11.705
              Route familiarization requirements.

              (a) The Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) has jurisdiction and determines within the range limitations specified in this section, the number of roundtrips required to qualify an applicant for a particular route, considering the following:
              (1) The geographic configuration of the waterway.
              (2) The type and size of vessels using the waterway.
              (3) The abundance or absence of aids to navigation.
              (4) The background lighting effects.
              (5) The known hazards involved, including waterway obstructions or constrictions such as bridges, narrow channels, or sharp turns.
              (6) Any other factors unique to the route that the OCMI deems appropriate.
              (b) An applicant holding no other deck officer endorsement seeking an endorsement as first-class pilot must furnish evidence of having completed a minimum number of roundtrips, while serving as quartermaster, wheelsman, able seaman, apprentice pilot, or in an equivalent capacity, standing regular watches at the wheel or in the pilot house as part of routine duties, over the route sought. Evidence of having completed a minimum number of roundtrips while serving as an observer, properly certified by the master and/or pilot of the vessel, is also acceptable. The range of roundtrips for an endorsement is a minimum of 12 roundtrips and a maximum of 20 roundtrips. An applicant may have additional routes added to the first-class pilot endorsement by meeting the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) An applicant who currently holds a deck officer license or MMC endorsement seeking an endorsement as first-class pilot for a particular route must furnish evidence of having completed the number of roundtrips over the route, specified by the OCMI, within the range limitations of this paragraph, for the particular grade of existing license or MMC endorsement held. The range of roundtrips for an endorsement is a minimum of eight roundtrips and a maximum of 15 roundtrips.
              (d) Unless determined impracticable by the OCMI, 25 percent of the roundtrips required by the OCMI under this section must be made during the hours of darkness.
              (e) One of the roundtrips required by the OCMI under this section must be made over the route within the 6 months immediately preceding the date of application.

              (a) This section applies only to an individual who pilots a vessel of 1,600 GRT or more.
              (b) Every person holding a license or MMC endorsement as first-class pilot must have a thorough physical examination each year, to be completed by the first day of the month following the anniversary of the individual's most recently completed Coast Guard-required physical examination. Every other year, in accordance with the medical certificate requirements in § 10.301(b) of this subchapter, the results of the physical examination must be recorded on a CG-719K form and submitted to the Coast Guard no later than 30 calendar days after completion of the physical examination.
              (c) Each annual physical examination must meet the requirements specified in 46 CFR, part 10, subpart C and be recorded on a CG-719-K.

              (d) An individual's first-class pilot endorsement becomes invalid on the first day of the month following the anniversary of the individual's most recently completed Coast Guard-required physical examination, if the person does not meet the physical examination requirement as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The individual may not operate under the authority of that endorsement until a physical examination has been satisfactorily completed.
            
            
              § 11.711
              Tonnage requirements.
              (a) In order to obtain a first-class pilot endorsement authorizing service on vessels of unlimited tonnage over a particular route, the applicant must have sufficient experience on vessels of more than 1,600 GRT.
              (b) For purposes of this section, an applicant is considered to have sufficient experience if the applicant has 18 months of experience as master, mate, quartermaster, wheelsman, able seaman, apprentice pilot, or in an equivalent capacity, standing regular watches at the wheel or in the pilothouse as part of routine duties, on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more, and two-thirds of the minimum number of roundtrips required for the route have been on vessels of 1,600 GRT or more.
              (c) If an applicant does not have sufficient experience on vessels of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more, the endorsement will be for a limited tonnage until the applicant completes a number of additional roundtrips, as determined by the OCMI, within the range contained in § 11.705(b) or (c) of this subpart, as appropriate on vessels of 1,600 GRT/3,000 GT or more.
              (d) For purposes of this section, for experience with respect to tonnage on towing vessels, the combined gross tonnage of the towing vessels and the vessels towed will be considered. However, the Coast Guard may require that all or a portion of the required number of roundtrips be obtained on self-propelled vessels of 1,600 GRT or more, when the Coast Guard determines that due to the nature of the waters and the overall experience of the applicant, self-propelled vessel experience is necessary to obtain a first-class pilot endorsement that is not restricted to tug and barge combinations.
              [USCG-2004-17914, 78 FR 77909, Dec. 24, 2013, as amended by USCG-2004-17914, 79 FR 55657, Sept. 17, 2014]
            
            
              § 11.713
              Requirements for maintaining current knowledge of waters to be navigated.
              (a) If a first-class pilot has not served over a particular route within the past 60 months, that person's license or MMC endorsement is invalid for that route, and remains invalid until the individual has made one re-familiarization round trip over that route, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Whether this requirement is satisfied or not has no effect on the renewal of other licenses or MMC endorsements. Roundtrips made within the 90-day period preceding renewal will be valid for the duration of the renewed license or MMC endorsement.
              (b) For certain long or extended routes, the OCMI may, at his or her discretion, allow the re-familiarization requirement to be satisfied by reviewing appropriate navigation charts, coast pilots tide and current tables, local Notice to Mariners, and any other materials that would provide the pilot with current knowledge of the route. Persons using this method of re-familiarization must certify, when applying for renewal of their license or MMC endorsement, the material they have reviewed and the dates on which this was accomplished. Review within the 90-day period preceding renewal is valid for the duration of the renewed MMC endorsement.

              (2) Present evidence of successful completion of a Coast Guard-approved type rating training program.
              (c) A separate TRE will be issued for each type and class of high speed craft. The original route will be as specified in the approved type rating program. Additional routes may be added to an existing TRE by completing at least 12 roundtrips over each route under the supervision of a type-rated master on the class of high speed craft the TRE will be valid for. Six of the trips must be made during the hours of darkness or a “daylight only” restriction will be imposed.
              (d) A TRE will be valid for 2 years. The expiration date of a TRE will not be changed due to the addition of additional routes.
              (e) To renew a TRE, an applicant must provide evidence of—
              (1) At least 6 months of service in the appropriate position on the type crafts to which the TRE applies during the preceding 2 years, including at least 12 roundtrips over each route, together with evidence of a completed revalidation assessment; or
              (2) Completion of an approved revalidation training program.

            Subpart I—Subjects of Examinations
            
              § 11.901
              General provisions.
              (a) Where required by § 11.903 of this subpart, each applicant for an endorsement listed in that section must pass an examination on the appropriate subjects listed in this subpart.
              (b) If the endorsement is to be limited in a manner that would render any of the subject matter unnecessary or inappropriate, the examination may be amended accordingly by the Coast Guard. Limitations that may affect the examination content are as follows:
              (1) Restricted routes for reduced service officer endorsements (master or mate of vessels of less than 200 GRT, OUPV, or master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels).
              (2) Limitations to a certain class or classes of vessels.
              (c) Simulators used in assessments of competence required by subpart C of this part must meet the appropriate performance standards set out in Section A-I/12 of the STCW Code (incorporated by reference, see § 11.102 of this part). However, simulators installed or brought into use before February 1, 2002, need not meet these performance standards if they fulfill the objective of the assessment of competence or demonstration of proficiency.

              Purpose of rules.
              (a) The rules in this subpart implement Regulation I/10 of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978 as amended (STCW) (incorporated by reference, see § 11.102 of this part) by establishing requirements and procedures for the recognition and endorsement of officer certificates of competence issued by other Parties to STCW.
              (b) Specific regulations on the use of non-U.S. credentialed officers and mariners with officer endorsements (except those of master) are found in § 15.720 of this subchapter.
            
            
              § 11.1003
              General requirements.
              (a) The Coast Guard recognizes certificates only from countries that the United States has assured itself comply with requirements of the STCW Convention and STCW Code (incorporated by reference, see § 11.102 of this part).

              (b) Approved training programs may be substituted for the required periods of service on deck as follows:
              (1) A graduate of a school ship may be qualified for a rating endorsement as A/B, without further service, upon satisfactory completion of the program of instruction. For this purpose, “school ship” is interpreted to mean an institution that offers a complete approved program of instruction, including a period of at-sea training, in the skills appropriate to the rating of A/B.
              (2) Training programs, other than those classified as a school ship, may be substituted for up to one-third of the required service on deck. The Coast Guard will determine the service/training ratio for each program and may allow a maximum of 3 days of deck service credit for each day of instruction.

            Subpart E—Requirements for National Engineer Rating Endorsements
            
              § 12.501
              General requirements for a qualified member of the engine department (QMED).
              (a) General. A qualified member of the engine department is any person below officer and above the rating of coal passer or wiper, who holds an MMC or MMD endorsed as QMED by the Coast Guard.
              (b) Categories. (1) Each QMED rating must be endorsed separately, unless the applicant qualifies for all QMED ratings, in which case the endorsement will read “QMED—any rating.” The ratings are—
              (i) Fireman/Watertender;
              (ii) Oiler;
              (iii) Junior engineer;
              (iv) Electrician/Refrigerating engineer; and
              (v) Pumpman/Machinist.
              (2) The Coast Guard will no longer issue original endorsements for deck engineer, deck/engine mechanic, or engineman, or individual endorsements for refrigerating engineer, machinist, electrician, and pumpman. However, a mariner who holds any of these endorsements may continue to renew them as long as he or she is otherwise qualified.
              (3) If the holder of an endorsement as pumpman only or machinist only seeks the combined endorsement of pumpman/machinist, the mariner must pass the examination described in Table 1 to § 12.505(c) of this subpart.
              (4) If the holder of an endorsement as electrician only or refrigerating engineer only seeks the combined endorsement of electrician/refrigerating engineer, the mariner must pass the examination described in Table 1 to § 12.505(c) of this subpart.
              (c) Requirements for certification. To qualify for any endorsement as QMED, an applicant must—
              (1) Be at least 18 years of age;

              (2) Pass the prescribed physical and medical examination requirements specified in 46 CFR Part 10, subpart C;
              
              (3) Present evidence of having passed a chemical test for dangerous drugs or of having qualified for an exemption from testing, as described in § 16.220 of this subchapter;
              (4) Meet the sea service or training requirements in § 12.503 of this subpart;
              (5) Pass an examination as QMED; and
              (6) Speak and understand the English language as would be required in performing the general duties of QMED and during an emergency aboard ship.

              (a) An applicant for an endorsement as QMED must provide the Coast Guard with proof of qualification based on 6 months of service in a rating at least equal to that of wiper or coal passer.
              (b) Approved training programs may be substituted for the required periods of service as follows:
              (1) A graduate of a school ship may qualify for a rating endorsement as QMED, without further service, upon satisfactory completion of the program of instruction. For this purpose, school ship is interpreted to mean an institution that offers a complete approved program of instruction, including a period of at-sea training, in the skills appropriate to the rating of QMED.
              (2) Training programs, other than those classified as a school ship, may be substituted for up to one-half of the required service. The service/training ratio for each program is determined by the Coast Guard.

              § 12.801
              Purpose.
              The rules in this subpart implement 46 U.S.C. 8103(k) by establishing requirements for the issuance of MMCs, valid only for service in the steward's department of U.S. flag large passenger vessels, to non-resident aliens.
            
            
              § 12.803
              General requirements.
              (a) Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, non-resident alien applicants for Coast Guard-issued MMCs are subject to all applicable requirements contained in this subchapter.
              (b) No application for an MMC from a non-resident alien issued pursuant to this subpart will be accepted unless the applicant's employer satisfies all of the requirements of § 12.805 of this subpart.
            
            
              § 12.805
              Employer requirements.
              (a) The employer must submit the following to the Coast Guard, as a part of the applicant's MMC application, on behalf of the applicant:
              (1) A signed report that contains all material disciplinary actions related to the applicant, such as, but not limited to, violence or assault, theft, drug and alcohol policy violations, and sexual harassment, along with an explanation of the criteria used by the employer to determine the materiality of those actions.
              (2) A signed report regarding an employer-conducted background check. The report must contain—
              (i) A statement that the applicant has successfully undergone an employer-conducted background check;
              (ii) A description of the employer-conducted background check, including all databases and records searched. The background check must, at a minimum, show that the employer has reviewed all information reasonably and legally available to the owner or managing operator, including the review of available court and police records in the applicant's country of citizenship, and any other country in which the applicant has received employment referrals, or resided, for the past 20 years prior to the date of application; and
              (iii) All information derived from the employer-conducted background check.
              (3) An employer-conducted background check, which must be conducted to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard for an MMC to be issued to the applicant.

              (b) If an MMC is issued to the applicant, the report and information required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be securely kept by the employer on the U.S. flag large passenger vessel on which the applicant is employed. The report and information must remain on the last U.S. flag large passenger vessel on which the applicant was employed until such time as the MMC is returned to the Coast Guard in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
              (c) If an MMC or a transportation worker identification credential (TWIC) is issued to the applicant, each MMC and TWIC must be securely kept by the employer on the U.S. flag large passenger vessel on which the applicant is employed. The employer must maintain a detailed record of the seaman's total service on all authorized U.S. flag large passenger vessels, and must make that information available to the Coast Guard upon request, to demonstrate that the limitations of § 12.811(c) of this subpart have not been exceeded.
              (d) In the event that the seaman's MMC and/or TWIC expires, the seaman's visa status terminates, the seaman serves onboard the U.S. flag large passenger vessel(s) for 36 months in the aggregate as a nonimmigrant crewman, the employer terminates employment of the seaman, or, if the seaman otherwise ceases working with the employer, the employer must return the MMC to the Coast Guard and/or the TWIC to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within 10 days of the event.
              (e) In addition to the initial material disciplinary actions report and the initial employer-conducted background check specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the employer must—
              (1) Submit to the National Maritime Center an annual material disciplinary actions report to update whether there have been any material disciplinary actions related to the applicant since the last material disciplinary actions report was submitted to the Coast Guard. The annual material disciplinary actions report must—
              (i) Be submitted to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard in accordance with the same criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that the period of time examined for the material disciplinary actions report need only extend back to the date of the last material disciplinary actions report; and
              (ii) Be submitted to the Coast Guard on or before the anniversary of the issuance date of the MMC; and
              (2) Conduct a background check each year that the MMC is valid to search for any changes that might have occurred since the last employer-conducted background check was performed. The annual background check must—
              (i) Be conducted to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard in accordance with the same criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except that the period of time examined during the annual background check need only extend back to the date of the last background check; and
              (ii) Be submitted to the Coast Guard on or before the anniversary of the issuance date of the MMC.
              (f) The employer is subject to the civil penalty provisions specified in 46 U.S.C. 8103(f) for any violation of this section.
            
            
              § 12.807
              Basis for denial.
              In addition to the requirements for an MMC established elsewhere in this subchapter, and the basis for denial established in §§ 10.209, 10.211, and 10.213 of this subchapter, an applicant for an MMC issued pursuant to this subpart must—
              (a) Have been employed for a period of at least 1 year on a foreign flag passenger vessel that is under the same common ownership or control as the U.S. flag large passenger vessel on which the applicant will be employed upon issuance of an MMC under this subpart;
              (b) Have no record of material disciplinary actions during the employment required under paragraph (a) of this section, as verified in writing by the owner or managing operator of the U.S. flag large passenger vessel on which the applicant will be employed;
              (c) Have successfully completed an employer-conducted background check to the satisfaction of both the employer and the Coast Guard; and
              (d) Meet the citizenship and identity requirements of § 12.809 of this subpart.
            
            
              
              § 12.809
              Citizenship and identity.
              (a) Instead of the requirements of § 10.221 of this subchapter, a non-resident alien may apply for a Coast Guard-issued MMC, endorsed and valid only for service in the steward's department of a U.S. flag large passenger vessel, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 8103(k)(5)(B), if he or she is employable in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101, et seq.), including an alien crewman described in section 101 (a)(15)(D)(i) of that Act.
              (b) To meet the citizenship and identity requirements of this subpart, an applicant must present an unexpired passport issued by the government of the country of which the applicant is a citizen or subject, and either a valid U.S. C-1/D Crewman Visa or another valid U.S. visa or authority deemed acceptable by the Coast Guard.
              (c) Any non-resident alien applying for an MMC under this subpart may not be a citizen of, or a temporary or permanent resident of, a country designated by the Department of State as a “State Sponsor of Terrorism” pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)) or section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2371).
            
            
              § 12.811
              Restrictions.
              (a) An MMC issued to a non-resident alien under this subpart authorizes service only in the steward's department of the U.S. flag large passenger vessel(s), that is/are under the same common ownership and control as the foreign flag passenger vessel(s) on which the non-resident alien served to meet the requirements of § 12.807(a) of this subpart.
              (1) The MMC will be endorsed for service in the steward's department, in accordance with § 12.703 of this part.
              (2) The MMC may also be endorsed for service as a food handler if the applicant meets the requirements of § 12.703 of this part.
              (3) No other rating or endorsement is authorized, except lifeboatman or lifeboatman-limited, in which case all applicable requirements of this subchapter and the STCW Convention and STCW Code (incorporated by reference, see § 12.103 of this part) must be met.
              (b) The following restrictions must be printed on the MMC, or be listed in an accompanying Coast Guard letter, or both:
              (1) The name and official number of all U.S. flag vessels on which the non-resident alien may serve. Service is not authorized on any other U.S. flag vessel.
              (2) Upon issuance, the MMC must remain in the custody of the employer at all times.
              (3) Upon termination of employment, the MMC must be returned to the Coast Guard within 10 days, in accordance with § 12.805 of this subpart.
              (4) A non-resident alien issued an MMC under this subpart may not perform watchstanding, engine room duty watch, or vessel navigation functions.
              (5) A non-resident alien issued an MMC under this subpart may perform emergency-related duties, provided that—
              (i) The emergency-related duties do not require any other rating or endorsement, except lifeboatman or lifeboatman-limited as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section;
              (ii) The non-resident alien has completed familiarization and basic training (BT), as required in § 15.1105 of this subchapter;
              (iii) If the non-resident alien serves as a lifeboatman or lifeboatman-limited, he or she has the necessary lifeboatman or lifeboatman-limited endorsement; and
              (iv) The non-resident alien has completed the training for crewmembers on passenger ships performing duties involving safety or care for passengers, as required in § 15.1103 of this subchapter.
              (c) A non-resident alien may only serve for an aggregate period of 36 months of actual service on all authorized U.S. flag large passenger vessels combined under the provisions of this subpart.

              (d) Once this 36-month limitation is reached, the MMC becomes invalid and must be returned to the Coast Guard under § 12.805(d) of this subpart, and the non-resident alien is no longer authorized to serve in a position requiring an MMC on any U.S. flag large passenger vessel.
              
              (e) An individual who successfully adjusts his or her immigration status to become either an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence to the United States, or a citizen of the United States, may apply for an MMC, subject to the requirements of § 10.221 of this subchapter, without any restrictions or limitations imposed by this subpart.
            
            
              § 12.813
              Alternative means of compliance.
              (a) The owner or managing operator of a U.S. flag large passenger vessel seeking to employ non-resident aliens issued MMCs under this subpart may submit a plan to the Coast Guard, which, if approved, will serve as an alternative means of complying with the requirements of this subpart.
              (b) The plan must address all the elements contained in this subpart, as well as the related elements contained in § 15.530 of this subchapter, to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard.

              § 13.107
              Tankerman endorsement: General.
              (a) If an applicant meets the requirements of subpart B of this part, the Coast Guard may endorse his or her MMC as tankerman-PIC with the appropriate cargo classification or classifications. A person holding this endorsement and meeting the other requirements of 33 CFR 155.710(a) may act as a PIC of a transfer of fuel oil, of a transfer of liquid cargo in bulk, or of cargo-tank cleaning on any tank vessel. That person may also act as a tankerman-engineer, provided that he or she also holds an engineer license or engineer endorsement.
              (b) If an applicant meets the requirements of subpart C of this part, the Coast Guard may endorse his or her MMC as tankerman-PIC (barge) with the appropriate cargo classification or classifications. A person holding this endorsement and meeting the other requirements of 33 CFR 155.710(b) may act as a PIC of a transfer of liquid cargo in bulk only on a tank barge.
              (c) If an applicant meets the requirements of subpart D of this part, the Coast Guard may endorse his or her MMC as tankerman-assistant with the appropriate cargo classification or classifications. No person holding this endorsement may act as a PIC of any transfer of fuel oil, of any transfer of liquid cargo in bulk, or of cargo-tank cleaning unless he or she also holds an endorsement authorizing service as PIC. He or she may, however, without being directly supervised by the PIC, perform duties relative to cargo and cargo-handling equipment assigned by the PIC of transfers of fuel oil, of transfers of liquid cargo in bulk, or of cargo-tank cleaning. When performing these duties, he or she shall maintain continuous two-way voice communications with the PIC.
              (d) If an applicant meets the requirements of subpart E of this part, the Coast Guard may endorse his or her MMC as tankerman-engineer. No person holding this endorsement may act as a PIC or tankerman-assistant of any transfer of liquid cargo in bulk, or of cargo-tank cleaning unless he or she also holds an endorsement authorizing such service. A person holding this endorsement and acting in this capacity has the primary responsibility, on his or her self-propelled tank vessel carrying dangerous liquid (DL) or liquefied gas (LG), for maintaining both the cargo systems and equipment for transfer of liquid cargo in bulk. No person licensed or credentialed under part 11 of this chapter may serve as a chief engineer, first assistant engineer, or cargo engineer aboard an inspected self-propelled tank vessel when liquid cargo in bulk or cargo residue is carried unless he or she holds an endorsement as tankerman-engineer or equivalent.
              (e) If an applicant meets the requirements of § 13.111 of this subpart, the Coast Guard may place on his or her MMC an endorsement as a tankerman-PIC restricted according to the definitions of “restricted tankerman endorsement” in § 10.107 of this subchapter.
              (f) This section does not apply to any person solely by reason of his or her involvement in bunkering or fueling.

              (c) To qualify for a restricted tankerman-PIC (barge) endorsement, an applicant must meet §§ 13.301 (excluding paragraph (c)(4)), 13.303, and 13.305 of this part.
              (1) Twenty-five percent of the service described in § 13.303(a) of this part must have occurred within the past 5 years.
              (2) Two of the transfers described in § 13.303(b) of this part must have occurred within the past 5 years.
              (d) To qualify for a restricted tankerman-PIC (barge) endorsement restricted to a tank-cleaning and gas-freeing facility, an applicant must—
              (1) Be at least 18 years old;
              (2) Apply on a form provided by the Coast Guard;
              (3) Present evidence of passing a physical and medical examination according to § 13.125 of this part;
              (4) Present evidence in the form of a letter, which must be dated within the 5 years prior to the application for the credential, on company letterhead from the operator of the facility stating that OSHA considers the applicant a “competent person (as designated under 29 CFR 1915.7)” for the facility and that the applicant has the knowledge necessary to supervise tank-cleaning and gas-freeing; and
              (5) Be capable of speaking and understanding, in English, all instructions needed to commence, conduct, and complete a transfer of cargo, and of reading and understanding the English found in the Declaration of Inspection, vessel response plans, and Cargo Information Cards.
              (e) The restricted tankerman-PIC (barge) endorsement restricted to a tank-cleaning and gas-freeing facility is valid only while the applicant is employed by the operator of the facility that provided the letter of service required by paragraph (d)(4) of this section, and this and any other appropriate restrictions will appear in the endorsement.
              (f) A restricted tankerman-PIC endorsement limited to operation on vessels inside the boundary line is not valid where STCW certification is required.

              Service: General.
              (a) A service letter must be signed by the owner, operator, master, or chief engineer of the vessel and must specify the following:
              (1) The name of the vessel, official number for the vessel, and date of service for each vessel.
              (2) For endorsements as tankerman-PIC, tankerman-PIC (barge), and tankerman-assistant, the classification of cargo (DL, LG, or, for a restricted endorsement, a specific product) handled while the applicant accumulated the service.
              (3) The dates, the numbers and kinds of transfers the applicants have participated in, the ports or terminals, if applicable, and the number of transfers that involved commencement or completion of loading or discharge.
              (4) For endorsements as tankerman-PIC or tankerman-PIC (barge), that the applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the signer that he or she is fully capable of supervising transfers of liquid cargo, including—
              (i) Pre-transfer inspection;
              (ii) Pre-transfer conference and execution of the Declaration of Inspection;
              (iii) Connection of cargo hoses or loading-arms;
              (iv) Line-up of the cargo system for loading and discharge;
              (v) Start of liquid flow during loading;
              (vi) Start of cargo pump and increase of pressure to normal discharge pressure;
              (vii) Calculation of loading-rates;
              (viii) Monitoring;
              (ix) Topping-off of cargo tanks during loading;
              (x) Stripping of cargo tanks;
              (xi) Ballasting and deballasting, if appropriate;
              (xii) Disconnection of the cargo hoses or loading-arms; and
              (xiii) Securing of cargo systems.
              (5) For endorsements as tankerman-engineer, that the applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the signer that he or she is fully capable of supervising transfers of fuel oil, including—
              (i) Pre-transfer inspection;
              (ii) Pre-transfer conference and execution of the Declaration of Inspection;
              (iii) Connection of hoses or loading-arms;
              (iv) Line-up of the piping system for loading and transfer of fuel oil;
              (v) Start of liquid flow during loading;

              (b) In determining the numbers and kinds of transfers that the applicant has participated in under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the following rules apply:

              (1) A transfer must involve the loading or discharge from at least one of the vessel's cargo tanks to or from a shore facility or another vessel. A shift of cargo from one tank to another tank is not a transfer for this purpose.
              (2) Regardless of how long the transfer lasts beyond 4 hours, it counts as only one transfer.
              (3) A transfer must include both a commencement and a completion.
              (4) Regardless of how many tanks or products are being loaded or discharged at the same time, a person may receive credit for only one transfer, one loading, and one discharge conducted during each watch.
              (5) Credit for a transfer during a watch of less than 4 hours accrues only if the watch includes either the connection and the commencement of transfer or the completion of transfer and the disconnection.
              (6) Credit for a commencement of loading accrues only if the applicant participates in the pre-transfer inspection, the pre-transfer conference including execution of the Declaration of Inspection, the connection of hoses or loading-arms, the line-up of the system for the loading, the start of liquid flow, and the calculation of loading-rates, where applicable.
              (7) Credit for a commencement of discharge accrues only if the applicant participates in the pre-transfer inspection, the pre-transfer conference including execution of the Declaration of Inspection, the connection of hoses or loading-arms, the line-up of the cargo system for the discharge, the start of the pump or pumps and increase of pressure to normal pressure for discharge, and the monitoring of discharge rates.
              (8) Credit for a completion of transfer, whether loading or discharge, accrues only if the applicant participates in the topping-off at the loading port, or in the stripping of cargo tanks and the commencement of ballasting, if required by the vessel's transfer procedures, at the discharge port.
              (9) Personnel desiring credit for transfers during off-duty hours may satisfy requirements of competence through incremental training periods that include segments of transfers. The cumulative number of transfers must equal the minimum specified in §§ 13.203(b) or 13.303(b) of this subchapter.
              (c) Service on Articulated Tug Barges (ATBs). Service on ATBs with an aggregate tonnage of 1,600 GRT or more will be creditable on a case-by-case basis and with prior authorization by the Coast Guard, provided the ATB equipment is comparable to tank vessel equipment. The Coast Guard may issue blanket authorizations for classes of ATBs.

              General.
              Unless otherwise provided by Title 46 United States Code, by any act amending or supplementing that title, or by this subpart, that title as far as it governs the employment of merchant mariners remains, and any act amending or supplementing that title becomes, applicable to oceanographic research vessels.

              Exemptions.
              (a) Certain requirements of Title 46, United States Code do not apply to the employment of merchant mariners on oceanographic research vessels. These requirements are those concerned with, among other things, the shipment and discharge of mariners, their pay and allotments, and the adequacy of their clothing. 46 U.S.C. 2113(2) allows exemptions of oceanographic research vessels from certain requirements of parts B, C, F, or G of subtitle II of 46 U.S.C., upon such terms as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security deems suitable. The exemptions available under this subpart are subject to the following terms:
              (1) No use of any exemption relieves the owner, charterer, managing operator, master, or individual in charge of the vessel of other statutory responsibilities for the protection of every mariner under his or her command.
              (2) If it is presented at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner, the master or individual in charge must receive, consider, and appropriately address the legitimate complaint of any mariner.
              (b) For any oceanographic research vessel sailing with any mariner employed by any firm, association, corporation, or educational or governmental body or agency, the Commandant may grant exemptions from—

              Procedures.
              (a) Upon written request for the owner, charterer, managing operator, master, or individual in charge of the vessel to the Coast Guard OCMI in whose zone the vessel is located, the Commandant may grant an exemption of any oceanographic research vessel designated by 46 U.S.C. 2113(2) from any requirement of any section listed by § 14.403(b).
              (b) The request must state—
              (1) Any requirement of any section listed in § 14.403(b) from which the applicant wishes an exemption; and
              (2) What business practices regarding, among other things, the shipment and discharge of merchant mariners, their pay and allotments, and the adequacy of their clothing would justify the exemption.
              (c) The Coast Guard will forward the request, along with his or her recommendation, to the Commandant, who will determine whether to grant any exemption of any vessel from any requirement. The Coast Guard will issue a letter indicating any exemption granted. The master or individual in charge of the vessel must keep the letter aboard the vessel.
              (d) If operating conditions change, the owner, charterer, managing operator, master, or individual in charge of the vessel must so advise the Coast Guard .

              (a) The owner, charterer, managing operator, master, or individual in charge of each oceanographic research vessel of 100 GRT or more must maintain a record of the employment, discharge, or termination of service of every merchant mariner in the crew. At least every 6 months, the person maintaining this record shall transmit it to the Coast Guard, either manually, in the form of a copy of a certificate of discharge, or electronically to the address provided in § 14.103 of this part.
              (b) The owner, charterer, managing operator, master, or individual in charge of the vessel must keep original shipping articles and a copy of each certificate of discharge ready for review by the Coast Guard or the concerned mariner upon request. The Coast Guard will no longer keep either original articles or copies of certificates of discharge; it will keep only electronic records of employment.
              (c) The master or individual in charge of the vessel must ensure that every entry made in the articles agrees with the corresponding entry made in a continuous discharge book, on a certificate of discharge, or in any other proof of sea service furnished to the mariner.
              (d) Each oceanographic company must keep all original articles and copies of all certificates of discharge for 3 years. After 3 years the company must prepare the original shipping articles in alphabetical order by vessel name and send to the address in § 14.103(a) of this part for storage at the Federal Records Center at Suitland, Maryland.

It is the responsibility of the owner, charterer, managing operator, master, or person in charge or in command of the vessel to ensure that appropriate personnel are carried to meet the requirements of the applicable navigation and shipping laws and regulations.
              (c) Inspected vessels are issued a Certificate of Inspection (COI) which indicates the minimum complement of officers and crew (including lifeboatmen) considered necessary for safe operation. The COI complements the statutory requirements but does not supersede them.

              (d) Uninspected vessels operating on an international voyage may be issued a safe manning certificate indicating the minimum complement of qualified mariners necessary for safe operation.
              
              (e) The regulations in subpart K of this part apply to seagoing vessels subject to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended (STCW).
              (f) Persons serving on any of the following vessels, or any owner or operator of any of these vessels, do not need to meet the requirements of subpart K of this part, because the vessels are exempt from application of STCW:
              (1) Fishing vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(11)(a).
              (2) Fishing vessels used as fish-tender vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(11)(c).
              (3) Barges as defined in 46 U.S.C. 102, including non-self-propelled mobile offshore drilling units.
              (4) Vessels operating exclusively on the Great Lakes or on the inland waters of the U.S. in the Straits of Juan de Fuca or on the Inside Passage between Puget Sound and Cape Spencer.
              (5) Pilot vessels engaged on pilotage duty.
              (g) Owners and operators, and personnel serving on the following small vessels engaged exclusively on domestic, near-coastal voyages are in compliance with subpart K of this part and are, therefore, not subject to further requirements for the purposes of the STCW Convention:
              (1) Small passenger vessels subject to subchapter T or K of 46 CFR chapter I.
              (2) Vessels of less than 200 GRT, other than passenger vessels subject to subchapter H of 46 CFR chapter I.
              (3) Uninspected passenger vessels (UPVs) as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(42)(B).
              (h) Personnel serving on vessels identified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section may be issued, without additional proof of qualification, an appropriate STCW endorsement on their license or MMC when the Coast Guard determines that such an endorsement is necessary to enable the vessel to engage on a single international voyage of a non-routine nature. The STCW endorsement will be expressly limited to service on the vessel or the class of vessels and will not establish qualification for any other purpose.

              (3) A public vessel as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101.
              (b) Towing vessels 8 meters or more in length. Every towing vessel of at least 8 meters (26 feet) in length, measured from end to end over the deck (excluding sheer), must be under the direction and control of a person holding a MMC endorsed as master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels or as master or mate of vessels of greater than 200 gross register tons, holding a completed Towing Officer Assessment Record signed by a designated examiner indicating that the officer is proficient in the operation of towing vessels upon the appropriate route.
              (c) Towing Vessels of Any Length on the Lower Mississippi River. In addition to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, any towing vessel operating in the pilotage waters of the Lower Mississippi River must be under the control of an officer who holds either a first-class pilot's endorsement for that route, or MMC officer endorsement for the Western Rivers, or who meets the requirements of either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable.
              (1) Moving tank or hazardous material barges. To operate a towing vessel with tank barges or a tow of barges carrying hazardous material regulated under subchapter N or O of this chapter, the officer in charge of the towing vessel must have completed at least 12 round trips over this route as an observer, with at least 3 of those trips during hours of darkness, and must provide evidence to the Coast Guard upon request that at least 1 of the 12 round trips occurred within the last 5 years.
              (2) Moving uninspected barges or no barges. To operate a towing vessel without barges or a tow of uninspected barges, the officer in charge of the towing vessel must have completed at least 4 round trips over this route as an observer, with at least 1 of those trips during hours of darkness, and must provide evidence to the Coast Guard upon request that at least 1 of the 4 round trips occurred within the last 5 years.

              (a) This section implements the Officers Competency Certificates Convention, 1936 (see 46 U.S.C. 8304), and applies to each vessel documented under the laws of the United States navigating seaward of the Boundary Lines in part 7 of this chapter, except:
              (1) A public vessel;
              (2) A wooden vessel of primitive build, such as a dhow or junk;
              (3) A barge; and
              (4) A vessel of less than 200 gross tons.
              (b) The master, mates and engineers on any vessel to which this section applies must hold a license or MMC officer endorsement to serve in that capacity issued by the Coast Guard under parts 10 and 11 of this subchapter.

              (c) A vessel to which this section applies, or a foreign flag vessel to which the Officers Competency Certificates Convention applies, may be detained by a designated official until that official is satisfied that the vessel is in compliance with the Convention. Designated official includes Coast Guard officers, Coast Guard petty officers and officers or employees of the Customs and Border Protection Service.
              (d) Whenever a vessel is detained, the owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, or individual in charge may appeal the detention within 5 days under the provisions of § 2.01-70 of this chapter.

              § 15.705
              Watches.
              (a) Title 46 U.S.C. 8104 applies to the establishment of watches aboard certain U.S. vessels. The establishment of adequate watches is the responsibility of the vessel's master. The Coast Guard interprets the term “watch” to be the direct performance of vessel operations, whether deck or engine, where such operations would routinely be controlled and performed in a scheduled and fixed rotation. The performance of maintenance or work necessary to the vessel's safe operation on a daily basis does not in itself constitute the establishment of a watch. The minimum safe manning levels specified in a vessel's COI or other safe manning document take into consideration routine maintenance requirements and ability of the crew to perform all operational evolutions, including emergencies, as well as those functions which may be assigned to persons in watches.
              (b) Subject to exceptions, 46 U.S.C. 8104 requires that when a master of a seagoing vessel of more than 100 GRT establishes watches for the officers, sailors, and oilers, “the personnel shall be divided, when at sea, into at least three watches and shall be kept on duty successively to perform ordinary work incidental to the operation and management of the vessel.” Solely for the purposes of this part, the Coast Guard interprets “sailors” to mean those members of the deck department other than officers, whose duties involve the mechanics of conducting the ship on its voyage, such as helmsman (wheelsman), lookout, etc., and which are necessary to the maintenance of a continuous watch. The term “sailors” is not interpreted to include able seamen and ordinary seamen not performing these duties.

              (c)(1) Subject to exceptions, 46 U.S.C. 8104(g) permits the officers and crew members to be divided into two watches when at sea and engaged on a voyage of less than 600 miles on the following categories of vessels—
              (i) Towing vessel;
              (ii) Offshore supply vessels, except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or
              (iii) Barge.
              (2) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies to an OSV of at least 6,000 GT ITC (500 GRT if GT ITC is not assigned), as defined in § 125.160 of this chapter, if the individuals engaged on the vessel are in compliance with the work hours and rest period requirements in § 15.1111 of this part.
              (d) Subject to exceptions, 46 U.S.C. 8104(h) permits a master or mate (pilot) operating a towing vessel that is at least 8 meters (26 feet) in length measured from end to end over the deck (excluding sheer) to work not more than 12 hours in a consecutive 24-hour period except in an emergency. The Coast Guard interprets this, in conjunction with other provisions of the law, to permit masters or mates (pilots) serving as operators of towing vessels that are not subject to the provisions of the Officers' Competency Certificates Convention, 1936 (see 46 U.S.C. 8304), to be divided into two watches regardless of the length of the voyage.
              (e) Fish processing vessels are subject to various provisions of 46 U.S.C. 8104 concerning watches, including—
              (1) For fish processing vessels that entered into service before January 1, 1988, the following watch requirements apply to the officers and deck crew:
              (i) If more than 5,000 GRT—three watches.
              (ii) If more than 1,600 GRT and not more than 5,000 GRT—two watches.
              (iii) If not more than 1,600 GRT—no watch division specified; or
              (2) For fish processing vessels that entered into service after December 31, 1987, the following watch requirements apply to the officers and deck crew:
              (i) If more than 5,000 GRT—three watches.
              (ii) If not more than 5,000 GRT and having more than 16 individuals onboard, primarily employed in the preparation of fish or fish products—two watches.
              (iii) If not more than 5,000 GRT and having not more than 16 individuals onboard, primarily employed in the preparation of fish or fish products—no watch division specified.
              (f) Properly manned uninspected passenger vessels of at least 100 GRT—
              (1) Which are underway for no more than 12 hours in any 24-hour period, and which are adequately moored, anchored, or otherwise secured in a harbor of safe refuge for the remainder of that 24-hour period, may operate with one navigational watch;
              (2) Which are underway more than 12 hours in any 24-hour period, must provide a minimum of a two-watch system;
              (3) In no case may the crew of any watch work more than 12 hours in any 24-hour period, except in an emergency.

              In addition to prescribing watch requirements, 46 U.S.C. 8104 sets limitations on the working hours of credentialed officers and crew members, prescribes certain rest periods, and prohibits unnecessary work on Sundays and certain holidays when the vessel is in a safe harbor. It is the responsibility of the master or person in charge to ensure that these limitations are met. However, under 46 U.S.C. 8104(f), the master or other credentialed officer can require any part of the crew to work when, in his or her judgment, they are needed for:
              (a) Maneuvering, shifting berth, mooring, unmooring;
              (b) Performing work necessary for the safety of the vessel, or the vessel's passengers, crew, or cargo;
              (c) Saving of life onboard another vessel in jeopardy; or,

              Automated vessels.
              (a) Coast Guard acceptance of automated systems to replace specific personnel or to reduce overall crew requirements is predicated upon the capabilities of the system, the system's demonstrated and continuing reliability, and a planned maintenance program that ensures continued safe operation of the vessel.
              (b) The OCMI considers the capabilities of an automated system in establishing initial manning levels; however, until the system is proven reliable, a manning level adequate to operate in a continuously attended mode will be specified on a vessel's COI. It remains the responsibility of the vessel's master to determine when a continuous watch is necessary.
            
            
              § 15.720
              Use of non-U.S.-credentialed personnel.
              (a) United States vessels which need to replace one or more persons while on a foreign voyage and outside the jurisdiction of the United States, in order to meet manning requirements, may use non-U.S. credentialed personnel without a TWIC, except for the positions of master and radio officer, until the vessel returns to a port at which in the most expeditious manner replacements who are citizens of the United States can be obtained.
              (b) The citizenship requirements of 46 U.S.C. 8103(a) and (b) and the TWIC requirement of 46 U.S.C. 70105 are waived, except for the requirement that the master must be a U.S. citizen holding a TWIC, with respect to the following vessels:
              (1) A U.S.-documented offshore supply vessel (OSV) (as that term is defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(19)) that is operating from a foreign port; and
              (2) A U.S.-documented mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) (as that term is defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(15a)) that is operating beyond the water above the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.
              (c) The waiver provided in paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to any vessel operating in water above the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (as that term is defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331(a)).
              (d) The master must assure that any replacements of crewmembers by non-U.S. citizens made in accordance with this section will be with an individual who holds a credential that required experience, training, and other qualifications equivalent to the U.S. credential required for the position and that the person possesses or will possess the training required to communicate to the extent required by § 15.730 of this part.
              (e) Non-U.S.-credentialed officers serving onboard vessels subject to STCW must hold a “Certificate attesting recognition” in accordance with part 11, subpart J of this subchapter. A mariner may serve for a period not to exceed 3 months onboard the vessel while the Coast Guard is processing his or her application for such a certificate.

              Language requirements.
              (a) The provisions of 46 U.S.C. 8702 relating to language apply generally to vessels of at least 100 GRT except:
              (1) Vessels operating on rivers and lakes except the Great Lakes;
              (2) A manned barge except a seagoing barge or a barge to which chapter 37 of 46 U.S.C. applies;
              (3) A fishing vessel, fish tender vessel, whaling vessel, or yacht;
              (4) A sailing school vessel with respect to sailing school instructors and sailing school students;
              (5) An oceanographic research vessel with respect to scientific personnel;
              (6) A fish processing vessel which entered into service before January 1, 1988, and is not more than 1,600 GRT or which entered into service after December 31, 1987, and has not more than 16 individuals onboard primarily employed in the preparation of fish or fish products; and
              (7) All fish processing vessels with respect to those personnel primarily employed in the preparation of fish or fish products or in a support position not related to navigation.

              (b) 46 U.S.C. 8702(b) requires that onboard vessels departing U.S. ports 75 percent of the crew in each department onboard is able to understand any order spoken by the officers.
              
              (c) The words able to understand any order spoken by the officers relates to any order to a member of the crew when directing the performance of that person's duties and orders relating to emergency situations such as used for response to a fire or in using lifesaving equipment. It is not expected that a member of the deck department understand terminology normally used only in the engineroom or vice versa.
              (d) Whenever information is presented to the Coast Guard that a vessel fails to comply with the specified language requirements the Coast Guard investigates the allegation to determine its validity. In determining if an allegation is factual, the Coast Guard may require a demonstration by the officers and crew that appropriate orders are understood. The demonstration will require that orders be spoken to the individual members of the crew by the officers in the language ordinarily and customarily used by the officers. The orders must be spoken directly by the officer to the crew member and not through an interpreter. Signs, gestures, or signals may not be used in the test. The Coast Guard representative will specify the orders to be given and will include not only daily routine but orders involving emergencies, either of a departmental or of a general nature. This test will be conducted, if possible, at a time reasonably in advance of the vessel's departure, to avoid delays.

              Mates.
              (a) The OCMI determines the minimum number of mates required for the safe operation of inspected vessels.
              (b) The minimum number of mariners holding a license or MMC officer endorsement as mate required to be carried on every inspected, self-propelled, seagoing and Great Lakes vessel, and every inspected, seagoing, passenger vessel must not be less than the following, except when reductions are authorized under paragraph (e) of this section:
              (1) Vessels of 1,000 GRT or more (except MODUs)—three mates (except when on a voyage of less than 400 miles from port of departure to port of final destination—two mates).
              (2) MODUs of 1,000 GRT or more:
              (i) Three mates when on a voyage of more than 72 hours.

              (iii) One mate when on a voyage of not more than 16 hours.
              (3) Vessels of 100 GRT or more but less than 1,000 GRT—two mates (except vessels of at least 100 but less than 200 GRT on voyages which do not exceed 24 hours in duration—one mate).
              (4) All vessels of less than 100 GRT—one mate (except vessels on voyages not exceeding 12 hours in duration may, if the OCMI determines it to be safe, be operated without mates).
              (5) An offshore supply vessel of 100 GRT (100 GT ITC if GRT is not assigned) or more, but less than 6,000 GT ITC (500 GRT if GT ITC is not assigned) as defined in § 125.160 of this chapter—one credentialed mate (except when on a voyage of at least 600 miles—two credentialed mates). A voyage includes the accrued distance from port of departure to port of arrival and does not include stops at offshore points.
              (6) An offshore supply vessel of at least 6,000 GT ITC (500 GRT if GT ITC is not assigned) as defined in § 125.160 of this chapter—two credentialed mates provided that the OSV meets the requirements in 46 CFR 15.1111 (except when on a voyage of more than 600 miles—three credentialed mates). A voyage includes the accrued distance from the vessel's port of departure to the vessel's port of arrival. Stops at offshore points or facilities do not constitute separate voyages; stops at offshore points or facilities are included in the total accrued distance between the vessel's port of departure and the vessel's port of arrival.
              (c) An individual in charge of the navigation or maneuvering of a self-propelled, uninspected, documented, seagoing vessel of 200 GRT or over must hold an appropriate license or MMC authorizing service as mate.
              (d) Each person in charge of the navigation or maneuvering of a towing vessel of at least 8 meters (26 feet) in length must satisfy the requirements of § 15.805(a)(5) of this part or hold a license or MMC authorizing service as either—
              (1) Mate (pilot) of towing vessels; or

              (2) Mate of inspected self-propelled vessels greater than 200 GRT within any other restrictions on the officer's license or MMC, holding either—
              
              (i) A completed TOAR bearing the signature from a Designated Examiner and stating that the Examiner found the candidate proficient; or
              (ii) A license or MMC with officer endorsement for towing vessels.
              (e) The OCMI may increase the minimum number of mates indicated in paragraph (b) of this section where he or she determines that the vessel's characteristics, route, or other operating conditions create special circumstances warranting an increase.
              (f) The Commandant will consider reductions to the number of mates required by this section when special circumstances allowing a vessel to be safely operated can be demonstrated.
              (g) On vessels subject to STCW, the individual meeting the requirement of this section must also hold an STCW endorsement as officer in charge of a navigational watch with the appropriate tonnage for the vessel which he or she is operating, except as noted in § 15.105 (g) of this part for vessels on domestic near-coastal voyages.

              (b) If an individual fails a chemical test for dangerous drugs under this part, the individual will be presumed to be a user of dangerous drugs.
              (c) If an individual holding a credential fails a chemical test for dangerous drugs, the individual's employer, prospective employer, or sponsoring organization must report the test results in writing to the nearest Coast Guard Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI). The individual must be denied employment as a crewmember or must be removed from duties which directly affect the safe operation of the vessel as soon as practicable and is subject to suspension and revocation proceedings against his or her credential under 46 CFR part 5.
              (d) If an individual who does not hold a credential fails a chemical test for dangerous drugs, the individual shall be denied employment as a crewmember or removed from duties which directly affect the safe operation of the vessel as soon as possible.
              (e) An individual who has failed a required chemical test for dangerous drugs may not be re-employed aboard a vessel until the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section and 46 CFR Part 5, if applicable, have been satisfied.

              (f) Before an individual who has failed a required chemical test for dangerous drugs may return to work aboard a vessel, the MRO must determine that the individual is drug-free and the risk of subsequent use of dangerous drugs by that person is sufficiently low to justify his or her return to work. In addition, the individual must agree to be subject to increased unannounced testing—
              (1) For a minimum of six (6) tests in the first year after the individual returns to work as required in 49 CFR part 40; and
              (2) For any additional period as determined by the MRO up to a total of 60 months.

              § 16.230
              Random testing requirements.
              (a) Marine employers shall establish programs for the chemical testing for dangerous drugs on a random basis of crewmembers on inspected vessels who:
              (1) Occupy a position, or perform the duties and functions of a position, required by the vessel's Certificate of Inspection;
              (2) Perform the duties and functions of patrolmen or watchmen required by this chapter; or,
              (3) Are specifically assigned the duties of warning, mustering, assembling, assisting, or controlling the movement of passengers during emergencies.
              (b) Marine employers shall establish programs for the chemical testing for dangerous drugs on a random basis of crewmembers on uninspected vessels who:
              (1) Are required by law or regulation to hold a license issued by the Coast Guard in order to perform their duties on the vessel;
              (2) Perform duties and functions directly related to the safe operation of the vessel;
              (3) Perform the duties and functions of patrolmen or watchmen required by this chapter; or,
              (4) Are specifically assigned the duties of warning, mustering, assembling, assisting, or controlling the movement of passengers during emergencies.

              (c) The selection of crewmembers for random drug testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with crewmembers' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the testing frequency and selection process used, each covered crewmember shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made and an employee's chance of selection shall continue to exist throughout his or her employment. As an alternative, random selection may be accomplished by periodically selecting one or more vessels and testing all crewmembers covered by this section, provided that each vessel subject to the marine employer's test program remains equally subject to selection.
              
              (d) Marine employers may form or otherwise use sponsoring organizations, or may use contractors, to conduct the random chemical testing programs required by this part.
              (e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered crewmembers.
              (f) The annual rate for random drug testing may be adjusted in accordance with this paragraph.

              (1) The Commandant's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported random positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Commandant considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from marine employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry random positive rate. Each year, the Commandant will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered crewmembers. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication.
              (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Commandant may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered crewmembers if the Commandant determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of 46 CFR 16.500 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the positive rate is less than 1.0 percent.
              (3) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of 46 CFR 16.500 for any calendar year indicate that the positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Commandant will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50 percent of all covered crewmembers.
              (g) Marine employers shall randomly select a sufficient number of covered crewmembers for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing determined by the Commandant. If the marine employer conducts random drug testing through a consortium, the number of crewmembers to be tested may be calculated for each individual marine employer or may be based on the total number of covered crewmembers covered by the consortium who are subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this part or any DOT drug testing rule.
              (h) Each marine employer shall ensure that random drug tests conducted under this part are unannounced and that the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
              (i) If a given covered crewmember is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same marine employer, the crewmember shall be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the crewmember's function.
              (j) If a marine employer is required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the marine employer may—
              (1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered crewmembers who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or
              (2) Randomly select such crewmembers for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the marine employer is subject.

              (k) An individual may not be engaged or employed, including self-employment, on a vessel in a position as master, operator, or person in charge for which a credential is required by law or regulation unless all crewmembers covered by this section are subject to the random testing requirements of this section.

              (b) The marine employer's decision to test must be based on a reasonable and articulable belief that the individual has used a dangerous drug based on direct observation of specific, contemporaneous physical, behavioral, or performance indicators of probable use. Where practicable, this belief should be based on the observation of the individual by two persons in supervisory positions.
              (c) When the marine employer requires testing of an individual under the provisions of this section, the individual must be informed of that fact and directed to provide a urine specimen as soon as practicable.

              (a) Portable and semi-portable extinguishers must be inspected and maintained in accordance with NFPA 10 (incorporated by reference, see § 25.01-3).
              (b) Certification or licensing by a state or local jurisdiction as a fire extinguisher servicing agency will be accepted by the Coast Guard as meeting the personnel certification requirements of NFPA 10 for annual maintenance and recharging of extinguishers.
              (c) Monthly inspections required by NFPA 10 may be conducted by the owner, operator, person-in-charge, or a designated member of the crew.
              (d) Non-rechargeable or non-refillable extinguishers must be inspected and maintained in accordance with NFPA 10; however, the annual maintenance need not be conducted by a certified person and can be conducted by the owner, operator, person-in-charge, or a designated member of the crew.
              (e) The owner or managing operator must provide satisfactory evidence of the required servicing to the marine inspector. If any of the equipment or records has not been properly maintained, a qualified servicing facility must perform the required inspections, maintenance procedures, and hydrostatic pressure tests. A tag issued by a qualified servicing organization, and attached to each extinguisher, may be accepted as evidence that the necessary maintenance procedures have been conducted.

              (f) Vaporizing-liquid type fire extinguishers containing carbon tetrachloride, chlorobromomethane, or other toxic vaporizing liquids are not acceptable as equipment required by this subchapter.
              (g) Portable or semi-portable extinguishers, which are required on their name plates to be protected from freezing, must not be located where freezing temperatures may be expected.
              (h) The use of dry chemical, stored pressure, fire extinguishers not fitted with pressure gauges or indicating devices, manufactured prior to January 1, 1965, may be permitted on motorboats and other vessels so long as such extinguishers are maintained in good and serviceable condition. The following maintenance and inspections are required for such extinguishers:
              (1) When the date on the inspection record tag on the extinguishers shows that 6 months have elapsed since the last weight check ashore, then such extinguishers are no longer accepted as meeting required maintenance conditions until they are reweighed ashore, found to be in a serviceable condition, and within required weight conditions.
              (2) If the weight of the container is 1/4 ounce less than that stamped on the container, it must be serviced.
              (3) If the outer seal or seals (which indicate tampering or use when broken) are not intact, the boarding officer or marine inspector will inspect such extinguishers to see that the frangible disc in the neck of the container is intact; and if such disc is not intact, the container must be serviced.
              (4) If there is evidence of damage, use, or leakage, such as dry chemical powder observed in the nozzle or elsewhere on the extinguisher, the extinguisher must be serviced or replaced.
              (i) Dry chemical extinguishers, stored pressure extinguishers, and fire extinguishers without pressure gauges or indicating devices manufactured after January 1, 1965, cannot be labeled with the marine type label described in 46 CFR 162.028-4. These extinguishers manufactured after January 1, 1965, may be carried onboard motorboats or other vessels as excess equipment.
              (j) Semi-portable extinguishers must be fitted with a suitable hose and nozzle, or other practicable means, so that all portions of the space concerned may be covered.

              (a) You must ensure that your vessel is fitted with a general alarm that:
              (1) Has a contact-maker at the operating station that can notify persons on board in the event of an emergency.
              (2) Is capable of notifying persons in any accommodation, work space, and the engine room.

              (3) Has installed, in the engine room and any other area where background noise makes a general alarm hard to hear, a supplemental flashing red light that is identified with a sign that reads:
              
              
                Attention General Alarm—When Alarm Sounds or Flashes Go to Your Station.
              
              
              (4) Is tested at least once each week.
              (b) You or the operator may use a public-address (PA) system or other means of alerting all persons on your towing vessel instead of a general alarm, if the system—
              (1) Is capable of notifying persons in any accommodation, work space, and the engine room;
              (2) Is tested at least once each week;
              (3) Can be activated from the operating station; and

              § 27.205
              What are the requirements for internal communication systems on towing vessels?
              (a) You must ensure that your vessel is fitted with a communication system between the engine room and the operating station that—
              (1) Consists of either fixed or portable equipment, such as a sound-powered telephone, portable radios, or other reliable method of voice communication, with a main or reserve power supply that is independent of the electrical system on your towing vessel; and
              (2) Provides two-way voice communication and calling between the operating station and either—
              (i) The engine room; or
              (ii) A location immediately adjacent to an exit from the engine room.
              (b) Twin-screw vessels with operating-station control for both engines are not required to have internal communication systems.
              (c) When the operating-station's engine controls and the access to the engine room are within 3 meters (10 feet) of each other and allow unobstructed visual contact between them, direct voice communication is acceptable instead of a communication system.
            
            
              § 27.207
              What are the requirements for fuel shut-offs on towing vessels?
              To stop the flow of fuel in the event of a break in the fuel line, you must have a positive, remote fuel-shut-off valve fitted on any fuel line that supplies fuel directly to an engine or generator. The valve must be near the source of supply (for instance, at the day tank, storage tank, or fuel-distribution manifold). Furthermore, it must be operable from a safe place outside the space where the valve is installed. Each remote valve control should be marked in clearly legible letters, at least 25 millimeters (1 inch) high, indicating the purpose of the valve and the way to operate it.
            
            
              § 27.209
              What are the requirements for training crews to respond to fires?
              (a) Drills and instruction. The master or person in charge of a vessel must ensure that each crewmember participates in drills and receives instruction at least once each month. The instruction may coincide with the drills, but need not. You must ensure that all crewmembers are familiar with their fire-fighting duties, and, specifically, with the following contingencies:
              (1) Fighting a fire in the engine room and elsewhere on board the vessel, including how to—
              (i) Operate all of the fire-extinguishing equipment on board the vessel;
              (ii) Stop any mechanical ventilation system for the engine room and effectively seal all natural openings to the space to prevent leakage of the extinguishing agent; and
              (iii) Operate the fuel shut-off for the engine room.
              (2) Activating the general alarm.
              (3) Reporting inoperative alarm systems and fire-detection systems.

              (b) Alternative form of instruction. The master or person in charge of a vessel may substitute, for the instruction required in paragraph (a) of this section, the viewing of video training materials concerning at least the contingencies listed in paragraph (a), followed by a discussion led by someone familiar with these contingencies. This instruction may occur either on board or off the vessel.
              (c) Participation in drills. Drills must take place on board the vessel, as if there were an actual emergency. They must include—
              (1) Participation by all crewmembers;
              (2) Breaking out and using, or simulating the use of, emergency equipment;
              (3) Testing of all alarm and detection systems; and
              (4) Putting on protective clothing (by at least one person), if the vessel is so equipped.
              (d) Safety orientation. The master or person in charge of a vessel must ensure that each crewmember who has not (i) participated in the drills required by paragraph (a) of this section, and (ii) received the instruction required by that paragraph, receives a safety orientation within 24 hours of reporting for duty.
              (e) The safety orientation must cover the particular contingencies listed in paragraph (a) of this section.

              § 28.120
              Survival craft.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section and 28.305, each vessel must carry the survival craft specified in table 28.120(a), table 28.120(b), or table 28.120(c), as appropriate for the vessel, in an aggregate capacity to accommodate the total number of individuals on board.
              (b) The requirements of this section do not apply to vessels less than 10.97 meters (36 feet) in length with 3 or fewer individuals on board which operate within 12 miles of the coastline.
              (c) A buoyant apparatus may be substituted instead of the requirements in this section for vessels 10.97 meters (36 feet) or more in length with 3 or fewer individuals on board which operate within 12 miles of the coastline.
              (d) Each survival craft installed on board a vessel before September 15, 1991, may continue to be used to meet the requirements of this section provided the survival craft is—
              (1) Of the same type as required in tables 28.120(a), 28.120(b), or 28.120(c), as appropriate for the vessel type; and
              (2) Maintained in good and serviceable condition.
              (e) Each inflatable liferaft installed on board a vessel before September 15, 1991, may continue to be used to meet the requirements for an approved inflatable liferaft, provided the existing liferaft is—
              (1) Maintained in good and serviceable condition as required by table 28.140; and
              (2) Equipped with the equipment pack required by tables 28.120(a), 28.120(b), or 28.120(c), as appropriate for the vessel type. Where no equipment pack is specified in tables 28.120(a), 28.120(b), or 28.120(c), a coastal service pack is the minimum required.
              (f) A lifeboat may be substituted for any survival craft required by this section, provided it is arranged and equipped in accordance with part 199 of this chapter.
              (g) The capacity of an auxiliary craft carried on board a vessel that is integral to and necessary for normal fishing operations will satisfy the requirements of this section for survival craft, except for an inflatable liferaft, provided the craft is readily accessible during an emergency and is capable of safely holding all individuals on board the vessel. If the auxiliary craft is equipped with a Coast Guard required capacity plate, the boat must not be loaded so as to exceed the rated capacity.
              (h) A vessel less than 10.97 meters (36 feet) in length that meets the flotation provisions of 33 CFR part 183 is exempt from the requirement for survival craft in paragraph (a) of this section for operation on—
              (1) Any waters within 12 miles of the coastline.
              (2) Rivers.

              (3) Any portion of the lowest 3 feet (0.91 meters) of the vessel's hull is not more than 6 inches (152 millimeters) below the water's surface as measured at the lowest point on the following—
              (i) The gunwale, for an open boat; or
              (ii) The main deck, for a decked vessel.
              (d) A vessel which is fitted with an outboard engine must be loaded as described in paragraph (f) of this section and must survive the submergence described in paragraph (c) of this section, except that the equilibrium heel angle must not exceed 30° and the vessel must float with the lower end of the vessel not more than 12 inches (0.31 meters) below the water's surface in calm water.
              (e) For the tests described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a vessel must be complete in all respects, except that machinery which would be damaged by water may be replaced with equivalent fixed weight in the same location as the machinery it replaces. The vessel must be loaded with weight to represent the most adverse loading condition. The most adverse loading condition normally includes the maximum weight of fish in its highest possible location. Weights must be substituted for operating personnel at 165 pounds (734 Newtons) per individual and may be substituted for fishing gear. The substitute weights may be located transversely so that the vessel floats level prior to being submerged. The two largest air chambers, or compartments of a decked vessel not used as fuel tanks, that contribute buoyancy to the vessel must be flooded.
              (f) For the test described in paragraph (d) of this section, a vessel must be complete and loaded as described in paragraph (e) of this section, except that the center of gravity of the equivalent maximum fish load must be located to one side of the vessel's centerline by a distance equal to one-fifth of the maximum transverse dimension of the fish storage space.

              § 28.530
              Stability instructions.
              (a) Intent. The intent of this section is to ensure that vessel masters and individuals in charge of vessels are provided with enough stability information to allow them to maintain their vessel in a satisfactory stability condition. The rules provide maximum flexibility for owners and qualified individuals to determine how this information is conveyed, taking into consideration decisions by operating personnel must be made quickly and that few operating personnel in the commercial fishing industry have had specialized training in stability. Therefore, stability instructions should take into account the conditions a vessel may reasonably be expected to encounter and provide simple guidance for the operating personnel to deal with these situations.
              (b) Each vessel must be provided with stability instructions which provide the master or individual in charge of the vessel with loading constraints and operating restrictions which maintain the vessel in a condition which meets the applicable stability requirements of this subpart.
              (c) Stability instructions must be developed by a qualified individual.
              (d) Stability instructions must be in a format easily understood by the master or individual in charge of the vessel. Units of measure, language, and rigor of calculations in the stability instructions must be consistent with the ability of the master or the individual in charge of the vessel. The format of the stability instructions may include, at the owner's discretion, any of the following:
              (1) Simple loading instructions;
              (2) A simple loading diagram with instructions;
              (3) A stability booklet with sample calculations; or
              (4) Any other appropriate format for providing stability instructions.
              (e) Stability instructions must be developed based on the vessel's individual characteristics and may include the following, as appropriate for the format chosen for presentation:
              (1) A general description of the vessel, including lightweight data;
              (2) Instructions on the use of the information;
              (3) General arrangement plans showing watertight compartments, closures, vents, downflooding angles, and allowable weights;
              (4) Loading restrictions, such as diagrams, tables, descriptions or maximum KG curves;
              (5) Sample loading conditions;
              (6) General precautions for preventing unintentional flooding;
              (7) Capacity plan or tank sounding tables showing tank and hold capacities, centers of gravity, and free surface effects;
              (8) A rapid and simple means for evaluating any specific loading condition;
              (9) The amount and location of fixed ballast;
              (10) Any other necessary guidance for maintaining adequate stability under normal and emergency conditions;
              (11) A general description of the stability criteria that are used in developing the instructions;
              (12) Guidance on the use of roll limitation devices such as stabilizers; and
              (13) Any other information the owner feels is important to the stability and operation of the vessel.
            
            
              § 28.535
              Inclining test.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, each vessel for which the lightweight displacement and centers of gravity must be determined in order to do the calculations required in this subpart must have an inclining test performed.
              (b) A deadweight survey may be substituted for the inclining test, if there is a record of an inclining test of a sister vessel. A vessel qualifies as a sister vessel if it is built to the same basic drawings and the undocumented weight difference between the two vessels is less than 3 percent of the lightweight displacement of the vessel which was inclined and the location of the longitudinal center of gravity differs less than 1 percent of the vessel's length.

              (c) A deadweight survey may be substituted for the inclining test, or the inclining test may be dispensed with, if an accurate estimate of the vessel's lightweight characteristics can be made and the precise location of the position of the vessel's vertical center of gravity is not necessary to ensure that the vessel has adequate stability in all probable loading conditions.
              (d) ASTM F 1321 (incorporated by reference, see § 28.40), with the exception of Annexes A and B, may be used as guidance for any inclining test or deadweight survey conducted under this section.

              Free surface.
              (a) When doing the stability calculations required by this subpart, the virtual rise in the vessel's vertical center of gravity due to liquids in tanks must be considered by calculating the following—
              (1) For each type of consumable liquid, the maximum free surface effect of a tank, or a transverse pair of tanks, having the greatest free surface effect, in addition to a correction for service tanks; and
              (2) The free surface effect of each partially filled tank and hold containing a liquid that is not a consumable or containing fish or a fish product that can shift as the vessel heels. This should include correction for any loose water within the vessel's hull associated with the processing of fish.
              (b) The free surface effect of tanks fitted with cross connection piping must be calculated assuming the tanks are one common tank, unless valves that will be kept closed to prevent the transfer of liquids as the vessel heels are installed in the piping.
              (c) The moment of transference method may be used in lieu of the inertia method when calculating free surface effects.
            
            
              § 28.545
              Intact stability when using lifting gear.
              (a) Each vessel which lifts a weight over the side, or that uses fishing gear that can impose an overturning moment on the vessel, such as trawls and seines, must meet the requirements of this section if that maximum heeling moment exceeds 0.67(W)(GM)(F/B), in foot-long tons (meter-metric tons), where:
              W = displacement of the vessel with the lifted weight or the force on the fishing gear included, in long tons (metric tons);
              GM = metacentric height with the lifted weight or force on the fishing gear included, in feet (meters);
              F = freeboard to the lowest weather deck, measured at amidships in feet (meters); and
              B = maximum beam, in feet (meters).
              (b) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, each vessel must meet the requirements of § 28.570 or have at least 15 foot-degrees (0.080 meter-radians) of area under the righting arm curve, after correcting the righting arms for the heeling arm caused by lifting or fishing gear, from the angle of equilibrium to the least of the following:
              (1) The angle corresponding to the maximum righting arm;
              (2) The angle of downflooding; or
              (3) 40° (0.7 radians).
              (c) The angle of intersection of the heeling arm curve resulting from the lifting moment or the moment of fishing gear and the righting arm curve must not be at an angle of more than 10° (0.17 radians).
              (d) The heeling arm curve resulting from lifting must be calculated as the resultant of the upright heeling moment divided by the vessel's displacement multiplied by the cosine of the angle of heel.
              (e) For the purposes of this section, the weight of suspended loads must be assumed to act at the tip of the boom unless the suspended load's transverse movement is restricted, such as by the use of sideboards.
              (f) A vessel that operates on protected waters, as defined in § 170.050 of this chapter, must comply with the requirements of this section, except that the area described in paragraph (b) of this section must be at least 10 foot-degrees (0.053 meter-radians).
            
            
              § 28.550
              Icing.
              (a) Applicability. Each vessel that operates north of 42° North latitude between November 15 and April 15 or south of 42° South latitude between April 15 and November 15 must meet the requirements of this section.

              (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the weight of assumed ice on each surface above the waterline of a vessel which operates north of 66°30′ North latitude or south of 66° South latitude must be assumed to be at least:
              (1) 6.14 pounds per square foot (30 Kilograms per square meter) of horizontal projected area which corresponds to a thickness of 1.3 inches (33 millimeters); and
              (2) 3.07 pounds per square foot (15 Kilograms per square meter) of vertical projected area which corresponds to a thickness of 0.65 inches (16.5 millimeters).
              (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the weight of assumed ice on a vessel that operates north of 42° North but south of 66°30′ North latitude or south of 42° South but north of 66° South latitude must be assumed to be at least one-half of the values required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
              (d) The height of the center of gravity of the accumulated ice should be calculated according to the position of each corresponding horizontal surface (deck and gangway) and each other continuous surface on which ice can reasonably be expected to accumulate. The projected horizontal and vertical area of each small discontinuous surface such as a rail, a spar, and rigging with no sail can be accounted for by increasing the calculated area by 15 percent.
              (e) The weight and location of ice must be included in the vessel's weight and centers of gravity in each condition of loading when performing the stability calculations required by this subpart.

              § 28.555
              Freeing ports.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, each decked vessel fitted with bulwarks must be fitted with freeing ports.
              (b) Freeing ports must be located to allow the rapid clearing of water in all probable conditions of list and trim.

The length of the bulwark need not exceed 0.7 times the overall length of the vessel.

              (e) For a bulwark more than 4 feet (1.22 meters) in height, the freeing port area required by paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section must be increased in accordance with the following formula:
              
              i = [h − 4]0.04q, (i = [h − 1.722].04q, for metric units), where:
              
              
                i = increase in freeing port area, in square feet (square meters);

                q = length of bulwark exceeding 4 feet (1.22 meters) in height, in feet (meters).
              
              

              (f) For a bulwark less than 3 feet (0.91 meters) in height, the required freeing port area, required by paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, may be decreased in accordance with the following formula:
              
              r = [3 − h]0.04q, (r = [h − 0.91 − h]0.04q), where:
              
              
                r = permitted reduction in freeing port area, in square feet (square meters).
                h = bulwark height, in feet (meters).
                q = length of bulwark which is less than 3 feet (0.914 meters) in height, in feet (meters).
              
              
              (g) For a vessel without sheer, the freeing port area must be increased by 50 percent.
              (h) The area of the freeing ports on a vessel that operates on protected waters need only be 50 percent of the area required by paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section.

              (i) Freeing port covers are permitted provided that the freeing port area required by this section is not diminished and the covers are constructed and fitted so that water will readily flow outboard but not inboard.

              (f) Each window and portlight located below the first deck above the lowest weather deck must be provided with an inside deadlight. Each deadlight must be efficient, hinged, and arranged so that it can be effectively closed watertight.
              (g) An opening in a vessel below the weather deck which is used for discharging water or debris resulting from processing or sorting operations must be fitted with a means to ensure the opening can be closed weathertight. This means of closing must be operable from a location which is outside the space containing the opening.

              (1) The deck well is filled to the top of the bulwark at its lowest point and the vessel heeled to the angle at which this point is immersed;
              (2) Water does not run off through the freeing ports;
              (3) Vessel trim and displacement are constant and equal to the values of the vessel without the water on deck; and
              (4) Water in the well is free to run-off over the top of the bulwark.
              (d) The residual righting energy is the righting energy from the value where the righting arm equals the water on deck heeling arm up to the lesser of the values of 40° (0.70 radians) of heel or the downflooding angle.

              (7) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, positive righting arms through an angle of heel of 60° (1.05 radians).
              (b) In lieu of meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(7) of this section, a vessel may comply with the following provisions:
              (1) Hatches in the watertight/weathertight envelope must be normally kept closed at sea (e.g., the live tank hatch is only opened intermittently, under controlled conditions); or
              (2) Unintentional flooding through these hatches must not result in progressive flooding to other spaces; and

              (3) In all cases, a vessel must have positive righting arms through an angle of heel of at least 50° (0.87 radians) and the intact stability analysis must consider that spaces accessed by such hatches to be flooded full or flooded to the level having the most detrimental effect on stability when free surface effects are considered.

              § 28.580
              Unintentional flooding.
              (a) Applicability. Except for an open boat that operates on protected waters and as provided by paragraph (i) of this section, each vessel built on or after September 15, 1991 must comply with the requirements of this section.
              
              (b) Collision bulkhead. A watertight collision bulkhead must be fitted and must meet the following:
              (1) Openings in the collision bulkhead must be kept to a minimum, and each must be fitted with a watertight closure device;
              (2) A collision bulkhead must not be fitted with a door below the bulkhead deck;
              (3) A penetration or opening in a collision bulkhead must be—
              (i) Located as high and as far inboard as practicable; and
              (ii) Fitted with a means to rapidly make it watertight which is operable from a location aft of the collision bulkhead;
              (4) The collision bulkhead must be located at least 5 percent of the length from the forward perpendicular unless the vessel has a bulbous bow, in which case the forward reference point will be extended by half the distance between the vessel's forward perpendicular and the forwardmost point of the bulbous bow as shown in figure 28.580; and
              (5) The collision bulkhead must not be stepped below the bulkhead deck.
              (c) Each vessel must meet the survival conditions in paragraph (f) of this section in each condition of loading and operation with the extent and character of damage specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
              (d) Extent and character of damage. Except where a lesser extent of damage or a smaller penetration would be more disabling, in evaluating the damage stability of a vessel the following penetration must be assumed:
              (1) Longitudinal extent—L/10, or 10 feet (3.05 meters) plus 0.03L, whichever is less. Transverse watertight bulkheads that are separated by at least this distance may be assumed to remain effective;
              (2) Transverse extent—30 inches (0.76 meters) from the side measured at right angles to the centerline at the level of the deepest operating waterline; and
              (3) Vertical extent—from the baseline upward without limit.
              (e) Each space containing a through hull fitting, such as the lazarette and the engineroom, must be assumed to be flooded.
              (f) Survival conditions. A vessel is presumed to survive the assumed damage and unintentional flooding described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section if:
              (1) The angle of equilibrium after flooding does not exceed 25° (0.44 radians); and
              (2) Through an angle of 20° (0.35 radians) beyond the angle of equilibrium after flooding, the following are met—
              (i) The righting arm curve is positive;
              (ii) The maximum righting arm is at least 4 inches (102 millimeters);
              (iii) Each submerged opening is capable of being made weathertight; and
              (iv) The heeling arm caused by deploying all fully loaded davit-launched survival craft on one side of a vessel does not exceed the righting arm at any angle of heel beyond the equilibrium angle when launching is assumed on the damaged side.
              (g) Permeability. The permeability of each space must not be less than the following:
              (1) For an accommodations space—95 percent;
              (2) For a propulsion machinery space—85 percent;
              (3) For a tightly packed storage space—60 percent;
              (4) For a void or an auxiliary machinery space—95 percent;
              (5) For an empty fish hold—95 percent;
              (6) For a full fish hold—50 percent; and
              (7) For tanks—95 percent (less if a tank must be full to attain the draft under consideration.)
              (h) Buoyancy of superstructure. A deckhouse or a superstructure may be included in the buoyant volume of a vessel provided it is:
              (1) Sufficiently strong to withstand the impact of waves;
              (2) Fitted with a weathertight or watertight closure device for each opening;
              (3) Equipped with an efficient, hinged, inside deadlight, for each window and each portlight, arranged so that it can be effectively closed watertight; and
              (4) Fitted with interior access from the spaces below.

              (i) A vessel may obtain and maintain a Load Line Certificate under subchapter E of this chapter in lieu of meeting the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.

              § 28.805
              Launching of survival craft.
              In addition to the survival craft requirements in subpart B, each vessel must have a gate or other opening in the deck rails, lifelines, or bulwarks adjacent to the stowage location of each survival craft which has a mass of more than 50 kilograms (110 pounds), so that the survival craft can be manually launched.
            
            
              
              § 28.810
              Deck rails, lifelines, storm rails and hand grabs.
              (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, deck rails, lifelines, grab rails, or equivalent protection must be installed near the periphery of all weather decks accessible to individuals. Where space limitations make deck rails impractical, hand grabs may be substituted.

            Subpart I—Citizenship Waiver Procedures

              § 28.1100
              General.

              (a) As set forth in 46 U.S.C. 8103, a citizenship requirement, other than a requirement that applies to the master of a documented vessel, on commercial fishing vessels may be waived for unlicensed seamen when qualified seamen who are citizens of the United States are not available. Under the provisions of this subpart, the Coast Guard approves or denies requests for a waiver of the citizenship requirement from owners, operators, or employers seeking to exceed the 25 percent limit applicable to unlicensed seamen aboard fishing industry vessels who are non-permanent resident aliens authorized for employment in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.).
              (b) This subpart does not apply to a fishing vessel fishing exclusively for highly migratory species (as that term is defined in section 3 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802)).
              (c) The regulations in this subpart have preemptive effect over State or local regulation within the same field.
            
            
              § 28.1105
              Request for a waiver.
              (a) Vessel owners, operators, or employers who desire a waiver of citizenship requirements from the Coast Guard must submit a written request to the Commandant (CG-CVC), United States Coast Guard Headquarters, Stop 7501, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7501.
              (b) The written request required under paragraph (a) of this section must contain—
              (1) The vessel owner's, operator's, or employer's contact information—
              (i) Full name (last, first, middle initial);
              (ii) Address;
              (iii) Work phone number;
              (iv) Fax number (if applicable); and
              (v) Email address (if applicable);
              (2) Information on fishing vessel(s) for which the owner, operator, or employer requests a citizenship waiver. For each listed vessel, the owner's, operator's, or employer's must include—
              (i) Fishing vessel name;
              (ii) Fishing vessel official number;
              (iii) Fishing vessel length (in feet);
              (iv) Fishing vessel gross tonnage; and
              (v) Each type of fishery in which the vessel is engaged;
              (3) Information on persons who will work on the vessel. For each listed vessel, the owner, operator, or employer must include—
              (i) The total number of unlicensed crew normally employed;
              (ii) The name, nationality, birth place, position to be held, and basis for employment authorization in the United States of each alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence but is otherwise authorized for employment in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA); and
              (iii) The number of alien seamen who are not lawfully admitted for permanent residence but are otherwise authorized for employment in the United States under the INA for which the waiver is requested; and
              (4) The time period over which the 25 percent limit will be exceeded—
              (i) Start date (MM/DD/YYYY); and
              (ii) Expiration date (MM/DD/YYYY).
              (c) The owner, operator, or employer submitting a request for a waiver under paragraph (a) of this section must include a statement certifying that the vessel(s) will operate in compliance with all other applicable citizenship requirements regarding the master or other officers in charge of deck or engineering watches on U.S.-documented vessels.

              (d) The owner, operator, or employer submitting a request for a waiver under paragraph (a) of this section must provide evidence that aliens who are not lawfully admitted for permanent residence are authorized for employment with the owner, operator, or employer under the INA and evidence that qualified seamen who are U.S. citizens are not available for employment. The following documentation for H2B non-immigrants is satisfactory evidence both of authorization for employment with the owner, operator, or employer under the INA and that qualified seamen who are U.S. citizens are not available:
              (1) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-797, “Notice of Action: Approval Notice” classifying the alien as an H2B non-immigrant for purposes of employment with the owner, operator, or employer submitting a request for a waiver under paragraph (a) of this section.
              (2) USCIS Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record” indicating that the alien has been lawfully admitted to the United States (or has been lawfully granted a change of nonimmigrant status or extension of non-immigrant stay in H2B classification) for the dates covered by the proposed employment.
              (e) Upon receipt of a request submitted under paragraph (a) of this section and required information submitted in accordance with paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the Coast Guard will evaluate the information and may investigate further, as necessary, to determine the validity of the information provided.

              (a)(1) If, within 30 days of receipt of a properly submitted request for a waiver, the Coast Guard does not make a determination whether to approve the request or does not advise the owner, operator, or employer that additional time is needed for consideration, the request will be considered provisionally approved for 90 days from the end of that 30-day period.
              (2) If the Coast Guard does not make a determination whether to approve a properly submitted request for a waiver in writing within 30 days of receipt, the owner, operator, or employer must have a copy of the request and supporting documentation available on board the vessel as proof of submission of a request for waiver of the citizenship requirement for unlicensed seamen for that vessel.
              (b)(1) If the Coast Guard determines, based on the waiver request, supporting documentation, and any other relevant information, that no qualified U.S. citizen seamen are available, the Coast Guard will grant the waiver to exceed the 25-percent limit for employment of non-permanent resident alien seaman for the period of employment authorized for each alien under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The Coast Guard will issue a letter of approval to the owner, operator, or employer for the applicable vessel(s).
              (2) The owner, operator, or employer must have a copy of the waiver approval letter available on board the vessel as proof of waiver of the citizenship requirement for unlicensed seamen for that vessel.

              (a) All tank vessels, except unmanned tank barges, contracted for on or after July 1, 1969, shall have efficient guard rails or bulwarks on decks and bridges. The height of rails or bulwarks shall be at least 391/2 inches from the deck except that where this height would interfere with the normal operation of the vessel, a lesser height may be approved by the Commandant. At exposed peripheries of the freeboard and superstructure decks the rails shall be in at least three courses including the top. The opening below the lowest course shall not be more than 9 inches. The courses shall not be more than 15 inches apart. In the case of ships with rounded gunwales, the guard rail supports shall be placed on the flat of the deck. On other decks and bridges the rails shall be in at least two courses, including the top, approximately evenly spaced. All rails shall consist of solid or tubular sections or chains or wire rope or a combination thereof.
              (b) Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that a vessel is engaged exclusively on voyages of a sheltered nature, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be relaxed.
              (c) Tank vessels contracted for prior to July 1, 1969, except unmanned tank barges, assigned a deeper load line under part 42 of subchapter E (Load Lines) of this chapter shall have efficient guard rails or bulwarks as required by paragraph (a) of this section. Otherwise, existing rails and bulwarks previously approved will be considered satisfactory so long as they are maintained in good condition. Minor repairs and alterations may be made to the same standards as the original construction.

              (d) All tank vessels in ocean and coastwise service, except unmanned tank barges, constructed on or after June 15, 1987, must have suitable storm rails installed in all passageways and at the deckhouse sides on weather decks where persons on board might have normal access. Storm rails must be installed on both sides of passageways which are six feet or more in width. Tank vessels to which this paragraph applies constructed prior to June 15, 1987, may retain previously accepted or approved installations so long as they are maintained in good condition to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.

              Draft marks and draft indicating systems—TB/ALL.
              (a) All vessels must have draft marks plainly and legibly visible upon the stem and upon the sternpost or rudderpost or at any place at the stern of the vessel as may be necessary for easy observance. The bottom of each mark must indicate the draft.
              (b) The draft must be taken from the bottom of the keel to the surface of the water at the location of the marks.
              (c) In cases where the keel does not extend forward or aft to the location of the draft marks, due to raked stem or cutaway skeg, the datum line from which the drafts shall be taken, shall be obtained by projecting the line of the bottom of the keel forward or aft, as the case may be, to the location of the draft marks.
              (d) In cases where a vessel may have a skeg or other appendage extending locally below the line of the keel, the draft at the end of the vessel adjacent to such appendage shall be measured to a line tangent to the lowest part of such appendage and parallel to the line of the bottom of the keel.
              (e) Draft marks must be separated so that the projections of the marks onto a vertical plane are of uniform height equal to the vertical spacing between consecutive marks.
              (f) Draft marks must be painted in contrasting color to the hull.
              (g) In cases where draft marks are obscured due to operational constraints or by protrusions, the vessel must be fitted with a reliable draft indicating system from which the bow and stern drafts can be determined.

                  0 minutes with no insulation requirement
                
              
              (c) “B” Class bulkheads. Bulkheads of the “B” Class shall be constructed with approved incombustible materials and made intact from deck to deck and to shell or other boundaries. They shall be so constructed that, if subjected to the standard fire test, they would be capable of preventing the passage of flame for one-half hour.
              (d) “C” Class divisions. Bulkheads or decks of the “C” Class shall be constructed of approved incombustible materials, but need meet no requirements relative to the passage of flame.
              (e) Steel. Where the term “steel or other equivalent metal” is used in this subpart, it is intended to require a material which, by itself or due to insulation provided, has structural and integrity qualities equivalent to steel at the end of the applicable fire exposure.
              (f) Approved material. Where in this subpart approved materials are required, they refer to materials approved under the applicable subparts of subchapter Q (Specifications) of this chapter, as follows:

              (a) Cargo pumps. In tank vessels carrying Grade A, B, C, or D liquid cargo, cargo pumps shall be isolated from source of vapor ignition by gastight bulkheads. A gastight bulkhead between the pumproom and the pump engine room may be pierced for drive shaft and pump engine control rods provided such openings are fitted with stuffing boxes or other approved gland arrangement. A steam driven pump shall not be considered a source of vapor ignition provided the steam temperature does not exceed 500 °F.
              (b) Ventilation for pumprooms on tank vessels the construction or conversion of which is started between July 1, 1951, and January 1, 1963. (1) Pumprooms of all tank vessels, the construction or conversion of which is started between July 1, 1951, and January 1, 1963, shall be ventilated in such a way as to remove vapors from points near the floor level or bilges. Pumprooms on tankships handling Grade A, B, or C liquid cargo, with machinery located below the freeboard deck, shall be equipped with power ventilation. Pumprooms equipped with power ventilation shall have the ventilation outlets terminate more than six feet from any opening to the interior part of the vessel which normally contains sources of vapor ignition.
              (2) For all tank vessels, the construction or conversion of which is started between October 1, 1959, and January 1, 1963, the power ventilation shall not produce a source of vapor ignition in either the pumproom or the ventilation systems associated with the pumproom. The capacity of power ventilation units shall be sufficient to effect a complete change of air in not more than 3 minutes, based upon the volume of the pumproom and associated trunks up to the deck at which access from the weather is provided.
              (c) Ventilation for pumprooms on tank vessels the construction or conversion of which is started on or after January 1, 1963. (1) For all tank vessels, the construction or conversion of which is started on or after January 1, 1963, the cargo pumprooms shall be fitted in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section. Cargo pumprooms on these vessels shall be ventilated in such a way as to remove vapors from points near the floor level or bilges. Cargo pumprooms on tank vessels handling Grade A, B, or C liquid cargo, shall be equipped with power ventilation of the exhaust type having capacity sufficient to effect a complete change of air in not more than 3 minutes based upon the volume of the pumproom and associated trunks up to the deck at which access from the weather is provided.
              (2) The power ventilation units shall not produce a source of vapor ignition in either the pumproom or the ventilation systems associated with the pumproom. Inlets to exhaust ducts shall be provided and located near the floor level at points where concentrations of vapors may be expected. Ventilation from the weather deck shall be provided. Power supply ventilation may be fitted in lieu of natural ventilation, but when fitted shall be arranged to avoid turbulence in the cargo pumproom. Cargo pumprooms equipped with power ventilation shall have the ventilation outlets terminate more than 6 feet from any opening to the interior part of the vessel which normally contains sources of vapor ignition, and shall be so located as to minimize the possibility of recirculating contaminated air through the pumproom.
              (3) Cargo pumprooms handling Grade D and/or E liquid cargo only shall be fitted with at least two ducts extended to the weather deck, one of which shall be extended to a point near the floor level. This does not preclude installation of power ventilation, if desired.
              (4) The ventilation required in this paragraph shall be sufficient to properly ventilate the pumproom with the access openings closed.
              (d) Access. The access to a cargo pumproom in a tank vessel carrying Grade A, B, C, or D liquid cargo shall be from the open deck.

              § 32.63-1
              Application—B/ALL.
              (a) The requirements of this subpart shall apply to all tank barges, the construction or conversion of which is started on or after July 1, 1964, and carrying those cargoes listed in table 30.25-1 which are defined as:
              (1) Flammable liquids having a Reid vapor pressure in excess of 25 pounds per square inch, absolute, in independent tanks (part 32).
              (2) Liquefied flammable gases (part 38 of this subchapter).

              § 32.63-5
              Barge hull classifications—B/ALL.
              (a) Each barge subject to the provision of this subpart shall be assigned a hull type number. The Commandant will designate the barge hull types to be used for carrying cargoes in order to insure that the vessel is designed consistent with the degree and nature of the hazard of the commodity carried.
              (b) For this purpose the barge hull types shall be as follows:
              (1) Type I barge hull. Barge hulls classed as Type I are those designed to carry products which require the maximum preventive measures to preclude the uncontrolled release of the cargo to the waterways and/or atmosphere.
              (2) Type II barge hull. Barge hulls classed as Type II are those designed to carry products which require substantial preventive measures to preclude uncontrolled release to the atmosphere, but whose uncontrolled release to the waterways does not constitute a longlasting public or operating personnel hazard, though local and temporary pollution may occur.
              (3) Type III barge hull. Barge hulls classed as Type III are those designed to carry products of sufficient hazard to require a moderate degree of control.
            
            
              § 32.63-8
              Alternative arrangements—B/ALL.
              (a) Alternative arrangements, differing from those specifically required by this subpart, may be considered and approved by the Commandant, if it is demonstrated to his satisfaction that a degree of safety is obtained which is consistent with the intent of this subpart.
            
            
              
              § 32.63-10
              Rakes and coamings—B/ALL.
              (a) Each barge hull shall be constructed with a suitable blow form (length, shape, and height of headlog) to protect against diving at the maximum speed at which the barge is designed to be towed. In any integrated tow, only the lead barge need comply with this requirement. In any case, the operator of the towing vessel shall be guided by appropriate speed limitations.
              (b) All open hopper type barge hulls shall be provided with coamings around the hopper space and, additionally, a 36-inch minimum height plowshare breakwater on the forward rake. Coamings shall have a minimum height of 36 inches forward graduated to a minimum height of 24 inches at midlength and 18 inches thereafter.
            
            
              § 32.63-20
              Hull structure—B/ALL.
              (a) General. In addition to complying with the requirements of § 32.60-1, as applicable, barge hulls of Types I and II shall comply with the provisions of this section.
              (b) Types I and II barge hull. Under an assumed grounding condition such that the forward rake bulkhead rests upon a pinnacle at the water surface, the maximum hull bending stress shall not exceed the following limits:
              (1) Independent tanks may be installed in such a manner that they do not contribute to the strength and stiffness of the barge. In such case, the hull stress shall not exceed either 50 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the material or 70 percent of the yield strength when specified, whichever is greater.
              (2) The Commandant may consider a reduction in hull stress when independent tanks are installed in such a manner as to contribute to the strength and stiffness of the barge and this is accounted for in determining the effective section modulus of the barge. In such case, the hull stress shall not exceed the percentage stress values prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section multiplied by the quantity (1.5−SWT/UTS), where SWT is the stress calculated without including the effect of the tanks, and UTS is the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the material. The value SWT, however, shall in no case be more than 75 percent of UTS.
            
            
              § 32.63-25
              Cargo tanks and supports—B/ALL.
              (a) General. Saddles and hold-down securing straps for independent cargo tanks shall be designed to prevent tank failure due to loads induced in the saddles or straps by barge deflection.
              (b) Collision protection. (1) All independent cargo tanks installed on Type I and Type II barge hulls shall be protected with suitable collision chocks or collision straps to withstand a longitudinal collision load of one and one-half times the weight of the tank and cargo. All other independent cargo tanks shall be provided with suitable collision chocks or collision straps to withstand a longitudinal collision load equal to the weight of the tank and cargo.
              (2) All cargo tanks shall be so located as to reduce the likelihood of their being damaged in the event of collision. This protection shall be obtained by locating the cargo tanks not less than 4 feet from the side shell and box-end for Type I hulls and 3 feet for Type II barge hulls, and not less than 25 feet from the headlog at the bow for both types.
              (c) Cargo tank design—(1) Types I and II barge hulls. (i) In addition to requirements provided for in applicable regulations for a specific commodity, cargoes subject to the provisions of this subpart shall be transported in cargo tanks meeting the requirements of this paragraph. Pressure vessel-type cargo tanks shall have sufficient additional strength so as to limit the maximum combined tank stress, including saddle horn and bending stresses, to 1.5 times the maximum allowable hoop stress in still water, and to the yield strength of the tank material or 70 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the tank material, if less, in the grounded condition as required by § 32.63-20(b).

              (ii) Gravity type cargo tanks shall have sufficient additional strength to limit the maximum combined tank stress, including saddle horn and bending stresses, to the yield strength of the tank material or 70 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the tank material, if less, in the grounded condition as required by § 32.63-20(b).
              (2) Type III barge hulls. In addition to the requirements of this paragraph, pressure vessel-type cargo tanks shall have sufficient additional strength so as to limit the maximum combined stress, including saddle horn and bending stresses, to 1.5 times the maximum allowable hoop stress.

              (b) Each pump shall be capable of delivering simultaneously the number of streams of water required by table 34.10-5(a) from the outlets having the greatest pressure drop between fire pump(s) and nozzles at a Pitot tube pressure of approximately 75 p.s.i. Where 11/2-inch hose is permitted in lieu of 21/2-inch hose by footnote 3 of table 34.10-5(a), the pump capacity shall be determined on the basis that both hoses are used.
              (c) On tankships of 1,000 gross tons and over on an international voyage, each required fire pump, while delivering water through the fire main system at a pressure corresponding to that required by § 34.10-15(e), shall have a minimum capacity of at least two-thirds of that required for an independent bilge pump if no length correction is taken for the cargo tank space. However, in no case shall the capacity of each fire pump be less than that otherwise required by this section.

              (d) Fire pumps shall be fitted on the discharge side with relief valves set to relieve at 25 p.s.i. in excess of the pressure necessary to maintain the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
              (e) Fire pumps shall be fitted with a pressure gage on the discharge side of the pumps.
              (f) Fire pumps may be used for other purposes provided at least one of the required pumps is kept available for use on the fire system at all times. In no case shall a pump having connection to an oil line be used as a fire pump. Branch lines connected to the fire main for purposes other than fire and deck wash shall be arranged so that the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and any other services installed on the fire main can be met simultaneously.
              (g) On all vessels where two fire pumps are required, they shall be located in separate spaces, and the arrangement of pumps, sea connections, and sources of power shall be such as to insure that a fire in any one space will not put all of the fire pumps out of operation. However, where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that it is unreasonable or impracticable to meet this requirement due to the size, or arrangement of the vessel, or for other reasons, the installation of a total flooding carbon dioxide system may be accepted as an alternate method of extinguishing any fire which would affect the powering and operation of at least one of the required fire pumps.

              (a) The size of fire station hydrants and hose required shall be as noted in table 34.10-5(a).
              (b) Fire hydrants shall be of sufficient number and so located that any part of living quarters, storerooms, working spaces and weather decks accessible to crew while at sea may be reached with two effective spray patterns of water, one of which shall be from a single 50-foot length of hose. In main machinery spaces all portions of such spaces shall be capable of being reached by at least 2 effective spray patterns of water, each of which shall be from a single 50-foot length of hose from separate outlets.
              (c) The outlets at the fire station hydrant shall be limited to any position from the horizontal to the vertical pointing downward so that hose will lead horizontally or downward to minimize possibility of kinking.
              (d) All fire station hydrants shall be equipped with spanners suitable for use on the hose at that station.
              (e) Each fire station hydrant must have at least 1 length of firehose. Each firehose on the hydrant must have a combination solid stream and water spray firehose nozzle that meets the requirements in subpart 162.027 of this chapter. Firehose nozzles previously approved under subpart 162.027 of this chapter may be retained so long as they are maintained in good condition to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. A suitable hose rack or other device must be provided. Hose racks on weather decks must be located to afford protection from heavy seas. The hose must be stored in a location that is readily visible.

              (g) The pipes and fire station hydrants shall be so placed that the fire hose may be easily coupled to them. All hydrants shall be so located as to be readily accessible. If deck cargo is carried, it shall not interfere with access to the fire station hydrants, and the pipes shall be arranged as far as practicable to avoid risk of damage by such cargo.

              (h) Each fire station hydrant or “y” branch shall be equipped with a valve so that the hose may be removed while there is pressure on the fire main.
              (i) Fire station hydrant connections shall be brass, bronze, or other equivalent metal. Couplings shall either:
              (1) Use National Standard fire hose coupling threads for the 11/2 inch (38 millimeter) and 21/2 inch (64 millimeter) hose sizes, i.e. 9 threads per inch for 11/2 inch hose, and 71/2 threads per inch for 21/2 inch hose; or
              (2) Be a uniform design for each hose diameter throughout the vessel.
              (j) Fire hose shall be 50 feet in length except on weather decks the hose shall be increased in length if necessary to enable a single length to be goose-necked over each side of the vessel. If two fire mains are installed on the weather decks, the length of hose shall be such that it may be goose-necked over the side from the nearest fire main.
              (k) Fire hose when part of the fire equipment shall not be used for any other purpose than fire extinguishing, fire drills, and testing.
              (l) Fire hose shall be connected to outlets at all times. However, in heavy weather on open decks where no protection is afforded the hose may be removed temporarily from the hydrant and stowed in an accessible location nearby. While in port, fire hose in way of cargo area shall be kept ready for immediate use. The fire hose may be temporarily removed when it will interfere with the handling of cargo.
              (m) Each section of fire hose used after January 1, 1980 must be lined commercial fire hose that conforms to Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc. Standard 19 or Federal Specification ZZ-H-451E. Hose that bears the label of Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc. as lined fire hose is accepted as conforming to this requirement. Each section of replacement fire hose or any section of new fire hose placed aboard a vessel after January 1, 1977 must also conform to the specification required by this paragraph.
              (n) Coupling shall conform to the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
              (o) Each low-velocity water spray applicator under paragraph (f) of this section must have fixed brackets, hooks, or other means for stowing next to the hydrant.

              Quantity, pipe sizes, and discharge rates—T/ALL.
              (a) General. (1) The amount of carbon dioxide required for each space shall be as determined by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
              (b) Total available supply. (1) A separate supply of carbon dioxide need not be provided for each space protected. The total available supply shall be at least sufficient for the space requiring the greatest amount.
              (c) Dry cargo spaces. (1) The number of pounds of carbon dioxide required for each space shall be equal to the gross volume of the space in cubic feet divided by 30.
              (2) Although separate piping shall be led to each cargo hold and 'tween deck, for the purpose of determining the amount of carbon dioxide required, a cargo compartment will be considered as the space between watertight or firescreen bulkheads and from the tank top or lowest deck to the deck head of the uppermost space on which cargo may be carried. If a trunk extends beyond such deck, the trunk volume shall be included. Tonnage openings shall be considered as sealed for this purpose.
              (3) Branch lines to the various cargo holds and 'tween decks shall not be less than 3/4-inch standard pipe size.
              (4) No specific discharge rate need be applied to such systems.
              (d) Machinery spaces, pumprooms, paint lockers, and similar spaces. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the number of pounds of carbon dioxide required for each space shall be equal to the gross volume of the space divided by the appropriate factor noted in table 34.15-5(d)(1). If fuel can drain from the compartment being protected to an adjacent compartment, or if the compartments are not entirely separate, the requirements for both compartments shall be used to determine the amount of carbon dioxide to be provided. The carbon dioxide shall be arranged to discharge into both such compartments simultaneously.

              Controls—T/ALL.
              (a) Except as noted in § 34.15-20(b), all controls and valves for the operation of the system shall be outside the space protected, and shall not be located in any space that might be cut off or made inaccessible in the event of fire in any of the spaces protected.

              (b) If the same cylinders are used to protect more than one space, a manifold with normally closed stop valves shall be used to direct the carbon dioxide into the proper space. If cylinders are used to protect only one space, a normally closed stop valve shall be installed between the cylinders and the space except for systems of the type indicated in § 34.15-5(d) which contain not more than 300 pounds of carbon dioxide.
              
              (c) Distribution piping to the dry cargo spaces shall be controlled from not more than two stations. One of the stations controlling the system for the main machinery space shall be located as convenient as practicable to one of the main-escapes from the space. All control stations and the individual valves and controls shall be marked as required by § 35.40-10 of the subchapter.
              (d) Systems of the type indicated in § 34.15-5(d) shall be actuated at each station by one control operating the valve to the space and a separate control releasing at least the required amount of carbon dioxide. These two controls shall be located in a box or other enclosure clearly identified for the particular space. Systems installed without a stop valve shall be operated by one control releasing at least the required amount of carbon dioxide.
              (e) Where provisions are made for the simultaneous release of a given amount of carbon dioxide by operation of a remote control, provisions shall also be made for manual control at the cylinders. Where gas pressure from pilot cylinders is used as a means for releasing the remaining cylinders, not less than two pilot cylinders shall be used for systems consisting of more than two cylinders. Each of the pilot cylinders shall be capable of manual control at the cylinder, but the remaining cylinders need not be capable of individual manual control.
              (f) Systems of the type indicated in § 34.15-5(d), which are of more than 300 pounds of carbon dioxide shall be fitted with an approved delayed discharge so arranged that the alarm will be sounded for at least 20 seconds before the carbon dioxide is released into the space. Such systems of not more than 300 pounds of carbon dioxide shall also have a similar delayed discharge, except for spaces which have a suitable horizontal escape.
              (g) All distribution valves and controls shall be of an approved type. All controls shall be suitably protected.

              (h) Complete but simple instructions for the operation of the systems must be located in a conspicuous place at or near all pull boxes, stop valve controls and in the CO2 cylinder storage room. On systems in which the CO2 cylinders are not within the protected space, these instructions must also include a schematic diagram of the system and instructions detailing alternate methods of discharging the system should the manual release or stop valve controls fail to operate. Each control valve to branch lines must be marked to indicate the related space served.
              (i) If the space or enclosure containing the carbon dioxide supply or controls is to be locked, a key to the space or enclosure shall be in a break-glass-type box conspicuously located adjacent to the opening.

              (c) All piping, valves, and fittings of ferrous materials shall be protected inside and outside against corrosion unless specifically approved otherwise by the Commandant.
              (d) A pressure relief valve or equivalent set to relieve between 2,400 and 2,800 pounds p.s.i. shall be installed in the distributing manifold or such other location as to protect the piping in the event that all branch line shut- off valves are closed.
              (e) All deadend lines shall extend at least 2 inches beyond the last orifice and shall be closed with cap or plug.
              (f) All piping, valves, and fittings shall be securely supported, and where necessary, protected against injury.
              (g) Drains and dirt traps shall be fitted where necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt or moisture. Drains and dirt traps shall be located in accessible locations where possible.
              (h) Piping shall be used for no other purpose except that it may be incorporated with the fire-detecting system.
              (i) Piping passing through living quarters shall not be fitted with drains or other openings within such spaces.
              (j) Installation test requirements are:

              (1) Upon completion of the piping installation, and before the cylinders are connected, a pressure test shall be applied as set forth in this paragraph. Only carbon dioxide or other inert gas shall be used for this test.
              (2) The piping from the cylinders to the stop valves in the manifold shall be subjected to a pressure of 1,000 pounds p.s.i. With no additional gas being introduced to the system, it shall be demonstrated that the leakage of the system is such as not to permit a pressure drop of more than 150 pounds per square inch per minute for 2-minute period.
              (3) The individual branch lines to the various spaces protected shall be subjected to a test similar to that described in the preceding paragraph with the exception that the pressure used shall be 600 pounds p.s.i. in lieu of 1,000 pounds p.s.i. For the purpose of this test, the distribution piping shall be capped within the space protected at the first joint ahead of the nozzles.
              (4) In lieu of the tests prescribed in the preceding paragraphs in this section, small independent systems protecting spaces such as emergency generator rooms, lamp lockers, etc., may be tested by blowing out the piping with the air at a pressure of at least 100 pounds p.s.i.

              (b) Systems of the type indicated in § 34.15-5(d), consisting of not more than 300 pounds of carbon dioxide, may have the cylinders located within the space protected. If the cylinder stowage is within the space protected, the system shall be arranged in an approved manner to be automatically operated by a heat actuator within the space in addition to the regular remote and local controls.
              (c) The space containing the cylinders shall be properly ventilated and designed to preclude an anticipated ambient temperature in excess of 130 degrees F.
              (d) Cylinders shall be securely fastened and supported, and where necessary, protected against injury.
              (e) Cylinders shall be so mounted as to be readily accessible and capable of easy removal for recharging and inspection. Provisions shall be available for weighing the cylinders.
              (f) Where subject to moisture, cylinders shall be so installed as to provide a space of at least 2 inches between the flooring and the bottom of the cylinders.
              (g) Cylinders shall be mounted in an upright position or inclined not more than 30 degrees from the vertical. However, cylinders which are fitted with flexible or bent siphon tubes may be inclined not more than 80 degrees from the vertical.
              (h) Where check valves are not fitted on each independent cylinder discharge, plugs or caps shall be provided for closing outlets when cylinders are removed for inspection or refilling.
              (i) All cylinders used for storing carbon dioxide must be fabricated, tested, and marked in accordance with §§ 147.60 and 147.65 of this chapter.

              § 34.15-50
              Lockout valves—T/ALL.
              (a) A lockout valve must be provided on any carbon dioxide extinguishing system protecting a space over 6,000 cubic feet in volume and installed or altered after July 9, 2013. “Altered” means modified or refurbished beyond the maintenance required by the manufacturer's design, installation, operation and maintenance manual.
              (b) The lockout valve must be a manually operated valve located in the discharge manifold prior to the stop valve or selector valves. When in the closed position, the lockout valve must provide complete isolation of the system from the protected space or spaces, making it impossible for carbon dioxide to discharge in the event of equipment failure during maintenance.
              (c) The lockout valve design or locking mechanism must make it obvious whether the valve is open or closed.
              (d) A valve is considered a lockout valve if it has a hasp or other means of attachment to which, or through which, a lock can be affixed, or it has a locking mechanism built into it.
              (e) The master or person-in-charge must ensure that the valve is locked open at all times, except while maintenance is being performed on the extinguishing system, when the valve must be locked in the closed position.
              (f) Lockout valves added to existing systems must be approved by the Commandant as part of the installed system.

              Inspection and testing required when making alterations, repairs, or other such operations involving riveting, welding, burning, or like fire-producing actions—TB/ALL.
              (a) The provisions of “Standard for the Control of Gas Hazards on Vessels to be Repaired,” NFPA No. 306, published by National Fire Protection Association, 1 Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02269, shall be used as a guide in conducting the inspections and issuance of certificates required by this section.
              (b) Until an inspection has been made to determine that such operation can be undertaken with safety, no alterations, repairs, or other such operations involving riveting, welding, burning, or like fire-producing actions shall be made:
              (1) Within or on the boundaries of cargo tanks which have been used to carry flammable or combustible liquid or chemicals in bulk, or within spaces adjacent to such cargo tanks; or,
              (2) Within or on the boundaries of fuel tanks; or,
              (3) To pipe lines, heating coils, pumps, fittings, or other appurtenances connected to such cargo or fuel tanks.
              (c) Such inspections shall be made and evidenced as follows:
              (1) In ports or places in the United States or its territories and possessions, the inspection shall be made by a marine chemist certificated by the National Fire Protection Association; however, if the services of such certified marine chemist are not reasonably available, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, upon the recommendation of the vessel owner and his contractor or their representative, shall select a person who, in the case of an individual vessel, shall be authorized to make such inspection. If the inspection indicates that such operations can be undertaken with safety, a certificate setting forth the fact in writing and qualified as may be required, shall be issued by the certified marine chemist or the authorized person before the work is started. Such qualifications shall include any requirements as may be deemed necessary to maintain, insofar as can reasonably be done, the safe conditions in the spaces certified, throughout the operation and shall include such additional tests and certifications as considered required. Such qualifications and requirements shall include precautions necessary to eliminate or minimize hazards that may be present from protective coatings or residues from cargoes.
              (2) When not in such a port or place, and a marine chemist or such person authorized by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, is not reasonably available, the inspection shall be made by the senior officer present and a proper entry shall be made in the vessel's logbook.
              (d) It shall be the responsibility of the senior officer present to secure copies of certificates issued by the certified marine chemist or such person authorized by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. It shall be the responsibility of the senior officer present, insofar as the persons under his control are concerned, to maintain a safe condition on the vessel by full observance of all qualifications and requirements listed by the marine chemist in the certificate.

              Open hopper type barges—B/ALL.
              (a) With the exception of those open hopper type barges constructed or modified in conformance with the requirements of subpart 32.63 of this subchapter, the special operating conditions in this section apply to all other open hopper type barges carrying those cargoes listed in table 30.25-1, of this chapter, which are defined as:
              (1) Flammable liquids having a Reid vapor pressure in excess of 25 pounds per square inch, absolute, in independent tanks (part 32 of this subchapter).
              (2) Liquefied flammable gases (part 38 of this subchapter).
              (b) All open hopper type barges, while carrying in bulk any of the cargoes described in paragraph (a) of this section, shall be operated in conformance with the provisions in this section. However, the provisions in this section are not applicable to such barges when empty (not necessarily cleaned or gas-freed).
              (c)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no such open hopper type barge shall be placed as a lead barge in any tow. Such barges shall be placed in protected positions within the tow so that the danger from diving or swamping will be minimized. Where, due to operating conditions, compliance with this paragraph is impossible, the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section apply. The person in charge of the towing vessels shall be responsible for compliance with this paragraph.
              (2) No such open hopper type barge shall be moved from a loading facility unless all void spaces and bilges are substantially free of water. Periodic inspections and necessary pumping shall be carried out to insure the maintenance of such water-free conditions, in order to minimize the free surface effect in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. Except when otherwise considered necessary for inspection or pumping, all hatch covers and other hull closure devices for void spaces and hull compartments shall be closed and secured at all times. In the case of unmanned barges, the person in charge of the towing vessel shall be deemed to be in charge of the barge, and all requirements to be carried out on the barge shall be carried out by or under the direction of such person.
              (3) When an open hopper type barge is in an exposed position, such that protection from swamping provided by adjoining barges cannot be obtained from location within the two alone, it shall be the responsibility of the person in charge of the towing vessel to control speed so as to insure protection against diving and swamping of the barge, having due regard to its design and freeboard, and to the operating conditions.

              (d) To show that special operating requirements apply to a specific open hopper type barge, additional placards or signs shall be displayed in at least four different locations on the barge when the cargoes described in paragraph (a) of this section are carried in any form in the cargo tanks. The placards or signs shall be posted on the barge approximately amidships on each side and near the centerline of each end, facing outboard. Racks, or other suitable means, for mounting such placards or signs shall be so arranged as to provide clear visibility and shall be protected from becoming readily damaged or obscured. The placards or signs shall be at least equal in dimensions to the DOT standard tank car “Dangerous” placard (103/4 inches square or larger), and shall display a circle (10 inches in diameter or larger) with alternating quadrants of white and red, and so mounted that the red quadrants are centered on the vertical axis. The shipper and/or owner of the barge shall be responsible for the installation of the required placards or signs, including maintenance of them while such barge is in temporary storage with cargo aboard. The person in charge of the towing vessel shall be responsible for the continued maintenance of the placards or signs while such barge is in transit.

              § 38.05-3
              Design and construction of pressure vessel type cargo tanks—TB/ALL.
              (a) Cargo tanks of pressure vessel configuration (e.g. cylindrical, spherical, etc.) shall be designed, fabricated, inspected, and tested in accordance with the applicable requirements of part 54 of subchapter F (Marine Engineering) of this chapter, except as otherwise provided for in this part.
              (b) The requirements of this section anticipate that cargo tanks constructed as pressure vessels will, by themselves, constitute the cargo containment system and usually will not require a secondary barrier.
              (c) In the design of the tank, consideration shall be given to the possibility of the tank being subjected to external loads. Consideration shall also be given to excessive loads that can be imposed on the tanks by their support due to static and dynamic forces under operating conditions or during testing. The design shall show the manner in which the tanks are to be installed, supported, and secured, and shall be approved prior to tank installation.
              (d) Tanks with a service temperature of minus 20 °F. or lower and fabricated of ferritic materials shall be stress relieved.
              (e) Unlagged cargo tanks, where the cargo is transported, at or near ambient temperatures, shall be designed for the vapor pressure of the gas at 115 °F. The design shall also be based on the minimum internal pressure (maximum vacuum), plus the maximum external static head to which the tank may be subjected. Whenever surrounding cargo is at a greater temperature than the maximum allowable temperature of the liquefied flammable gas tanks, the liquefied flammable gas cargo is to be such that the design pressure of the liquefied flammable gas tank is not exceeded.

              (f) Where cargo tanks, in which the cargo is transported at or near ambient temperature, are lagged with an insulation material of a thickness to provide a thermal conductance of not more than 0.075 B.t.u. per square foot per degree Fahrenheit differential in temperature per hour, the tanks shall be designed for a pressure of not less than the vapor pressure of the gas at 105 °F. The insulation material shall conform to the requirements of § 38.05-20. The design shall also be based on the minimum internal pressure (maximum vacuum) plus the maximum external static head to which the tank may be subjected.
              (g) Cargo tanks in which the temperature is maintained below the normal atmospheric temperature by refrigeration or other acceptable means shall be designed for a pressure of not less than 110 percent of the vapor pressure corresponding to the temperature of the liquid at which the system is maintained, or the pressure corresponding to the greatest dynamic and static loads expected to be encountered either in service or during testing. For mechanically stress relieved cargo tanks, additional factors relating design pressure and maximum allowable pressure shall be as specified by the Commandant.

              § 38.05-4
              Design and construction of nonpressure vessel type cargo tanks—TB/ALL.
              (a) The requirements in this section anticipate a cargo containment system consisting of a primary tank which is structurally self-supporting and, where required, a secondary barrier. Other vessel or cargo tank configurations, such as membrane type liners externally supported, will be considered upon submission of substantiating data, and based upon such additional tests as the Commandant may direct.
              (b) A secondary barrier is an arrangement or structure designed to contain the cargo temporarily if leakage develops in the primary container. A secondary barrier shall be provided where leakage from the primary container may cause lowering of the temperature of the ship's structure to an unsafe level. The secondary barrier shall be constructed of material suitable to contain the cargo at the service temperature.
              (c) The design of the cargo containment systems shall be such that under normal service conditions, or upon failure of the primary tank, the hull structure shall not be cooled down to a temperature which is unsafe for the materials involved. Structural members not suitable for the service temperatures of the cargo shall be protected by a secondary barrier consisting of suitable structural containment together with necessary associated insulation. Heat transmission studies and tests may be required to demonstrate that the arrangement is feasible and that the final material temperatures are acceptable.
              (d) The design and construction of the cargo tanks shall be at least equivalent to the standards established by the American Bureau of Shipping or other recognized classification society. For special tanks, or designs not contemplated by standards of the classification society, a detailed analysis of the entire tank, or designated parts thereof, shall be made and submitted to the Commandant for approval.
              (e) The cargo tank shall be designed for a head of cargo at least equal to the highest level the liquid cargo may attain plus the maximum venting pressure. In no case shall a head of cargo less than 4 feet above the cargo hatch or expansion trunk be used.
              (f) The design shall investigate the thermal stresses induced in the cargo tank during loading. Where necessary, devices for spray loading or other methods of precooling or cooling during loading shall be included in the design.

              (g) All weld intersections or crossings in joints of primary tank shells shall be radiographed for a distance of 10 thicknesses from the intersection. All other welding in the primary tank and in the secondary barrier shall be spot radiographed in accordance with the requirements of part 54 of subchapter F (Marine Engineering) of this chapter.

              Markings—TB/ALL.
              (a)(1) Upon satisfactory completion of tests and inspection, pressure vessel and nonpressure vessel type cargo tanks, shall have markings as required by § 54.10-20 of subchapter F (Marine Engineering) of this chapter except that for nonpressure vessel type tanks, the Coast Guard number and pressure vessel class shall be omitted.
              (2) Hydrostatic test for pressure vessel type tanks shall be that specified in § 38.25-1(b). In the case of nonpressure vessel type tanks, the hydrostatic test pressure shall mean the pressure specified in § 38.25-1(d), while the maximum allowable pressure shall mean the maximum venting pressure as used in § 38.05-4(e). Where it is not feasible to attach the nameplate to the tank, it shall be conspicuously displayed nearby.
              (b) All tank inlet and outlet connections, except safety relief valves, liquid level gaging devices, and pressure gages, shall be labeled to designate whether they terminate in the vapor or liquid space. Labels of corrosion-resistant material may be attached to valves.
              (c) All tank markings shall be permanently and legibly stamped in a readily visible position, and shall not be obscured by painting. If the tanks are lagged, the markings attached to the tank proper shall be duplicated on a corrosion-resistant plate secured to the outside jacket of the lagging.

              Installation of cargo tanks—general—TB/ALL.
              (a)(1) Cargo tanks shall be supported on foundations of steel or other suitable material and securely anchored in place to prevent the tanks from shifting when subjected to external forces. Each tank shall be so supported as to prevent the concentration of excessive loads on the supporting portions of the shell or head as prescribed under § 38.05-2(d).
              (2) Cargo tanks installed in barges shall comply with the requirements of § 32.63-25 of this subchapter.
              (b) Foundations, and stays where required, shall be designed for support and constraint of the weight of the full tank, and the dynamic loads imposed thereon. Thermal movement shall also be considered.
              (c) Foundations and stays which may be exposed to the cargo shall be suitable for the temperatures involved and be impervious to the cargo.
              (d) The design of the foundations and stays shall consider the resonance of the cargo tank, or parts thereof, and the vibratory forces, found in the tank vessel. If necessary, effective damping arrangements shall be provided.
              (e) Independent containment systems shall be so arranged as to provide a minimum clearance of not less than 24 inches from the vessel's side and not less than 15 inches from the vessel's bottom to provide access for inspection of the hull. Clearances for collision protection, where required by other parts of the regulations in this subchapter, may increase the clearances specified here.
              (1) For pressure vessel type tanks the distance between adjacent tanks and between tanks and vessel's structure shall be adequate to permit access for inspection and maintenance of all tank surfaces and hull structure as approved by the Commandant. Alternate provisions may be made for inspection and maintenance of the vessel's structure and tanks by moving such tanks or by providing equivalent acceptable means for remote inspection.

              (2) For nonpressure vessel type containment systems, access shall be arranged to permit inspection of one side each of the primary tank and secondary barrier, under normal shipyard conditions. Containment systems which, because of their peculiar design, cannot be visually inspected to this degree, may be specially considered provided an equivalent degree of safety is attained.
              
              (f) Cargo tanks may be installed on deck, under deck, or with the tanks protruding through the deck. All tanks shall be installed with the manhole openings located in the open above the weather deck.

              (g) For pressure vessel type cargo tanks, the following conditions apply:
              (1) Liquefied flammable gas cargo tanks may be located in cargo tanks or in spaces which meet the requirements for cofferdams as defined in § 30.10-13 of this subchapter. When liquefied flammable gas cargo tanks are installed in cargo tanks, such cargo tanks may be used simultaneously or separately for the carriage of flammable or combustible liquids up to and including the grade for which the cargo tanks are otherwise certified in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.
              (2) Where the liquefied flammable gas tanks are installed in cargo tanks and a portion of the liquefied flammable gas tanks extend above the weather deck, the penetration shall be made gastight and watertight, and shall be such as to provide full compliance with the structural requirements including testing for the hull and integral tanks. In the application of the requirements for the hydrostatic test of the cargo tanks, the hydrostatic test shall in no case be less severe than the worst anticipated service condition of the cargo loading. In the design and testing of independent cargo tanks and integral cargo tanks consideration shall be given to the possibility of the independent tanks being subjected to external loads.
              (3) Where the liquefied flammable gas tanks are installed in nontank hull spaces and a portion of the tank extends above the weather deck, provision shall be made to maintain the weathertightness of the deck, except that the weathertightness of the upper deck need not be maintained on:
              (i) Vessels operating on restricted routes which are sufficiently protected; or,
              (ii) Open hopper type barges of acceptable design.

              (ii) Self-extinguishing, as determined by ASTM D 4986, “Standard Test Method for Horizontal Burning Characteristics of Cellular Polymeric Materials,” (incorporated by reference, see § 38.01-3) and covered by a suitable steel cover.
              (2) Insulation in a location protected against possible ignition by enclosure in a tight steel envelope in which inert conditions are maintained need satisfy no requirement for combustibility except chemical stability.
              (3) Insulation in a location protected against possible high temperature or source of ignition by continuous surrounding structural voids or ballast tanks need satisfy no requirement for combustibility except chemical stability.
              (b) All insulation shall be of a vapor-proof construction, or have a vapor-proof coating of a fire-retardant material acceptable to the Commandant. Unless the vapor barrier is inherently weather resistant, tanks exposed to the weather shall be fitted with a removable sheet metal jacket of not less than 0.083-inch thick over the vapor-proof coating and flashed around all openings so as to be weathertight. Weather resistant coatings shall have sheet metal over areas subject to mechanical damage.
              (c) The insulation shall be adequately protected in areas of probable mechanical damage.

              (d) Insulation which forms an integral part of the secondary barrier shall meet the following additional requirements:
              
              (1) When the secondary barrier is called upon to contain the cargo, insulating material which is contacted shall not be affected by the cargo. Samples of the insulating material shall be tested in the cargo for solubility, absorption and shrinkage. The samples shall be checked for the above effects at intervals not exceeding 1 week, for a total test period of 6 weeks.
              (2) Any adhesives, sealers, coatings, or vapor barrier compounds used in conjunction with the insulating material shall be similarly tested to insure suitable cargo resistive properties.
              (3) The insulation shall have sufficient mechanical strength for the proposed design. Additionally, the thermal expansion of the insulation relative to the material to which it is affixed shall be considered in the design.
              (e) The insulation for the piping systems shall be at least of the “self-extinguishing” type described in paragraph (a) of this section, and comply with the requirements contained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

              § 38.20-1
              Venting—T/ALL.
              (a) Each safety relief valve installed on a cargo tank shall be connected to a branch vent of a venting system which shall be constructed so that the discharge of gas will be directed vertically upward to a point which shall extend to a height above the weather deck equal to at least one-third the beam of the vessel and to a minimum of at least 10 feet, and shall terminate at a comparable distance from any other living or working space, ventilator inlet, or source of vapor ignition. When special conditions will prevent the vent line header outlets being permanently installed at a height above the deck of one-third the beam of the vessel, then an adjustable system shall be provided which, when extended vertically, shall be capable of reaching a height of one-third the beam of the vessel.
              (b) The capacity of branch vents or vent headers shall depend upon the number of cargo tanks connected to such branch or header as provided for in the table 38.20-1(b), and upon the total safety relief valve discharge capacity.

              (c) In addition to the requirements specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the size of the branch vents or vent headers, shall be such that the back pressure in the relief valve discharge lines shall not be more than 10 percent of the safety relief valve setting. In nonpressure vessel vent systems, however, where the maximum back pressure of 10 percent of the relief valve setting is insufficient to move the gases through any but an extremely large diameter vent pipe, the back pressure may exceed 10 percent provided:
              (1) The pressure in the tank during venting does not exceed 120 percent of the tank maximum allowable pressure; and,

              (2) The safety relief valve is sized to discharge the required capacity with the tank pressure and vent back pressure actually used.
              
              (d) Return bends and restrictive pipe fittings are not permitted.
              (e) Vents and headers shall be so installed as to prevent excessive stresses on safety relief valve mountings.
              (f) The vent discharge riser shall be so located as to provide protection against mechanical injury and such discharge pipes shall be fitted with loose raincaps or other suitable means to prevent entrance of rain or snow.
              (g) No valve of any type shall be fitted in the vent pipe between the safety relief valve and the vent outlets.
              (h) Provisions shall be made to drain condensate from the vent header piping. Special precautions shall insure that condensate does not accumulate at or near the relief valves.
              (i) Relief valves discharging liquid cargo shall not be connected to the branch vent or vent header lines from the cargo tanks. They may, however, be connected to an accumulator, the vapor space of which, may in turn, be connected to the vent header system. Relief valves in the cargo piping system may discharge back to the cargo tanks.
              (j) Vapor discharged to the atmosphere in accordance with § 38.05-25(b) shall utilize valves separate from the safety relief valves.

              (a) Safety relief valves on cargo tanks in barges may be connected to individual or common risers which shall extend to a reasonable height above the deck. An alternate arrangement consisting of a branch vent header system as required by § 38.20-1 may be installed. In any case, the provisions of § 38.20-1 (d) through (j) shall apply.
              (b) Arrangements providing for venting cargo tanks at sea on unmanned barges will be considered by the Commandant upon presentation of plans.
            
            
              § 38.20-10
              Ventilation—T/ALL.
              (a) A power ventilation system shall be provided for compartments containing pumps, compressors, pipes, control spaces, etc. connected with the cargo handling facilities. These compartments shall be ventilated in such a way as to remove vapors from points near the floor level or bilges, or other areas where vapor concentrations may be expected. The compartments shall be equipped with power ventilation of the exhaust type having capacity sufficient to effect a complete change of air in not more than 3 minutes equal to the volume of the compartment and associated trunks.
              (b) The power ventilation units shall not produce a source of vapor ignition in either the compartment or the ventilation system associated with the compartment. Inlets to exhaust ducts shall be provided and located at points where concentrations of vapors may be expected. Ventilation from the weather deck shall be provided.

              Operational requirements for vapor control systems during cargo transfer—TB/ALL.

              (a) Vapor from a tank vessel may not be transferred to a facility in the United States, or vapor from a facility storage tank may not be transferred to a tank vessel, unless the facility's marine vapor control system (VCS) is certified by a certifying entity as meeting the requirements of 33 CFR part 154, subpart P and the facility's facility operations manual is marked by the local Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) as required by 33 CFR 154.325(d).
              (b) Vapor from a tank vessel may not be transferred to a vessel that does not have its certificate of inspection or certificate of compliance endorsed as meeting the requirements of this part and for controlling vapor of the cargo being transferred.
              (c) For each cargo transferred using a vapor collection system, the pressure drop through the vapor collection system from the most remote cargo tank to the vessel vapor connection, including vapor hoses if used by the vessel, must be—
              (1) Calculated at the maximum transfer rate and at lesser transfer rates;
              (2) Calculated using a density estimate for the cargo vapor and air mixture, or vapor and inert gas mixture, based on a partial pressure (partial molar volumes) method for the mixture, assuming ideal gas law conditions;
              (3) Calculated using a vapor growth rate as stated in 46 CFR 39.2011(d) for the cargo being transferred; and
              (4) Included in the vessel's transfer procedures as a table or graph, showing the liquid transfer rate versus the pressure drop.
              (d) The rate of cargo transfer must not exceed the maximum allowable transfer rate as determined by the lesser of the following:
              (1) Eighty percent of the total venting capacity of the pressure relief valves in the cargo tank venting system when relieving at the set pressure.
              (2) The total vacuum relieving capacity of the vacuum relief valves in the cargo tank venting system when relieving at the set pressure.
              (3) For a given pressure at the facility vapor connection, or if vessel-to-vessel transfer at the vapor connection of the service vessel, then the rate based on pressure drop calculations at which the pressure in any cargo tank connected to the vapor collection system exceeds 80 percent of the setting of any pressure relief valve in the cargo tank venting system.
              (e) Cargo tanks must not be filled higher than—
              (1) 98.5 percent of the cargo tank volume; or
              (2) The level at which an overfill alarm complying with 46 CFR 39.2007 or 39.2009(a)(2) is set.
              (f) A cargo tank should remain sealed from the atmosphere during cargo transfer operations. The cargo tank may only be opened temporarily for gauging or sampling while the tank vessel is connected to a VCS as long as the following conditions are met:
              (1) The cargo tank is not being filled or no vapor is being transferred into the cargo tank;
              (2) For cargo loading, any pressure in the cargo tank vapor space is first reduced to atmospheric pressure by the VCS, except when the tank is inerted;
              (3) The cargo is not required to be closed or restricted gauged by 46 CFR part 151, Table 151.05 or part 153, Table 1; and
              (4) For static accumulating cargo, all metallic equipment used in sampling or gauging must be electrically bonded to the vessel and remain bonded to the vessel until it is removed from the tank, and if the tank is not inerted, 30 minutes must have elapsed after any cargo transfer to the tank is stopped, before the equipment is put into the tank.
              (g) For static accumulating cargo, the initial transfer rate must be controlled in accordance with OCIMF ISGOTT Section 11.1.7 (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 39.1005), in order to minimize the development of a static electrical charge.
              (h) If cargo vapor is collected by a facility that requires the vapor from the vessel to be inerted in accordance with 33 CFR 154.2105, the oxygen content in the vapor space of each cargo tank connected to the vapor collection system must not exceed 60 percent by volume of the cargo's minimum oxygen concentration for combustion (MOCC), or 8 percent by volume for vapor of crude oil, gasoline blends, or benzene, at the start of cargo transfer. The oxygen content of each tank, or each area of a tank formed by each partial bulkhead, must be measured at a point 1.0 meter (3.28 feet) below the tank top and at a point equal to one-half of the ullage.

              (i) If the vessel is equipped with an inert gas system, the isolation valve required by 46 CFR 39.2001(e) must remain closed during vapor transfer.
              (j) Unless equipped with an automatic self-test and circuit-monitoring feature, each high-level alarm and tank overfill alarm on a cargo tank being loaded, required by 46 CFR 39.2007 or 39.2009, must be tested at the tank for proper operation within 24 hours prior to the start of cargo transfer.

              (i) The maximum allowable gas-freeing rate is a function of the area open to the atmosphere for the cargo tank being gas-freed. The area open to the atmosphere must be large enough to maintain the pressure in the cargo tank being gas-freed at or above 14.5 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) (−0.2 pounds per square inch gauge (psig));
              (ii) The maximum allowable gas-freeing rate must be calculated from Table 1 of this section, using the area open to the atmosphere for the cargo tank being gas-freed as the entering determination;
              (2) For a fluid displacement system, the maximum allowable gas-freeing rate is determined by the lesser of the following:
              (i) Eighty percent of the total venting capacity of the pressure relief valve in the cargo tank venting system when relieving at its set pressure;
              (ii) Eighty percent of the total vacuum relieving capacity of the vacuum relief valve in the cargo tank venting system when relieving at its set pressure; or
              (iii) The rate based on pressure drop calculations at which, for a given pressure at the facility vapor connection, the pressure in the cargo tank being gas-freed exceeds 80 percent of the setting of any pressure relief valve in the cargo tank venting system.
              (d) Any hatch and/or fitting used to calculate the minimum area required to be open to the atmosphere must be opened and secured in such a manner as to prevent accidental closure during gas freeing. All flame screens for the hatch and/or fitting opened must be removed in order to allow for maximum airflow. The hatch and/or fitting must be secured open before the pressure in the cargo tank falls below 10 percent of the highest setting of any of the barge's vacuum relief valves.
              (e) “Do Not Close Hatch/Fitting” signs must be conspicuously posted near the hatch and/or fitting opened during gas-freeing operations.
              (f) To minimize the dangers of static electricity, all equipment used on the barge during gas-freeing and cleaning operations must be electrically bonded to the barge and tested to ensure electrical continuity before each use.
              (g) If the barge is equipped with an inert gas system, the inert gas main isolation valve must remain closed during cleaning operations.

              (h) Vapors from incompatible cargoes that are collected simultaneously must be kept separated throughout the barge's entire vapor collection system. Chemical compatibility must be determined in accordance with the procedures contained in 46 CFR part 150, part A.
