      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2018), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              § 42.03-30
              Exemptions for vessels.

              (a) For an individual vessel or category of vessels, upon the specific recommendation of the assigning authority, the Commandant may authorize an exemption from one or more load line requirements. Such recommendation and authorization will depend upon provision of any additional features as deemed necessary by the authorities to ensure the vessel's safety in the services and under the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (b) Exemptions from specific load line requirements for vessels meeting requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are authorized, subject to certain conditions, including type of voyage engaged in, as follows:
              (1) For vessels engaged on international voyages between the United States and near neighboring ports of its possessions or of foreign countries. The exemptions may be permitted because the requirements are deemed to be unreasonable or impracticable due to the sheltered nature of the waters on which the voyages occur or other conditions. These exemptions shall be valid only so long as such a vessel shall remain engaged on specific designated voyages. If the voyage involves a foreign country or countries, the United States will require an exemption agreement with such country or countries prior to the issuance of the appropriate load line certificate.
              (2) For vessels engaged on international voyages which embody features of a novel kind, and where nonexemption may seriously impede research, development, and incorporation of novel features into vessels. If the voyage or voyages intended involve a foreign country or countries, then the United States will require an exemption agreement with such country or countries prior to the issuance of a Load Line Exemption Certificate. If the Commandant grants an exemption pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2) to a U.S. flag vessel that operates on the Great Lakes of North America, he may notify the Chairman of the Board of Steamship Inspection of Canada of the nature of the exemption, but no special exemption certificate is issued.
              (3) For a vessel not normally engaged on international voyages but which is required to undertake a single international voyage under exceptional circumstances.
              (4) For self-propelled hopper dredges engaged on international voyages or on limited service domestic voyages by sea. These vessels may be exempt from applicable hatch cover requirements of § 42.15-25 of this part by showing they meet the requirements in § 174.310 of this chapter. When a Load Line Exemption Certificate is issued for this exemption, it must have an endorsement that only seawater is allowed in the vessel's hoppers.
              (c) A vessel given one or more exemptions from load line requirements under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be issued the appropriate load line certificate, using Form A1, A2, or A3. In each case the exemptions shall be specified on the load line certificate together with the Convention authority which authorizes such exemptions.
              (d) A vessel given one or more exemptions under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section will be issued a Load Line Exemption Certificate, using Form E1. This certificate shall be in lieu of a regular load line certificate, and the vessel shall be considered as in compliance with applicable load line requirements.
              (e) The Commandant may exempt from any of the requirements of this part a vessel that engages on a domestic voyage by sea or a voyage solely on the Great Lakes and embodies features of a novel kind, if the novel features and any additional safety measures required are described on the face of the issued certificate.
              (f) A vessel that is not usually engaged on domestic voyages by sea or on voyages on the Great Lakes but that, in exceptional circumstances, is required to undertake a single such voyage between two specific ports is—
              (1) Subject to 46 U.S.C. 5101-5116 and the applicable regulations of this subchapter; and
              (2) Issued a single voyage load line authorization by the Commandant that states the conditions under which the voyage may be made and any additional safety measures required for a single voyage.

              U.S.-flag vessels and Canadian vessels navigating on sheltered waters of Puget Sound and contiguous west coast waters of United States and Canada.
              (a) In a Treaty between the United States and Canada proclaimed on August 11, 1934, the respective Governments were satisfied of the sheltered nature of certain waters of the west coast of North America. It was agreed to exempt vessels of the United States and Canadian vessels from load line requirements when such vessels engage on international voyages originating on, wholly confined to, and terminating on such waters. In Article I of this Treaty these waters are described as follows: “* * * the waters of Puget Sound, the waters lying between Vancouver Island and the mainland, and east of a line from a point 1 nautical mile west of the city limits of Port Angeles in the State of Washington to Race Rocks on Vancouver Island, and of a line from Hope Island, British Columbia, to Cape Calvert, Calvert Island, British Columbia, the waters east of a line from Cape Calvert to Duke Point on Duke Island, and the waters north of Duke Island and east of Prince of Wales Island, Baranof Island, and Chicagof Island, the waters of Peril, Neva, and Olga Straits to Sitka, and the waters east of a line from Port Althorp of Chicagof Island to Cape Spencer, Alaska, are sheltered waters * * *.”
              (b) U.S.-flag vessels and Canadian vessels navigating on the treaty waters on a voyage as described in paragraph (a) of this section are by virtue of this Treaty of August 11, 1934, not subject to load line requirements in 46 U.S.C. 5101-5116, the 1966 Convention, and the regulations in this subchapter. Vessels navigating these sheltered waters and passing outside their boundary on any voyage cannot claim the benefits of this Treaty and shall be in compliance with the applicable load line requirements in 46 U.S.C. 5101-5116, the 1966 Convention, and the regulations in this subchapter.
              (c) Since subdivision requirements apply to all passenger vessels subject to the 1960 International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea, those passenger vessels navigating on the waters described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be in compliance with such 1960 Convention requirements and the regulations in part 46 of this subchapter. The Coast Guard issues to such a vessel a stability letter. The assigning authority is authorized to issue to such a passenger vessel an appropriate load line certificate, modified to meet the conditions governing her service assignment, and marking.

Except for vessels operating solely on the waters indicated in Article 5(2) of the 1966 Convention, an international voyage means a sea voyage from any country to a port outside such country, or conversely. For this purpose, every territory for the international relations of which any specific Contracting Government is responsible or for which the United Nations are the administering authority is regarded as a separate country.

              Cancellation of load line certificates or exemption certificates.
              (a) Since vessels described in § 42.03-5 or § 42.03-10 when found qualified are issued appropriate load line certificates or load line exemption certificates, under U.S. responsibility as indicated in § 42.07-45 such certificates may be canceled by proper U.S. authority for due cause, including one or more of the causes listed in paragraph (b) of this section. Such action may occur prior to the expiration date on the certificate and normal certificate surrender. The cancellation of such certificate means that the correctness of load line marks and compliance with conditions of assignment for the named vessel no longer are recognized by the United States and that the existing assigned load line marks are voided.
              (b) Certain causes for automatic cancellation of certificates are:
              (1) The conditions of assignment have not been maintained as required by this subchapter.
              (2) Material alterations have taken place in the hull or superstructure of the vessel, which will necessitate the assignment of an increased freeboard.
              (3) The fittings and appliances have not been maintained in an effective condition for the protection of openings, guardrails, freeing ports, and means of access to crew's quarters.
              (4) The structural strength of the vessel is lowered to such an extent that the vessel is unsafe.
              (5) The load line certificate or International Load Line Exemption Certificate is not endorsed to show the vessel has been surveyed annually or periodically by the issuing authority as required by this part or the 1966 Convention.
              (6) Issuance of a new load line certificate for the same vessel.
              (7) Surrender of a certificate for cancellation when required.
              (8) The owner, master, or agent of the vessel has furnished false or fraudulent information in or with the application for a certificate.

The Coast Guard District Commander may detain a vessel if it is so loaded as to be manifestly unsafe to proceed to sea.
              (b) If the Director, Field Operations (DFO) orders a vessel detained, he shall immediately inform the Coast Guard District Commander thereof, who shall thereupon advise the Director, Field Operations (DFO) whether or not he deems that the vessel may proceed to sea with safety. If the Coast Guard District Commander orders a vessel detained, such officer will furnish the Director, Field Operations (DFO) immediate notification of such detention. The clearance shall be refused to any vessel which shall have been ordered detained, which shall be in effect until it is shown that the vessel is not in violation of the applicable law and the regulations in this subchapter.

              (1) Where a vessel is detained for noncompliance with “material alteration” and “effective maintenance” requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the detention shall only be exercised insofar as may be necessary to ensure that the vessel can proceed to sea without danger to passengers or crew.
              (c) The detention of a vessel will be by written order of either the Coast Guard District Commander or the Director, Field Operations (DFO), depending on who orders the detention. The Coast Guard District Commander will immediately arrange for a survey in the manner prescribed by 46 U.S.C. 5113. Unless the owner or agent waives in writing and stipulates to accept the Coast Guard's survey, the Coast Guard District Commander shall appoint three disinterested surveyors and, where practicable, one of them shall be from the Surveying Staff of the American Bureau of Shipping. Such surveyors shall conduct a survey to ascertain whether or not the vessel is loaded in violation of the applicable provisions in the load line acts, and the regulations in this subchapter. If the survey confirms the allegation that the vessel is in violation of either law or the applicable regulations in this subchapter, “the owner and agent shall bear the costs of the survey in addition to any penalty or fine imposed”, as provided in these laws.
              (d) Whenever a vessel is detained, the master or owner may, within 5 days, appeal to the Commandant who may, if he desires, order a further survey, and may affirm, set aside, or modify the order of the detaining officer.
              (e) Where a foreign vessel is detained or intervention action of any other kind is taken against a foreign vessel, the officer carrying out the action shall immediately inform in writing the Consul or the diplomatic representative of the State whose flag the vessel is flying, of the decision involved together with all pertinent circumstances under which intervention was deemed necessary.
              (f) Under 46 U.S.C. 5109 a vessel of a foreign country which has ratified the 1966 Convention, or which holds a recognized and valid 1930 Convention certificate, or which holds a valid Great Lakes Certificate, shall be exempt from the provisions of the regulations in this subchapter insofar as the marking of the load lines and the certificating thereof are concerned, so long as such country similarly recognizes the load lines established by this subchapter for the purpose of a voyage by sea subject to the proviso in paragraph (f)(1) of this section or the alternative proviso in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
              (1) If the foreign vessel is marked with load lines and has on board a valid International or Great Lakes Load Line Certificate certifying to the correctness of the marks, the control provisions in this part which are in accord with Article 21 of the 1966 Convention shall be observed. In this connection, the vessel shall not be loaded beyond the limits allowed by the certificate. The position of the load lines on the vessel shall correspond with the certificate. The vessel shall not have been so materially altered as to make the vessel manifestly unfit to proceed to sea without danger to human life, in regard to:
              (i) The hull or superstructure (if necessitating assignment of an increased freeboard); and/or,
              (ii) The appliances and fittings for protection of openings, guardrails, freeing ports, and means of access to crew's quarters (if necessitating replacement or other effective maintenance).
              (2) (Alternatively provided) If the foreign vessel has on board an International Load Line Exemption Certificate in lieu of an International Load Line Certificate, 1966, in such case, verify that it is valid and any conditions stipulated therein are met.

              (g) A foreign vessel of a nation for which the 1966 Convention has not come into force does not qualify for an International Load Line Certificate, 1966. In lieu thereof, such a vessel shall be required to have on board a valid Form B load line certificate or a recognized 1930 Convention certificate.

              § 42.09-1
              Assignment of load lines.
              (a) The assignment of load lines is conditioned upon the structural efficiency and satisfactory stability of the vessel, and upon the provisions provided on the vessel for her effective protection and that of the crew. Certain vessels, such as vessels carrying all their cargo as deck cargo, or vessels where design or service require special conditions to be applicable, shall have certain stability limitations imposed on them, as may be necessary. When stability limitations for a vessel are prescribed, the assigning authority shall furnish the master the vessel's maximum draft permitted and other conditions, including reference to Commandant approved operating stability features, which may be applicable.
              (1) No load line assignment shall be made under this part to a vessel proceeding on a foreign voyage, or where the load line assignment is related to the flooded stability provisions and the vessel is proceeding on a domestic voyage, until the applicable light ship characteristics are established and incorporated into the vessel's stability data approved by the Commandant and furnished to the master of the vessel.
              (2) If load line assignments are made to vessels for coastwise voyages before the results of the required stability characteristics are determined and incorporated into the vessel's stability data approved by the Commandant, then such load line assignments shall be regarded as conditional and shall be subject to verification or modification for removal of the conditional status. Any vessel with a conditional load line assignment shall not be loaded beyond a conservative safe draft. Where the Commandant deems it unnecessary, the requirement for furnishing stability information to the masters of coastwise vessels assigned load lines not related to flooded stability may be omitted and the assigning authority and others concerned will be so notified.
              (b) Each vessel subject to load line requirements shall carry on board a valid certificate attesting to compliance with such requirements. (See §§ 42.07-35 and 42.07-40 for additional data furnished to the vessel.)
              (c) The master of the vessel for which a load line certificate has been issued shall be responsible for the maintenance of such certificate on board such vessel and for compliance with its terms and conditions. Additionally, the master shall be responsible for having the current load line survey report on board the vessel. This report shall be made available to surveyors when carrying out subsequent load line surveys.

              § 42.09-5
              All vessels—division into types.
              (a) For the purposes of this part, each vessel to which this part applies is either a Type “A” or a Type “B” vessel.
              (b) A Type “A” vessel is a vessel that—
              (1) Is designed to carry only liquid cargoes in bulk;
              (2) Has a high degree of watertight and structural integrity of the deck exposed to the weather, with only small openings to cargo compartments that are closed by watertight gasketed covers of steel or other material considered equivalent by the Commandant; and
              (3) Has a low permeability of loaded cargo compartments.
              (c) A Type “B” vessel is any vessel that is not a Type “A” vessel.
              (d) Requirements governing the assignment of freeboards for Types “A” and “B” vessels are in subparts 42.20 and 42.25 of this part.

              Stability, subdivision, and strength.
              (a) All vessels. Where regulations in this part, or in part 46 of this subchapter, require or permit load line assignment on the basis of the vessel's ability to meet specified flooding, including damage stability requirements, the owner shall furnish the necessary plans and calculations demonstrating that the vessel is in compliance with the applicable requirements. This material shall be furnished to the assigning authority for approval review at the earliest practicable date except where specifically required by part 46 of this subchapter for passenger vessels to be submitted to the Commandant for approval.
              (1) When stability information is required, the plans shall include the location and extent of all watertight subdivision bulkheads, etc., involved.
              (2) Additional stability, subdivision, and strength requirements are in §§ 42.09-1, 42.13-1, 42.13-5, and 42.15-1. The applicable flooded stability requirements are in §§ 42.20-3 through 42.20-13.
              (b) Passenger vessels. In passenger vessels where the positions of the maximum load lines is subject to determination by the application of subdivision and stability requirements in this subchapter, the provisions of both parts 42 and 46 shall be accounted for and developed as necessary. See subchapter H (Passenger Vessels) of this chapter for related data required to be submitted to the Commandant.
              (c) Light ship data. All plans, etc., necessary for obtaining the Commandant's approval of test results (light ship data) and stability information shall be furnished by the owner. In the absence of existing acceptable light ship stability information, such data shall be obtained from a stability test performed under the supervision of the Commandant. Results of such tests, if satisfactory, will be approved by the Commandant.

              § 42.09-15
              Surveys by the American Bureau of Shipping or assigning authority.
              (a) General. Before issuing a certificate or placement of load line marks on a vessel, the assigning and issuing authority shall make an initial or periodic survey of the vessel as required by this subchapter. A load line survey report shall be made, reflecting information and facts based on initial surveys, including required and special elements as may be deemed necessary by the assigning authority or the Commandant.
              (b) Initial survey. An initial survey shall be made before the vessel is put in service or the first time the assigning authority is requested to survey a vessel. The survey shall include a complete examination of its structure and equipment insofar as required by the applicable requirements in this subchapter. This survey shall be such as to ensure that the arrangements, materials, scantlings, and subsequent placement of load line marks fully comply with applicable requirements.
              (c) Periodical survey. A periodical survey shall be made at intervals not exceeding five (5) years from an initial or previous periodic survey. The survey shall be similar to the initial survey insofar as extent and purpose are concerned.
              (1) If the load line marks are found to be correct for the condition the vessel is then in, the assigning and issuing authority shall issue a new load line certificate, valid for such time as the condition of the vessel then warrants but in no case for a period of longer than 5 years. If, after a survey has been passed, a loadline certificate can not be issued before the current certificate expires, the current certificate may be extended by an endorsement in accordance with the requirements contained in § 42.07-45(d). This endorsement of the assigning authority shall be placed on the back of the certificate, as shown on the forms in subpart 42.50. However, if there have been alterations which affect the vessel's freeboards, such extension shall not be granted. This prohibition is the same as in Article 19(2) of the 1966 Convention.
              (2) The periodical survey, including certificate extension or reissue, for a vessel holding an international load line exemption certificate for more than one voyage, shall be the same as for any other vessel covered by this section except for load line marks. However, other conditions specified in the exemption certificate shall be verified.
              (d) Annual surveys for endorsements. Vessels subject to initial and periodic surveys shall have annual surveys, within 3 months either way of the certificate's anniversary date. The annual surveys shall be made by and prove satisfactory to the assigning and issuing authority prior to executing the required annual endorsements on load line certificates or exemption certificates. The scope shall be as defined in § 42.09-40 and such as to ensure that the applicable load line marks are found to be correct for the condition the vessel is then in.

              § 42.09-20
              Surveys of foreign vessels.
              (a) General. Foreign vessels of countries which have not ratified or acceded to the 1966 Convention, or which do not have valid certificates issued under other international convention or treaty and recognized by the United States of America, if desiring to depart from a port or place in the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Territory of Guam, or other U.S. possessions, shall be subjected to survey, marking, and certification by a load line assigning and issuing authority as authorized under § 42.07-35 or § 42.07-40, unless:
              (1) The vessel is exempted by the provision of 46 U.S.C. 5102; or
              (2) The vessel is under tow and carrying neither passengers nor cargo.
              (b) Scope of survey. A periodical survey described in § 42.09-15(c) shall be conducted by and prove satisfactory to the assigning and issuing authority. It shall be made prior to issue or reissue of the applicable certificate.
              (c) Certification of load lines. The assigning and issuing authority after determining the vessel meets the applicable requirements in this part may issue a load line certificate subject to requirements in § 42.07-45 and on the applicable form described in subpart 42.50 of this part: Provided, That the load line certificate issued shall be valid for a period of 1 year. The certificate may be revalidated by endorsement for additional 1 year periods if the condition of the vessel so warrants, but in any event the certificate shall become void five (5) years from date of issue, or at the expiration of the fourth (4th) yearly validation, whichever occurs first. Whenever the condition of the vessel warrants special limitations, such information and facts shall be attested to on the front or back of the certificate as necessary, by the assigning and issuing authority.

              Applications for load line assignments and certificates for vessels other than U.S.-flag vessels.

              (a) The application for the assignment of load lines and certificate for a foreign vessel belonging to (or which will belong to) either a country ratifying or acceding to the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, or to a country with which the United States of America has a reciprocal load line agreement in effect shall be made by the Government whose flag the vessel flies, or will fly. The application may be made direct to the American Bureau of Shipping, or after receiving the Commandant's approval, to a recognized classification society which that country has requested as an assigning and issuing authority. When the load line assignment and certificate are authorized pursuant to the requirements in this part, the certificate must contain a statement that it has been issued at the request of a specific Government, which shall be named therein.
              (1) When the load line assignment is performed under the applicable regulations in this subchapter, the assigning and issuing authority shall transmit to the requesting Government at the earliest practicable date, one copy of each certificate issued, the load line survey report used for computing the freeboard, and the freeboard computations. For information, the assigning and issuing authority shall also notify the Commandant of the names of the vessel and the Government involved and the date and place where the work was done.
              (b) For a foreign vessel of a country not included in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner, master, or agent normally shall apply in writing to the American Bureau of Shipping, or to any other recognized assigning and issuing authority after it has been approved by the Commandant, for the assignment, survey, and certification of load lines, or for reissue of a load line certificate, as may be necessary for the vessel to clear ports of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Territory of Guam, or other U.S. possessions. Normally the same requirements, conditions, procedures, distribution of applicable certificates, etc., shall be applied to such foreign vessels which are applied to similar U.S.-flag vessels of 150 gross tons or over.

              Freeboards assigned vessels.
              (a) Vessels with mechanical means of propulsion, or lighters, barges, or other vessels without independent means of propulsion, shall be assigned freeboards in accordance with the provisions of §§ 42.13-1 to 42.20-75, inclusive.
              (b) Vessels carrying timber deck cargoes may be assigned, in addition to the freeboards required by paragraph (a) of this section, timber freeboards in accordance with the provisions of §§ 42.25-1 to 42.25-20, inclusive.
              (c) Vessels designed to carry sail, whether as the sole means of propulsion or as a supplementary means, and tugs, shall be assigned freeboards in accordance with the provisions of §§ 42.13-1 to 42.20-75, inclusive, and such additional freeboards as determined necessary by the Commandant under the procedure of paragraph (f) of this section.
              (d) Vessels of wood or of composite construction, or of other materials the use of which the Commandant has approved, or vessels whose constructional features are such as to render the application of the provisions of §§ 42.13-1 to 42.25-20 unreasonable or impracticable, shall be assigned freeboards as determined necessary by the Commandant under the procedure of paragraph (f) of this section.
              (e) The requirements in §§ 42.15-1 to 42.15-80, inclusive, shall apply to every vessel to which a minimum freeboard is assigned. Relaxations from these requirements may be granted to a vessel to which a greater than minimum freeboard is assigned provided the safety conditions of the vessel are determined to be satisfactory under paragraph (f) of this section.
              (f) In each case specified by paragraphs (c) to (e) inclusive of this section, the assigning authority shall report to the Commandant the specific matters in which the vessel is deficient or requires special freeboard consideration due to design, arrangement, construction materials, propulsive method, or relaxation of requirements in this part. The report shall also furnish background data and recommendations of the assigning authority (including freeboard additions), as will enable the Commandant to reach a decision.

              § 42.13-15
              Definitions of terms.
              (a) Length. The length (L) shall be taken as 96 percent of the total length on a waterline at 85 percent of the least molded depth measured from the top of the keel, or as the length from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, if that be greater. In vessels designed with a rake of keel the waterline on which this length is measured shall be parallel to the designed waterline.
              (b) Perpendiculars. The forward and after perpendiculars shall be taken at the forward and after ends of the length (L). The forward perpendicular shall coincide with the foreside of the stem on the waterline on which the length is measured.
              (c) Amidships. Amidships is at the middle of the length (L).
              (d) Breadth. Unless expressly provided otherwise, the breadth (B) is the maximum breadth of the vessel, measured amidships to the molded line of the frame in a vessel with a metal shell and to the outer surface of the hull in a vessel with a shell of any other material.
              (e) Molded depth. (1) The molded depth is the vertical distance measured from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side. In wood and composite vessels the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet. Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the distance is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.
              (2) In vessels having rounded gunwales, the molded depth shall be measured to the point of intersection of the molded lines of the deck and sides, the lines extending as though the gunwale were of angular design.
              (3) Where the freeboard deck is stepped and the raised part of the deck extends over the point at which the molded depth is to be determined, the molded depth shall be measured to a line of reference extending from the lower part of the deck along a line parallel with the raised part.
              (f) Depth for freeboard (D). (1) The depth for freeboard (D) is the molded depth amidships, plus the thickness of the freeboard deck stringer plate, where fitted, plus
              
              T(L−S)/L
              if the exposed freeboard deck is sheathed;
              
              
                where:
                
                
                  T is the mean thickness of the exposed sheathing clear of deck openings; and
                
                  S is the total length of superstructures as defined in paragraph (j)(4) of this section.
              
              
              (2) The depth for freeboard (D) in a vessel having a rounded gunwale with a radius greater than 4 percent of the breadth (B) or having topsides of unusual form is the depth for freeboard of a vessel having a midship section with vertical topsides and with the same round of beam and area of topside section equal to that provided by the actual midship section.
              (g) Block coefficient. The block coefficient (C
                b) is given by
              
              
                C
                b=Δ/L.B.d
                1
              
              
              

                where Δ is the volume of the molded displacement of the vessel, excluding bossing, in a vessel with a metal shell, and is the volume of displacement to the outer surface of the hull in a vessel with a shell of any other material, both taken at a molded draft of d
                  1; and, d
                  1 is 85 percent of the least molded depth.
              
              
              (h) Freeboard. The freeboard assigned is the distance measured vertically downward amidships from the upper edge of the deck line to the upper edge of the related load line.
              (i) Freeboard deck. (1) The freeboard deck is normally the uppermost complete deck exposed to weather and sea, which has permanent means of closing all openings in the weather part thereof, and below which all openings in the sides of the vessel are fitted with permanent means of watertight closing. In a vessel having a discontinuance freeboard deck, the lowest line of the exposed deck and the continuation of that line parallel to the upper part of the deck is taken as the freeboard deck. At the option of the owner and subject to the approval of the assigning authority a lower deck may be designated as the freeboard deck, provided it is a complete and permanent deck continuous in a fore and aft direction at least between the machinery space and peak bulkheads and continuous athwartships. When this lower deck is stepped the lowest line of the deck and the continuation of that line parallel to the upper part of the deck is taken as the freeboard deck.
              (2) When a lower deck is designated as the freeboard deck, that part of the hull which extends above the freeboard deck is treated as a superstructure so far as concerns the application of the conditions of assignment and the calculation of freeboard. It is from this deck that the freeboard is calculated.
              (j) Superstructure. (1) A superstructure is a decked structure on the freeboard deck, extending from side to side of the vessel or with the side plating not being inboard of the shell plating more than 4 percent to the breadth. (B). A raised quarter deck is regarded as a superstructure.
              (2) An enclosed superstructure is a superstructure with:
              (i) Enclosing bulkheads of efficient construction;
              (ii) Access openings, if any in these bulkheads fitted with doors complying with the requirements of § 42.15-10; and,

              (iii) All other openings in sides or ends of the superstructure fitted with efficient weathertight means of closing.
              
              
                Note:
                A bridge or poop shall not be regarded as enclosed unless access is provided for the crew to reach machinery and other working spaces inside the superstructures by alternative means, which are available at all times when bulkhead openings are closed.
              
              
              
              (3) The height of a superstructure is the least vertical height measured at side from the top of the superstructure deck beams to the top of the freeboard deck beams.
              (4) The length of a superstructure (S) is the mean length of the part of the superstructure which lies within the length (L).
              (k) Flush deck vessel. A flush deck vessel is one which has no superstructure on the freeboard deck.
              (l) Weathertight. Weathertight means that in any sea conditions water will not penetrate into the vessel.

              (a) The deck line is a horizontal line 12 inches in length and 1 inch in breadth. It shall be marked amidships on each side of the vessel, and its upper edge shall normally pass through the point where the continuation outwards of the upper surface of the freeboard deck intersects the outer surface of the shell (as illustrated in Figure 42.13-20(a)), provided that the deck line may be placed with reference to another fixed point on the vessel on condition that the freeboard is correspondingly corrected. The location of the reference point and the identification of the freeboard deck shall in all cases be indicated on the International Load Line Certificate (1966), and, as applicable, on all other load line certificates issued pursuant to this part 42.

              (e) The lower edges of the freeing ports shall be as near the deck as practicable. Two-thirds of the freeing port area required shall be provided in the half of the well nearest the lowest point of the sheer curve.
              (f) All such openings in the bulwarks shall be protected by rails or bars spaced approximately 9 inches apart. If shutters are fitted to freeing ports, ample clearance shall be provided to prevent jamming. Hinges shall have pins or bearings of noncorrodible material. If shutters are fitted with securing appliances, these appliances shall be of approved construction.

              § 42.15-75
              Protection of the crew.
              (a) The strength of the deckhouses used for the accommodation of the crew shall be to the satisfaction of the assigning authority.
              (b) Efficient guard rails or bulwarks must be fitted on all exposed parts of the freeboard and superstructure decks as follows:
              (1) The height of the bulwarks or guard rails must be at least 391/2 inches from the deck, provided that where this height would interfere with the normal operation of the vessel, a lesser height may be approved if the Commandant and the assigning authority are satisfied that adequate protection is provided.

              (2) On each vessel that is initially surveyed for load line assignment after January 1, 1976, and that is exclusively engaged in towing operations, the minimum bulwark or rail height on the freeboard deck may be reduced to 30 inches provided the assigning authority is satisfied that adequate grabrails are provided around the periphery of the deckhouse.
              (3) Portable rails may be used when operating conditions warrant their use.
              (c) The opening below the lowest course of the guard rails shall not exceed 9 inches. The other courses shall be not more than 15 inches apart. In the case of vessels with rounded gunwales the guard rail supports shall be placed on the flat of the deck.
              (d) Satisfactory means (in the form of guard rails, life lines, gangways or underdeck passages, etc.) shall be provided for the protection of the crew in getting to and from their quarters, the machinery space and all other parts used in the necessary work of the vessel.
              (e) Deck cargo carried on any vessel shall be so stowed that any opening which is in way of the cargo and which gives access to and from the crew's quarters, the machinery space and all other parts used in the necessary work of the vessel, can be properly closed and secured against the admission of water. Effective protection for the crew in the form of guard rails or life lines shall be provided above the deck cargo if there is no convenient passage on or below the deck of the vessel.

              § 42.15-80
              Special conditions of assignment for Type “A” vessels.
              (a) Machinery casings. Machinery casings on Type “A” vessels as defined in § 42.09-5(b) must be protected by an enclosed poop or bridge of at least standard height, or by a deckhouse of equal height and equivalent strength, except that machinery casings may be exposed if there are no openings giving direct access from the freeboard deck to the machinery space. A door complying with the requirements of § 42.15-10 is permitted in the machinery casing if it leads to a space or passageway which is as strongly constructed as the casing and is separated from the stairway to the engine room by a second weathertight door of steel or equivalent material.
              (b) Gangway and access. (1) An efficiently constructed fore and aft permanent gangway of sufficient strength shall be fitted on Type “A” vessels at the level of the superstructure deck between the poop and the midship bridge or deckhouse where fitted, or equivalent means of access shall be provided to carry out the purpose of the gangway, such as passages below deck. Elsewhere, and on Type “A” vessels without a midship bridge, arrangements to the satisfaction of the assigning authority shall be provided to safeguard the crew in reaching all parts used in the necessary work of the ship.
              (2) Safe and satisfactory access from the gangway level shall be available between separates crew accommodations and also between crew accommodations and the machinery space.
              (c) Hatchways. Exposed hatchways on the freeboard and forecastle decks or on the tops of expansion trunks on Type “A” vessels shall be provided with efficient watertight covers of steel or other equivalent material.
              (d) Freeing arrangements. (1) Type “A” vessels with bulwarks shall have open rails fitted for at least half the length of the exposed parts of the weather deck or other effective freeing arrangements. The upper edge of the sheer strake shall be kept as low as practicable.
              (2) Where superstructures are connected by trunks, open rails shall be fitted for the whole length of the exposed parts of the freeboard deck.

              Initial conditions of loading.
              When doing the calculations required in §§ 42.20-6(a), 42.20-7(a) and 42.20-8(a), the initial condition of loading before flooding must be assumed to be as specified in this section:
              (a) The vessel is assumed to be loaded to its summer load waterline with no trim.
              (b) When calculating the vertical center of gravity, the following assumptions apply:
              (1) The cargo is assumed to be homogeneous.
              (2) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all cargo compartments are assumed to be fully loaded. This includes compartments intended to be only partially filled. In the case of liquid cargoes, fully loaded means 98 percent full.
              (3) If the vessel is intended to operate at its summer load waterline with empty compartments, these empty compartments are assumed to be empty rather than fully loaded if the resulting height of the vertical center of gravity is not less than the height determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (4) Fifty percent of the total capacity of all tanks and spaces fitted to contain consumable liquids or stores must be assumed to be distributed to accomplish the following:
              (i) Each tank and space fitted to contain consumable liquids or stores must be assumed either completely empty or completely filled.
              (ii) The consumables must be distributed so as to produce the greatest possible height above the keel for the center of gravity.

              (5) Weights are calculated using the following values for specific gravities:

              (a) For each type of consumable liquid, the maximum free surface of at least one transverse pair of tanks or a single centerline tank must be included. The tank or combination of tanks must be that resulting in the greatest free surface effect.
              (b) For cargo liquids, unless the compartment is assumed to be empty as required by § 42.20-9(b)(3), the free surface of those compartments containing liquids is calculated at an angle of heel of not more than 5 degrees.

              (a) The vertical extent of damage in all cases must be assumed to be from the baseline upward without limit.
              
              (b) The transverse extent of damage is assumed to be equal to B/5 or 11.5 meters (37.7 feet), whichever is less. The transverse extent is measured inboard from the side of the ship perpendicularly to the center line at the level of the summer load waterline.
              (c) If damage of a lesser extent than that specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section results in a more severe condition, the lesser extent must be assumed.
              (d) The following assumptions apply to the transverse damage specified in paragraph (b) of this section for a stepped or recessed bulkhead:
              (1) A transverse watertight bulkhead that has a step or recess located within the transverse extent of assumed damage may be considered intact if the step or recess is not more than 3.05 meters (10 feet) in length.
              (2) If a transverse watertight bulkhead has a step or recess of more than 3.05 meters (10 feet) in length, within the transverse extent of assumed damage, the two compartments adjacent to this bulkhead must be considered as flooded.
              (3) If within the transverse extent of damage, a transverse bulkhead has a step or recess more than 3.05 meters (10 feet) in length that coincides with the double bottom tank top or the inner boundary of a wing tank, respectively, all adjacent compartments within the transverse extent of assumed damage must be considered to be flooded simultaneously.
              (e) If a wing tank has openings into adjacent compartments, the wing tank and adjacent compartments must be considered as one compartment. This provision applies even where these openings are fitted with closing appliances except:
              (1) Valves fitted in bulkheads between tanks which are controlled from above the bulkhead deck.
              (2) Secured manhole covers fitted with closely spaced bolts.
              (f) Only transverse watertight bulkheads that are spaced apart at least 1/3(L)2/3 or 14.5 meters (0.495(L)2/3 or 47.6 feet), whichever is less, may be considered effective. If transverse bulkheads are closer together, then one or more of these bulkheads must be assumed to be non-existent in order to achieve the minimum spacing between bulkheads.

              § 42.20-12
              Conditions of equilibrium.
              The following conditions of equilibrium are regarded as satisfactory:
              (a) Downflooding. The final waterline after flooding, taking into account sinkage, heel, and trim, is below the lower edge of any opening through which progressive flooding can take place. Such openings include air pipes, ventilators, and openings which are closed by means of weathertight doors (even if they comply with § 42.15-10) or covers (even if they comply with § 42.15-30 or § 42.15-45(d)) but may exclude those openings closed by means of:
              (1) Manhole covers and flush scuttles which comply with § 42.15-40;
              (2) Cargo hatch covers which comply with § 42.09-5(b);
              (3) Hinged watertight doors in an approved position which are secured closed while at sea and so logged; and
              (4) Remotely operated sliding watertight doors, and side scuttles of the non-opening type which comply with § 42.15-65.
              (b) Progressive flooding. If pipes, ducts, or tunnels are situated within the assumed extent of damage penetration as defined in § 42.20-11 (a) and (b), progressive flooding cannot extend to compartments other than those assumed to be floodable in the calculation for each case of damage.
              (c) Final angle of heel. The angle of heel due to unsymmetrical flooding does not exceed 15 degrees. If no part of the deck is immersed, an angle of heel of up to 17 degrees may be accepted.
              (d) Metacentric height. The metacentric height of the damaged vessel, in the upright condition, is positive.
              (e) Residual stability. Through an angle of 20 degrees beyond its position of equilibrium, the vessel must meet the following conditions:
              (1) The righting arm must be positive.
              (2) The maximum righting arm must be at least 0.1 meter (4 inches).

              (3) The area under the righting arm curve within the 20 degree range must not be less than 0.0175 meter-radians (0.689 inch-radians).
              (4) Each submerged opening must be weathertight (e.g. a vent fitted with a ball check valve).
              (f) Intermediate stages of flooding. The Commandant is satisfied that the stability is sufficient during intermediate stages of flooding.

              (a) A lighter, barge, or other vessel without independent means of propulsion is assigned a freeboard in accordance with the provisions of this subpart as modified by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
              (b) A barge that meets the requirements of § 42.09-5(b) may be assigned Type “A” freeboard if the barge does not carry deck cargo.
              (c) An unmanned barge is not required to comply with § 42.15-75, § 42.15-80(b), or § 42.20-70.
              (d) An unmanned barge that has only small access openings closed by watertight gasketed covers of steel or equivalent material on the freeboard deck, may be assigned a freeboard 25 percent less than that calculated in accordance with this subpart.

              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the length of a superstructure (S) shall be the mean length of the parts of the superstructure which lie within the length (L).

              (b) Where the end bulkhead of an enclosed superstructure extends in a fair convex curve beyond its intersection with the superstructure sides, the length of the superstructure may be increased on the basis of an equivalent plane bulkhead. This increase shall be two-thirds of the fore and aft extent of curvature. The maximum curvature which may be taken into account in determining this increase is one-half the breadth of the superstructure at the point of intersection of the curved end of the superstructure with its side.

              (a) Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section the effective length (E) of an enclosed superstructure of standard height shall be its length.

              (b) In all cases where an enclosed superstructure of standard height is set in from the sides of the vessel as permitted in § 42.13-15(j), the effective length shall be the length modified by the ratio of b/Bs,

              (1) Where a superstructure is set in for a part of its length, this modification shall be applied only to the set in part.
              (c) Where the height of an enclosed superstructure is less than the standard height, the effective length shall be its length reduced in the ratio of the actual height to the standard height. Where the height exceeds the standard, no increase shall be made to the effective length of the superstructure.

              (d) The effective length of a raised quarter deck if fitted with an intact front bulkhead, shall be its length up to a maximum of 0.6L. Where the bulkhead is not intact, the raised quarter deck shall be treated as a poop of less than standard height.

              Trunks.
              (a) A trunk or similar structure which does not extend to the sides of the vessel shall be regarded as efficient on the following conditions:
              (1) The trunk is at least as strong as a superstructure;
              (2) The hatchways are in the trunk deck, and the hatchway coamings and covers comply with the requirements of §§ 42.15-15 to 42.15-30, inclusive, and the width of the trunk deck stringer provides a satisfactory gangway and sufficient lateral stiffness; however, small access openings with watertight covers may be permitted in the freeboard deck;
              (3) A permanent working platform fore and aft fitted with guard rails is provided by the trunk deck, or by detached trunks connected to superstructures by efficient permanent gangways;
              (4) Ventilators are protected by the trunk by watertight covers or by other equivalent means;
              (5) Open rails are fitted on the weather parts of the freeboard deck in way of the trunk for at least half their length;
              (6) The machinery casings are protected by the trunk, by a superstructure of at least standard height, or by a deckhouse of the same height and of equivalent strength;
              (7) The breadth of the trunk is at least 60 percent of the breadth of the vessel; and,

              (8) Where there is no superstructure, the length of the trunk is at least 0.6L.
              

              (b) The full length of an efficient trunk reduced in the ratio of its mean breadth to B shall be its effective length.
              (c) The standard height of a trunk is the standard height of a superstructure other than a raised quarter deck.
              (d) Where the height of a trunk is less than the standard height, its effective length shall be reduced in the ratio of the actual to the standard height. Where the height of hatchway coamings on the trunk deck is less than that required under § 42.15-25(a), a reduction from the actual height of trunk shall be made which corresponds to the difference between the actual and required height of coaming.

              Sheer.
              (a) General. (1) The sheer shall be measured from the deck at side to a line of reference drawn parallel to the keel through the sheer line amidships.
              (2) In vessels designed with a rake of keel, the sheer shall be measured in relation to a reference line drawn parallel to the design load waterline.
              (3) In flush deck vessels and in vessels with detached superstructures the sheer shall be measured at the freeboard deck.
              (4) In vessels with topsides of unusual form in which there is a step or break in the topsides, the sheer shall be considered in relation to the equivalent depth amidships.

              (5) In vessels with a superstructure of standard height which extends over the whole length of the freeboard deck, the sheer shall be measured at the superstructure deck. Where the height exceeds the standard the least difference (Z) between the actual and standard heights shall be added to each end ordinate. Similarly, the intermediate ordinates at distances of 1/6
                L and 1/3
                L from each perpendicular shall be increased by 0.444Z and 0.111Z respectively.

              (6) Where the deck of an enclosed superstructure has at least the same sheer as the exposed freeboard deck, the sheer of the enclosed portion of the freeboard deck shall not be taken into account.
              
              (7) Where an enclosed poop or forecastle is of standard height with greater sheer than that of the freeboard deck, or is of more than standard height, an addition to the sheer of the freeboard deck shall be made as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
              (b) Standard sheer profile. (1) The ordinates of the standard sheer profile are given in table 42.20-65(b)(1):

              (c) Measurement of variation from standard sheer profile. (1) Where the sheer profile differs from the standard, the four ordinates of each profile in the forward or after half shall be multiplied by the appropriate factors given in the table of ordinates. The difference between the sums of the respective products and those of the standard divided by 8 measures the deficiency or excess of sheer in the forward or after half. The arithmetical mean of the excess or deficiency in the forward and after halves measures the excess or deficiency of sheer.
              (2) Where the after half of the sheer has an excess and the forward half of the sheer has a deficiency, no credit shall be allowed for the part in excess and deficiency only shall be measured.
              (3) Where the forward half of the sheer profile exceeds the standard, and the after portion of the sheer profile is not less than 75 percent of the standard, credit shall be allowed for the part in excess; where the after part is less than 50 percent of the standard, no credit shall be given for the excess sheer forward. Where the after sheer is between 50 percent and 75 percent of the standard, intermediate allowances may be granted for excess sheer forward.

              (4) Where sheer credit is given for a poop or forecastle, the following formula shall be used:
              
              
                s = (y/3)(L′/L)
              
              
                where:
                
                
                  s = sheer credit, to be deducted from the deficiency or added to the excess of sheer.
                
                  y = difference between actual and standard height of superstructure at the end ordinate.
                
                  L′ = mean enclosed length of poop or forecastle up to a maximum length of 0.5L.
                
                
                  L = length of vessel as defined in § 42.13-15(a).
              
              
              (i) The formula in this paragraph (c)(4) of this section provides a curve in the form of a parabola tangent to the actual sheer curve at the freeboard deck and intersecting the end ordinate at a point below the superstructure deck a distance equal to the standard height of a superstructure. The superstructure deck shall not be less than standard height above this curve at any point. This curve shall be used in determining the sheer profile for forward and after halves of the vessel.
              (d) Correction for variations from standard sheer profile. (1) The correction for sheer shall be the deficiency or excess of sheer (see paragraphs (c) (1) to (4) inclusive of this section) multiplied by:
              
              0.75−(S/2L)
              
              
                where:
                
                
                  S is the total length of enclosed superstructures.
              
              
              (e) Addition for deficiency in sheer. (1) Where the sheer is less than the standard, the correction for deficiency in sheer (see paragraph (d)(1) of this section) shall be added to the freeboard.
              (f) Deduction for excess sheer. (1) In vessels where an enclosed superstructure covers 0.1L before and 0.1L abaft amidships, the correction for excess of sheer as calculated under the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be deducted from the freeboard; in vessels where no enclosed superstructure covers amidships, no deduction shall be made from the freeboard; where an enclosed superstructure covers less than 0.1L before and 0.1L abaft amidships, the deduction shall be obtained by linear interpolation. The maximum deduction for excess sheer shall be at the rate of 11/2 inches per 100 feet of length.

              § 42.25-5
              Definitions of terms used in this subpart.
              (a) Timber deck cargo. The term “timber deck cargo” means a cargo of timber carried on an uncovered part of a freeboard or superstructure deck. The term does not include wood pulp or similar cargo.
              (b) Timber load line. A timber deck cargo may be regarded as giving a vessel a certain additional buoyancy and a greater degree of protection against the sea. For that reason, vessels carrying a timber deck cargo may be granted a reduction of freeboard calculated according to the provisions of § 42.25-20 and marked on the vessel's side in accordance with the provisions of § 42.13-30(c) and (d). However, in order that such special freeboard may be granted and used, the timber deck cargo shall comply with certain conditions which are laid down in § 42.25-15, and the vessel itself shall also comply with certain conditions relating to its construction which are set out in § 42.25-10.
              [CGFR 68-60, 33 FR 10067, July 12, 1968, as amended by CGFR 68-126, 34 FR 9016, June 5, 1969]

              Construction of vessel.
              (a) Superstructure. (1) Vessels, shall have a forecastle of at least standard height and a length of at least 0.07L. In addition, if the vessel is less than 328 feet in length, a poop of at least standard height, or a raised quarter deck with either a deckhouse or a strong steel hood of at least the same total height shall be fitted aft.
              (b) Double bottom tanks. (1) Double bottom tanks where fitted within the midship half length of the vessel shall have adequate watertight longitudinal subdivision.
              (c) Bulwarks. (1) The vessel shall be fitted either with permanent bulwarks at least 391/2 inches in height, specially stiffened on the upper edge and supported by strong bulwark stays attached to the deck and provided with necessary freeing ports, or with efficient rails of the same height and of specially strong construction.

              (a) General. (1) Openings in the weather deck over which cargo is stowed shall be securely closed and battened down. The ventilators shall be efficiently protected.
              (2) Timber deck cargo shall extend over at least the entire available length which is the total length of the well or wells between superstructures. Where there is no limiting superstructure at the after end, the timber shall extend at least to the after end of the aftermost hatchway. The timber shall be stowed as solidly as possible, to at least the standard height of a superstructure other than a raised quarter deck.

              (3) On a vessel within a seasonal winter zone in winter, the height of the deck cargo above the weather deck shall not exceed one-third of the extreme breadth of the vessel.
              
              (4) The timber deck cargo shall be compactly stowed, lashed, and secured. It shall not interfere in any way with the navigation and necessary work of the vessel.
              (b) Upright. (1) Uprights, when required by the nature of the timber, shall be of adequate strength considering the breadth of the vessel; the spacing shall be suitable for the length and character of timber carried, but shall not exceed 9.8 feet. Strong angles or metal sockets or equally efficient means shall be provided for securing the uprights.
              (c) Lashings. (1) Timber deck cargo shall be efficiently secured throughout its length by independent overall lashings spaced not more than 9.8 feet apart. Eye plates for these lashings shall be efficiently attached to the sheer strake or to the deck stringer plate at intervals of not more than 9.8 feet. The distance from an end bulkhead of a superstructure to the first eye plate shall be not more than 6.6 feet. Eye plates and lashings shall be provided 231/2 inches and 4.9 feet from the ends of timber deck cargoes where there is no bulkhead.
              (2) Lashings shall be not less than 3/4-inch close link chain or flexible wire rope of equivalent strength, fitted with sliphooks and turnbuckles, which shall be accessible at all times. Wire rope lashings shall have a short length of long link chain to permit the length of lashings to be regulated.
              (3) When timber is in lengths less than 11.8 feet the spacing of the lashings shall be reduced or other suitable provisions made to suit the length of timber.
              (4) All fittings required for securing the lashings shall be of strength corresponding to the length of the lashings.
              (d) Stability. (1) Provision shall be made for a safe margin of stability at all stages of the voyage, regard being given to additions of weight, such as those due to absorption of water and icing and to losses of weight such as those due to consumption of fuel and stores.
              (e) Protection of crew, access to machinery spaces, etc. (1) In addition to the requirements of § 42.15-75(e) guardrails or life lines spaced not more than 13 inches apart vertically shall be provided on each side of the deck cargo to a height of at least 391/2 inches above the cargo.
              (f) Steering arrangements. (1) Steering arrangements shall be effectively protected from damage by cargo and, as far as practicable, shall be accessible. Efficient provision, shall be made for steering in the event of a breakdown in the main steering arrangements.

              (a) In assigning load lines to an existing vessel the provisions of the regulations in this part shall be complied with in principle and detail insofar as is reasonable and practicable, having regard to the proven efficacy of existing arrangements for a special service voyage, and having particular regard to the provision of sufficient means for the protection and safety of the crew.

              (b) Where it is neither reasonable nor practicable to comply with this part in its entirety, the assigning authority will, in each case, report to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, the specific matters in which the vessel is deficient with such recommendations as may seem desirable. Upon the receipt of this report the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, shall determine such addition to the freeboard as will, in the judgment of the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, make the vessel as safe as if it had fully complied with this part.
            
            
              § 44.05-20
              Conditions of assignment.
              (a) Steam colliers. The conditions of assignment for steam colliers shall be in accordance with the requirements of part 42 of this subchapter, except that in the case of steam colliers constructed with bulwarks, the freeing port may be of a practically continuous slot type, located as low as possible, the clear area of the slot to be not less than 20 percent of the superficial area of the unpierced bulwarks. If, due to sheer, or other conditions, the assigning authority considers that extra local provision should be made for freeing decks of water, the slots are to be located so as to have maximum efficacy.
              (b) Towed barges. The conditions of assignment for towed cargo barges where the cargo is carried under deck shall be in accordance with §§ 45.10-5 to 45.10-100 of this subchapter. In the case of tank barges and cargo barges carrying cargo only on deck, compliance will also be required with the supplementary conditions of §§ 45.20-1 to 45.20-70 of this subchapter. In the case of cargo barges of the open type, assignment will be limited to barges in unmanned operation and the construction of the vessel must be such as to satisfy the assigning authority that no unusual hazards will be experienced.
              (c) Self-propelled barges. The conditions of assignment for self-propelled cargo barges carrying cargo under decks shall be in accordance with the provisions of §§ 45.10-5 to 45.10-100 of this subchapter. In the case of self-propelled tank barges and self-propelled cargo barges carrying cargo only on deck, compliance will also be required with the supplementary conditions of §§ 45.20-1 to 45.20-70 of this subchapter.

              § 44.05-25
              Freeboards.
              (a) General. (1) When the assigning authority is satisfied that the requirements of this part as applicable to the type of vessel under consideration are complied with the freeboards will be computed as described in this section.
              (2) The requirements in §§ 42.09-1 and 42.09-10 that relate to the assignment of freeboards and to stability are applicable to each vessel subject to the requirements in this part.
              (3) The assigning authority that assigns a vessel subject to the requirements in this part a freeboard under part 45 of this chapter shall do so in accordance with the requirements in effect as of October 1, 1972.
              (b) Steam colliers. Steam colliers that have constructional features similar to those of a tanker which afford extra invulnerability against the sea may be assigned a reduction of freeboard from that determined under part 42 of this subchapter. The amount of such reduction shall be determined by the assigning authority, in relation to the freeboard assigned to tankers, having regard to the degree of compliance with the supplementary conditions of assignment laid down for these ships, but without regard to the degree of subdivision provided. The freeboard assigned to such a vessel shall in no case be less than would be assigned the vessel as a tanker, as determined under part 42 of this subchapter.
              (c) Towed cargo barges with cargo under deck. The freeboard is to be computed under §§ 45.15-1 to 45.15-97 of this subchapter. The fresh water and seasonal markings where applicable are to be determined under part 42 of this subchapter.
              (d) Towed cargo barges with cargo only on deck. The freeboard for barges of this type is to be computed in accordance with the requirements of §§ 45.20-1 to 45.20-70 of this subchapter. The fresh water and seasonal markings where applicable are to be the same as determined under part 42 of this subchapter.
              (e) Towed cargo barges of the open type. The load line shall be placed where, in the judgment of the assigning authority, the draft will be such that no unusual hazard will be experienced. In general, drafts assigned will be such that the barge will remain afloat with a reasonable freeboard after flooding of the net available open space.
              (f) Towed tank barges. The freeboard is to be computed in accordance with §§ 45.20-1 to 45.20-70 of this subchapter. The fresh water and seasonal markings where applicable are to be determined under part 42 of this subchapter.
              (g) Self-propelled cargo barges. The freeboard is to be computed under §§ 45.15-1 to 45.20-15 of this subchapter. The fresh water and seasonal markings where applicable are to be determined under part 42 of this subchapter.
              (h) Self-propelled tank barges. The freeboard is to be computed in accordance with §§ 45.20-1 to 45.20-70 of this subchapter. The fresh water and seasonal markings where applicable are to be determined under part 42 of this subchapter.

              § 45.1
              Purpose.
              This part prescribes requirements for assignment of freeboards, issuance of loadline certificates, and marking of loadlines for service on the Great Lakes of North America.
              [CGD 73-49R, 38 FR 12290, May 10, 1973, as amended by USCG-1998-4442, 63 FR 52190, Sept. 30, 1998]
            
            
              § 45.3
              Definitions.
              As used in this part:
              (a) Length (L) means 96 percent of the total length on a waterline at 85 percent of the least moulded depth measured from the top of the keel or the length from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, if that is greater. In ships designed with a rake of keel the waterline on which this length is measured must be parallel to the designed waterline.
              (b) Perpendiculars means the forward and after perpendiculars at the forward and after ends of the length (L). The forward perpendicular coincides with the foreside of the stem on the waterline on which the length is measured.
              (c) Amidships means the middle of the length (L).
              (d) Breadth unless expressly provided otherwise, means the maximum breadth of the ship, measured amidships to the moulded line of the frame in a ship with a metal shell and to the outer surface of the hull in a ship with a shell of any other material.
              (e) Moulded Depth means the vertical distance measured amidships from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side except that—
              (1) In vessels of other than metal construction, the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet;
              (2) Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the distance is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel;
              (3) In ships having rounded gunwales, this distance is measured to the point of intersection of the moulded lines of the deck and side, the lines extending as though the gunwale were of angular design; and
              (4) Where the freeboard deck is stepped and the raised part of the deck extends over the point at which the moulded depth is to be determined, the distance is measured to a line of reference extending from the lower part of the deck along a line parallel with the raised part.
              (f) Depth for Freeboard (D) means—
              (1) Moulded depth amidships plus the thickness of the stringer plate with no allowance for sheathing; and
              (2) In a vessel having a rounded gunwale with a radius greater than 4 percent of the breadth (B) or having topsides of unusual form, the depth for freeboard (D) of a vessel having a midship section with vertical topsides and with the same round of beam and area of topside section equal to that provided by the actual midship section.
              (g) Freeboard means the distance measured vertically downwards amidships from the upper edge of the deck line to the upper edge of the related load line.
              (h) Freeboard Deck means, normally, the uppermost complete deck exposed to weather and sea that has permanent means of closing all openings in the weather part thereof and below which all openings in the sides of the ship are fitted with permanent means of watertight closings except that—

              (1) In a ship having a discontinuous freeboard deck, the lowest line of the exposed deck and the continuation of that line parallel to the upper part of the deck is the freeboard deck.
              
              (2) At the option of the owner and subject to the approval of the Commandant a lower deck may be designated as the freeboard deck, if it is a complete and permanent deck continuous in a fore and aft direction at least between the machinery space and peak bulkheads and continuous athwartships;
              (3) When this lower deck is stepped the lowest line of the deck and the continuation of that line parallel to the upper part of the deck is taken as the freeboard deck.
              (i) Superstructure means a deck structure on the freeboard deck, extending from side to side of the ship or with the side plating not being inboard of the shell plating more than 4 percent of the breadth (B). A raised quarterdeck is a superstructure.
              (j) Enclosed superstructure means a superstructure with enclosing bulkheads.
              (k) Height of a superstructure means the least vertical height measured at side from the top of the superstructure deck beams to the top of the freeboard deck beams.
              (l) Length of a superstructure (S) means the mean length of the part of the superstructure which extends to the sides of the vessel and lies within the length (L).
              (m) Flush deck ship means a ship that has no superstructure on the freeboard deck.
              (n) Weathertight means that in any sea conditions water will not penetrate into the ship.
              (o) Watertight means designed to withstand a static head of water.
              (p) Exposed positions means exposed to weather and sea.
              (q) Intact bulkhead with respect to superstructure means a bulkhead with no openings.
              (r) Steel means steel and materials with which structures can be made equivalent to steel with respect to such parameters as yield strength, total deflection, flexural life, or resistance to galvanic or stress corrosion.

              § 45.15
              Exemptions.
              (a) The Commandant may exempt a ship from any of the requirements in this part if the chairman of the board of Steamship Inspections, Department of Transport, Canada, and the Commandant agree that the sheltered nature or the condition of that voyage make it unreasonable or impracticable to apply requirements of this part.
              (b) The Commandant may exempt a vessel that embodies features of a novel kind from any of the requirements of this part if those requirements might seriously impede research into the development of such features and their incorporation in ships. Any such vessel must comply with the safety requirements that, in the opinion of the Commandant, are adequate for the service for which the vessel is intended and will insure the overall safety of the vessel. If the Commandant grants an exemption pursuant to this paragraph he communicates the details of the exemption and the reasons therefor to the chairman of the board of Steamship Inspections.
              (c) A vessel that is not normally engaged on voyages to which this part applies but that, in exceptional circumstances, is required to undertake a single such voyage between two specific ports may be exempted by the Commandant from any of the requirements of this part, if the ship complies with safety requirements that, in the opinion of the Commandant are adequate for the voyage that is to be undertaken by the vessel.
              (d) Unmanned dry cargo river barges carrying non-hazardous cargoes on certain routes on Lake Michigan may be exempted from load line requirements in accordance with the conditions specified in subpart E of this part.

                  1 is defined by § 45.55 and D is the depth for freeboard in feet.
              
              
              (c) Seasonal freeboards assigned under §§ 45.71 through 45.75 must be calculated on the basis of the summer freeboard calculated under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.
              (d) If a minimum freeboard is required for a vessel under this part which is greater than that required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section because of scantling or subdivision requirements, the summer freeboard and the seasonal freeboards assigned under this subpart must be no less than that minimum freeboard, except the midsummer seasonal freeboard may be calculated on the basis of the summer freeboard assigned under this paragraph.
              (e) If a greater than the calculated minimum freeboard is requested by the applicant for the load line certificate, that greater freeboard may be assigned as the summer freeboard and—
              (1) The intermediate and winter seasonal freeboards assigned must be calculated under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section; and
              (2) The midsummer seasonal freeboard must be calculated on the basis of the summer freeboard assigned under this paragraph.
            
            
              § 45.55
              Freeboard coefficient.
              (a) For ships less than 350 feet in length (L), the freeboard coefficient is P
                1 in the formula:
              
              
                P
                1=P + A[(L/D)-(L/D
                s)]
              
              
                where P is a factor, which is a function of the length from table 1 and “A” is a coefficient, which is a function of length (L), from table 2; L/D is the ratio of the length (L) to the depth for freeboard (D); L/D
                  s is the ratio of the length (L) to a standard depth (D
                  s) from table 3.
                
                  D is not to be used as less than that which will give a ration of L to D that is:
                (a) More than 15 when L = 400 feet or less, or
                (b) More than 21 when L = 700 feet or more, with the ratio for intermediate lengths being calculated proportionately.
              
              
              (b) For ships 350 feet or more in length (L), the coefficient “A” is zero and the formula is:
              
              
                P
                1=P
              
              
              
                
                where P is a factor, which is a function of length from table (1).
              
            
            
              § 45.57
              Correction: Position of deckline.
              (a) Where the depth to the upper edge of the deckline is greater or less than D, the difference between the depths must be added to or deducted from the freeboard.
              (b) When the Commandant or the approved assigning authority approves a location for the deckline that is above or below the freeboard deck, the minimum summer freeboard must be corrected by—
              (1) Adding the difference between the depth and D if the depth is greater than D; and
              (2) Subtracting the difference between the depth and D, if the depth is less than D.
              (c) Except for the adjustment allowed in paragraph (b) of this section, no freeboard of less than 2 in. may be assigned.
            
            
              § 45.58
              Correction: Short superstructure.

              The minimum freeboard in summer for a type B vessel that is 79 ft. or more but less than 500 ft. in length and has enclosed superstructures with an effective length of 25 percent or less of the length of the vessel must be increased by—
              
              0.03 (500—L) (0.25—E/L) inches
              
              
                where:
                
                (L) = length of vessel in feet;
                (E) = effective length of superstructure in feet as defined in § 45.59.
              
            
            
              § 45.59
              Definitions for superstructure corrections.
              For the purpose of §§ 45.58 through 45.61—
              (a) The standard height of a superstructure (H
                s) other than a raised quarter deck and the standard height of a trunk (H
                s) is determined by the formula:
              
              
                H
                s=[6.0 + (L/300)] ft
              
              (b) The length of superstructure (S) is the length of those parts of the superstructure which extends to the sides of the vessel and that lie within the length (L).
              (c) The effective length (E) of a trunk is its length in the ratio of its mean breadth to B.
              
              (d) The effective length (E) of an enclosed superstructure of standard height or greater is its length “S”.

              (e) Where the height of an enclosed superstructure or trunk is less than the standard height (H
                s),the effective length (E) is its length reduced in the ratio of its height to H
                s.
              (f) The effective length (E) of a raised quarter deck of 2/3
                H
                s or greater that has no openings in the front bulkhead is its length up to a maximum of 0.6L.
              
              (g) The effective length (E) of a raised quarter deck of less than 2/3
                H
                s or that does not have an intact front bulkhead is its length reduced by the ratio of its height to H
                s.

              (i) When a lower deck is designated as the freeboard deck, that part of the hull which extends above the freeboard deck is treated as a superstructure so far as concerns the application of the conditions of assignment and the calculation of freeboard.
              
              (j) A bridge or poop is enclosed only when access is provided whereby the crew may reach accommodations, machinery, or other working spaces inside the superstructure by alternative means that are available at all times when bulkhead openings are closed.
            
            
              § 45.61
              Correction for superstructures and trunks.
              (a) Where the effective length E of superstructures and trunks that meet the requirements of subpart D of this part is 1.0L, the minimum summer freeboard may be corrected by subtracting 1/2Hs.

              (b) Where the effective length of superstructures and trunks is less than 1.0L the minimum summer freeboard may be corrected by subtracting a percentage of one-half of the standard superstructure height (H
                s) determined by the formula:
              
              Percentage = (E/2L) (1 + E/L) × 100
              
              (c) To be eligible for the correction a trunk must—
              (1) Be at least as strong and as stiff as a superstructure;
              (2) Have no opening in the freeboard deck in way of the trunk, except small access openings;
              (3) Have hatchway coamings and covers that meet §§ 45.143 through 45.147;
              (4) Provide a permanent working platform fore and aft with guardrails;
              (5) Provide fore and aft access between detached trunks and superstructures by permanent gangways;
              (6) Be at least 60 percent of the breadth of the ship in way of the trunk; and
              (7) Be at least 0.6 L in length, if no superstructure, is provided.
            
            
              § 45.63
              Correction for sheer.

              (a) The minimum summer freeboard must be increased by the deficiency, or may be decreased by the excess as limited by § 45.65, of sheer calculated from table 4, multiplied by:
              
              0.75—(S/2L)
              
              
                where S is the total length of enclosed superstructures. Trunks are not included.
              
            
            
              § 45.65
              Excess sheer limitations.
              The decrease in freeboard allowed in § 45.63 is limited as follows:

              (a) In vessels having no enclosed superstructure from 0.1 L abaft amidships to 0.1 L forward of amidships, no decrease is allowed.

              (b) In vessels having enclosed superstructures amidships less than 0.1 L before and abaft amidships, the decrease must be reduced by linear interpolation.
              (c) If excess sheer exists in the forward half, and the after half is at least 75 percent of standard sheer, the full decrease is allowed. If the after sheer is between 50 percent and 75 percent of standard sheer an intermediate decrease, determined by linear interpolation, is allowed for the excess sheer forward. If the after sheer is 50 percent of standard or less, no decrease is allowed for the excess sheer forward.

              (d) Where an enclosed poop or forecastle is of standard height with greater sheer than that of the freeboard deck, or is greater than standard height, an addition to the sheer of the freeboard deck may be made using the following formula:
              
              S=vL′/3L
              
              
              
                Where
                
                
                  s = sheer credit, to be deducted from the deficiency or added to the excess of sheer.
                
                  v = difference between actual and standard height of superstructure at the end ordinate.
                
                  L′ = mean enclosed length of poop or forecastle up to a maximum length of 0.5 L.
                
              
              
              The superstructure deck must not be less than standard height above this curve at any point. This curve must be used in determining the sheer profile for forward and after halves of the vessel.
              (e) The maximum decreased for excess sheer must be no more than 11/2 inches per 100 feet of length.
              (f) Where the deck of an enclosed superstructure has at least the same sheer as the exposed freeboard deck, the sheer of the enclosed portion of the freeboard deck cannot be taken into account.
            
            
              § 45.67
              Sheer measurement.
              (a) The sheer is measured from the freeboard deck at side to a line of reference drawn parallel to the keel through the sheer line at amidships;
              (b) In ships designed with a rake of keel or designed to trim by the stern, the sheer must be measured in reference to a line drawn through the sheer line at amidships parallel to the design load waterline.
              (c) In flush deck ships and in ships with detached superstructures, the sheer must be measured at the freeboard deck.
              (d) In ships with a step or break in the topsides, the sheer must be measured from the equivalent depth amidships.
              (e) In vessels with a superstructure of standard height that extends over the whole length of the freeboard deck, the sheer must be measured on the superstructure deck. Where the height of superstructure exceeds the standard, the least difference (Z) between the actual and standard heights must be added to each end ordinate. Similarly, the intermediate ordinates at distance of 1/6
                L and 1/3
                L from each perpendicular must be increased by 0.444 Z and 0.111 Z respectively.
            
            
              § 45.69
              Correction for bow height.
              (a) The minimum summer freeboard of all manned vessels must be increased by the same amount in inches as any deficiency which may be shown by the following formulas:

              (1) For vessels having a length of not less than 79 feet and not greater than 550 feet,
              
              
                0.593 L (1.0-L/1640) inches—actual bow height
              
              

              (2) For vessels having a length greater than 550 feet,
              
              
                (341.6—0.227 L) inches—actual bow height
              
              
              (b) Where the bow height is obtained by sheer, the sheer must extend for at least 15 percent of the length of the vessel measured from the forward perpendicular.

              (c) Where the bow height is obtained by a superstructure, the superstructure must be enclosed and extend from the stem to a point at least 0.06 L abaft the forward perpendicular.

              (d) Vessels which, to suit exceptional operational requirements, cannot meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section may be given special consideration by the Commandant.
              
              (e) The bow height is defined as the vertical distance at the forward perpendicular between the waterline corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard at the designed trim and the top of the exposed deck at side.

              Midsummer freeboard.

              The minimum midsummer freeboard (fms) in inches is obtained by the formula:
              
              
                fms = f(s) − 0.3Ts
              
              
                where:
                
                
                  f(s) = summer freeboard in inches
                Ts = distance in feet between top of keel and the summer load line.

              The minimum winter freeboard (fw) in inches is obtained by the formula:
              
              
                fw=f(s) + T s (200)/L
              
              
              
                where:
                
                L = length L in feet but not less than 400 feet.

              Intermediate freeboard.
              The minimum intermediate freeboard (fI) in inches is obtained by the formula:
              
              
                f
                I=f(s) + T s(100)/L
              
              
              
                where:
                
                L = length L in feet but not less than 400 feet.
              
            
            
              § 45.77
              Salt water freeboard.

              (a) The salt water addition in inches to freeboard applicable to each fresh water mark is obtained by the formula:
              
              Addition=Δ/41T
              
              
                where:
                
                Δ = displacement in fresh water, in tons of 2,240 pounds, at the summer load waterline.
                T = tons per inch immersion, of 2,240 pounds, in fresh water at the summer load waterline.
              
              
              (b) When the displacement at the summer load waterline cannot be certified, the addition in inches to the minimum freeboard in fresh water may be obtained by multiplying 0.25 by the summer draught in feet measured from the top of the keel to the center of the load line diamond.
            
          
          
            Subpart D—Conditions of Assignment
            
              § 45.101
              Purpose.
              This subpart prescribes conditions that a vessel must meet to be eligible for assignment of a loadline under this part.
            
            
              § 45.103
              Structural stress and stability.
              (a) The nature and stowage of the cargo, ballast, and other variable weights must be such as to make the vessel stable and avoid unacceptable structural stress.
              (b) The vessel must meet all applicable stability and subdivision requirements of this chapter.
            
            
              § 45.105
              Information supplied to the master.
              Unless otherwise authorized by the Commandant, the vessel must have onboard, in a form approved by the Commandant, sufficient information.
              (a) To enable the master to load and ballast the vessel in a manner that avoids unacceptable stresses in the vessel's structure; and
              (b) To guide the master as to the stability of the ship under varying conditions of service.
            
            
              § 45.107
              Strength of hull.
              The general structural strength of the hull must be sufficient for the draught corresponding to the freeboard assigned and must be approved by the Commandant. Ships built and maintained in conformity with the requirements of a classification society may be recognized by the Commandant as possessing adequate strength.
            
            
              § 45.109
              Strength of superstructures and deckhouses.
              Each superstructure or deckhouse used for accommodations of the crew must be approved by the Commandant or the approved assigning authority with regard to general strength and weathertightness. The Commandant may use the requirements of the assigning authority as a guide.
            
            
              § 45.111
              Strength of bulkheads at ends of superstructures.

              Bulkheads at ends of enclosed superstructures must have sufficient strength to withstand impact of boarding seas.
            
            
              § 45.113
              Access openings in bulkheads at ends of enclosed superstructures.
              (a) Access openings in bulkheads at ends of enclosed superstructures must have doors of steel or material as strong as steel that are permanently attached to the bulkhead and framed, stiffened, and fitted so that the bulkhead and door are as strong as the bulkhead and weather tight when closed.
              (b) The means for securing the doors weathertight must be permanently attached to the doors or bulkheads and arranged so that the doors can be secured weathertight from both sides of the bulkhead.
              (c) Access openings in bulkheads at ends of enclosed superstructures must have sills that are at least 12 inches above the deck.
            
            
              § 45.115
              Bulwarks and guardrails.
              (a) The exposed parts of freeboard and superstructures decks and deckhouses on the freeboard deck must have guardrails or bulwarks that are at least 36 inches high above the deck.
              (b) Guardrails must have at least three courses with no more than a 9-inch opening below the lowest course and no more than 15 inches between other courses.

              Freeing port area: General.
              (a) Where bulwarks on the weather portions of freeboard or superstructure decks form wells, the bulwarks must have the area prescribed in this section and §§ 45.119 and 45.121 for rapidly freeing and draining the decks of water.
              (b) Except as required in §§ 45.119 and 45.121 the minimum freeing port area in square feet on each side of the ship for each well on the freeboard deck and on the raised quarterdeck must be at least as great as A in the following formulas:
              (1) Where the length of bulwark (l) in the well is 66 feet or less, A = 7.6 + 0.115 (l)
              (2) Where (l) exceeds 66 feet, A = 0.23 (l)
              but (l) need in no case be taken as greater than 0.7L.
              (c) In ships having erections on deck that are open at either or both ends, provision for freeing the space within such erections must be approved by the Commandant or the assigning authority.
              (d) The lower edges of the freeing ports must be as near the deck as practicable. Two-thirds of the freeing port area required must be provided in the half of the well nearest the lowest point of the sheer curve.
              (e) All freeing port openings in the bulwarks must be protected by rails or bars spaced approximately 9 inches. If shutters are fitted to freeing ports, ample clearance must be provided to prevent jamming. Hinges must have pins or bearings of noncorrodible material. If shutters are fitted with securing appliances, these appliances must be of approved construction.
              (f) The minimum freeing port area for each well on superstructure decks must be one-half of the area required by paragraph (b) of this section.

              notes

              (1) In accordance with the Great Lakes Load Line Regulations the diamond and lines must be permanently marked. The “MS” loadline shall be assigned only to those particular vessels that qualify under the regulations.
              (2) The “SW” marks need only be assigned to Great Lakes vessels loading in salt water of the St. Lawrence River west of a straight line from Cap de Rosiers to West Point Anticosti Island, and west of a line along longitude 63 degrees west from Anticosti Island to the north shore of the St. Lawrence River. In such cases these limits shall be indicated on the certificate.
              (3) The load line assignment given by this certificate necessarily assumes that the nature and stowage of cargo, ballast, etc., are such as to secure sufficient stability for the vessel. Accordingly, it is the owner's responsibility to furnish the Master of the vessel with stability information and instructions when this is necessary to maintenance of sufficient stability.
              (On the reverse side of the load line certificate, or on a separate sheet, attached and forming part of the certificate, provision is to be made for annual inspection and renewal endorsements.)

              § 46.15-10
              Subdivision load lines.
              (a) Subdivision load lines shall be located by measuring vertically down from the deck line required by part 42 of this subchapter.
              (b) The length, width, and manner of marking the lines shall be as provided in subpart 42.13 of this subchapter.
              (c) No subdivision load line is to be placed so that the freeboard is reduced from that determined by the highest seasonal mark permitted by part 42.
              (d) When the highest subdivision load line is located on a vessel used as a passenger vessel in a position between the highest and lowest seasonal load line marks, the seasonal load line marks above the subdivision load line will be omitted and those below will be marked.
              (e) When the freeboard from the highest subdivision load line on a vessel used as a passenger vessel is greater than the freeboard from the lowest load line permitted by part 42 of this subchapter, the load lines required by part 42 of this subchapter shall be omitted and the disk with its horizontal line located in line with the highest subdivision load line.

              (f) One fresh water line shall be marked. When a subdivision and a normal load line are combined, the normal fresh water line only shall be used unless the position of the subdivision load line is such that confusion will result, in which case a subdivision fresh water line may be used, marked FC1 and the normal fresh water line omitted.
              (g) Subdivision load lines shall be aft of the vertical line. The vertical line shall be extended as necessary to connect the lowest and highest load lines marked on the vessel.

              (h) When a vessel has spaces used for cargo and passengers alternatively so that the position of the subdivision load line varies with the service, subdivision load lines for the principal passenger condition shall be marked and denoted by C1 and the alternative conditions marked and denoted by C2, C3, etc. The position of each load line and the conditions under which a particular load line is applicable shall be noted in the certificate.

              (i) The principal passenger condition for a vessel having spaces used for passengers and cargo alternatively is the condition where only those spaces appropriated exclusively to passengers are taken into consideration for determination of the subdivision load line.
              
              (j) For Great Lakes vessels, references to part 42 shall read part 45 and a “diamond” shall be substituted for the “disk”. No “fresh water” line will be marked.

              § 50.20-1
              General.
              (a) The required vessel, equipment, or installation plans, as listed in this subchapter, are general in character, but include all plans which normally show the intended construction and safety features coming under the cognizance of the Coast Guard. In a particular case, however, not all of the plans enumerated may be applicable, and in such cases the Coast Guard will so notify the submitter.
              (b) Manufacturers of pressure vessels and other components, which require specific fabrication inspection in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter, shall submit and obtain approval of the applicable construction plans prior to the commencement of such fabrication. Manufacturers of automatically controlled boilers shall submit and obtain approval of the applicable control system plans prior to installation of the boiler. Manufacturers of boilers which must meet the requirements of part 52 of this subchapter shall submit the applicable construction plans for review prior to installation.

              § 50.20-5
              Procedures for submittal of plans.
              (a) As the relative locations of shipyards, design offices, and Coast Guard offices vary throughout the country, no specific routing will be required in the submittal of plans. In general, one of the procedures outlined in this section apply, but if a more expeditious procedure can be used, there will normally be no objection to it.
              (b) The plans may be submitted in duplicate to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, at or nearest the place where the vessel is to be built. Alternatively, the plans may be submitted in triplicate to the Marine Safety Center.
              (c) In the case of classed vessels, upon specific request by the submitter, the American Bureau of Shipping will arrange to forward the necessary plans to the Coast Guard indicating its action thereon. In this case, the plans will be returned directly to the submitter as noted in paragraph (c) of this section.

              (3) Watertube boiler. A watertube boiler is a steam boiler in which the boiler tubes contain water and steam. The heat is applied to the outside surface of the tubes.
              (4) Internally fired firetube boiler (scotch boiler). An internally fired firetube boiler is a steam boiler containing furnaces, one or more combustion chambers and tubes or flues, which are surrounded by water and through which the products of combustion pass from the furnace to the uptake. In such boilers no part of the shell is in contact with the fire or products of combustion.
              (5) Externally fired firetube or flue boiler (horizontal return tubular). An externally fired firetube or flue boiler is a steam boiler, part of the outer shell of which is exposed to fire or to the products of combustion, and containing flues through which such products pass from the furnace to the uptake.
              (6) High temperature water boiler. A high temperature water boiler is a boiler containing water at a temperature exceeding 250 °F.
              (7) Packaged boiler. A packaged boiler is a steam boiler equipped, and shipped complete with fuel burning equipment, mechanical draft equipment, feed water apparatus and all necessary controls for manual or automatic operation, all completely mounted on a common base and requiring only to be connected to fuel, water and electric supplies to be ready for use.
              (8) Fired steam boiler. A pressure vessel in which steam is generated by the application of heat resulting from the combustion of fuel is classed as a fired steam boiler.
              (9) Unfired steam boiler. A pressure vessel in which steam is generated by means other than fuel combustion is classed as an unfired steam boiler. (See § 54.01-10 of this subchapter.)
              (10) Hybrid boiler. A hybrid boiler is a steam boiler whose design employs features from both watertube and firetube boilers.
              
              (b) Parts of boilers—(1) Shell. The shell is the structure forming the outer envelope of a boiler drum, or pressure vessel consisting of one or more plates properly joined (or of seamless construction) as specified in this part. This does not include tube sheets or heads.
              (2) Heads. The heads are the ends of a boiler or pressure vessel. They may be flat or dished, stayed or unstayed.
              (i) Dished heads. Dished heads are heads formed to a segment of a sphere or to a hemispherical or elliptical section and may be attached to the shell so that the pressure will be either on the concave or on the convex side.
              (ii) Stayed heads. Stayed heads are heads supported in whole or in part by stays, furnaces, flues, tubes, etc.
              (3) Water wall. A water wall is a series of tubes or elements spaced along or integral with a wall of a furnace to protect the wall and provide additional heating surface.
              (4) Header. A header is a hollow forging, pipe, or welded plate of cylindrical, square, or rectangular cross section, serving as a manifold to which tubes are connected.
              (5) Superheater. A superheater is an appliance for the purpose of increasing the temperature of steam.
              (6) Economizer. An economizer is a feed-water heater usually located in the uptake or casing of a boiler to absorb heat from the waste gases.
              (7) Domes. Domes are superstructures of shells, attached by riveting, bolting, or welding. They generally consist of a cylindrical shell with one end flanged for attachment to the main shell and the other end closed by a head which may be integral with, riveted, or welded to the shell.
              (8) Steam chimneys. Steam chimneys are superstructures of steam boilers which are fitted with a lining inside of which the products of combustion pass to the smokestack. They may be constructed in the form of a dome integral with the boiler or as independent steam vessels connected by piping to the boiler.
              (9) Furnace. A furnace is a firebox or a large flue in which the fuel is burned.
              (i) Corrugated furnace. A corrugated furnace is a cylindrical shell wherein corrugations are formed circumferentially for additional strength and to provide for expansion.
              (ii) Plain furnace. A plain furnace is a cylindrical shell usually made in sections joined by means of riveting or welding.
              (10) Combustion chamber. A combustion chamber is that part of an internally fired boiler in which combustible gases may be burned after leaving the furnace.
              (i) Separate combustion chamber. A separate combustion chamber is a combustion chamber which is connected to one furnace only.
              (ii) Common combustion chamber. A common combustion chamber is a combustion chamber connected to two or more furnaces in a boiler.
              (iii) Crown or top plate. A crown or top plate is the top of a combustion chamber and is usually supported by girder stays or by sling stays or braces.
              (iv) Curved bottom plate. A curved bottom plate is the bottom of a separate combustion chamber formed to an arc of a circle and usually designed to be self-supporting.
              (v) Combustion chamber tube sheet. A combustion chamber tube sheet is the plate forming the end of a combustion chamber in which the tubes are secured.
              (vi) Combustion chamber back sheet. A combustion chamber back sheet is the plate opposite the tube sheet forming the back of the combustion chamber. It is usually stayed to the back head of the boiler by means of screw staybolts, or, in the case of double-ended boilers, to the back of the combustion chamber of the other end of the boiler.
              (11) Flues. Flues are cylindrical shells made of seamless or welded tubing, or with a riveted longitudinal joint, the ends being attached by riveting or welding. Their purpose is to provide additional heating surface and to form a path for the products of combustion.
              (12) Tubes. Tubes are cylindrical shells of comparatively small diameter constituting the main part of the heating surface of a boiler or superheater.
              (i) Seamless tube. A seamless tube is a tube without any longitudinal joint.
              (ii) Electric-resistance-welded tube. An electric-resistance-welded tube is a tube the longitudinal joint of which is made by the electric-resistance butt welding process.
              (iii) Stay tube. A stay tube is a thickwalled tube, the end of which is usually thickened by upsetting to compensate for threading. Such tubes are used for staying tube sheets into which they are screwed and expanded.
              (13) Tube sheet. A tube sheet is a portion of a boiler drum, or header perforated for the insertion of tubes.
              (14) Ligament. The ligament is the section of metal between the holes in a tube sheet.
              (i) Longitudinal ligament. A longitudinal ligament is the minimum section of metal between two tube holes on a line parallel with the axis of the drum.
              (ii) Circumferential ligament. A circumferential ligament is the minimum section of metal between two tube holes on a line around the circumference of the drum.

              (10) (Modifies PG-73.2.) Cast iron may be used only for caps and lifting bars. When used for these parts, the elongation must be at least 5 percent in 51mm (2 inch) gage length. Nonmetallic material may be used only for gaskets and packing.
              (b)(1) (Modifies PG-68.) Superheater safety valves shall be as indicated in PG-68 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code except as noted otherwise in this paragraph.
              
              (2) The setting of the superheater safety valve shall not exceed the design pressure of the superheater outlet flange or the main steam piping beyond the superheater. To prevent damage to the superheater, the drum safety valve shall be set at a pressure not less than that of the superheater safety valve setting plus 5 pounds minimum plus approximately the normal load pressure drop through the superheater and associated piping, including the controlled desuperheater if fitted. See also § 52.01-95(b) (1).
              (3) Drum pilot actuated superheater safety valves are permitted provided the setting of the pilot valve and superheater safety valve is such that the superheater safety valve will open before the drum safety valve.
              (c)(1) (Modifies PG-71.) Safety valves shall be installed as indicated in PG-71 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code except as noted otherwise in this paragraph.
              (2) The final setting of boiler safety valves shall be checked and adjusted under steam pressure and, if possible, while the boiler is on the line and the steam is at operating temperatures, in the presence of and to the satisfaction of a marine inspector who, upon acceptance, shall seal the valves. This regulation applies to both drum and superheater safety valves of all boilers.
              (3) The safety valve body drains required by PG-71 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code shall be run as directly as possible from the body of each boiler safety valve, or the drain from each boiler safety valve may be led to an independent header common only to boiler safety valve drains. No valves of any type shall be installed in the leakoff from drains or drain headers and they shall be led to suitable locations to avoid hazard to personnel.
              (d)(1) (Modifies PG-72.) The operation of safety valves shall be as indicated in PG-72 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code except as noted in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

              § 54.01-5
              Scope (modifies U-1 and U-2).
              (a) This part contains requirements for pressure vessels. table 54.01-5(a) gives a breakdown by parts in this subchapter of the regulations governing various types of pressure vessels, boilers, and thermal units.
              (b) Pressure vessels are divided into Classes I, I-L (low temperature), II, II-L (low temperature), and III. table 54.01-5(b) describes these classes and sets out additional requirements for welded pressure vessels.
              (c) The requirements for pressure vessels by class are as follows:

              (1) Class I-L and II-L pressure vessels must meet the applicable requirements in this part.
              
              (2) Pressure vessels containing hazardous materials as defined in § 150.115 of this chapter must meet the requirements of this part or, as applicable, the requirements in 49 CFR parts 171-177 or part 64 of this chapter.
              (3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, Classes I, II, and III pressure vessels not containing hazardous materials must be designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements in Section VIII, division 1, of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1) and must be stamped with the ASME “U” symbol. These pressure vessels must also comply with the requirements that are listed or prescribed in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section. Compliance with other provisions in this part is not required.
              (4) Classes II and III pressure vessels that have a net internal volume of less than 0.14 cubic meters (5 cubic feet) and do not contain hazardous materials must be stamped with either the ASME “U” or “UM” symbol. Compliance with other provisions in this part is not required.
              (d) Pressure vessels described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section must—
              (1) Have detailed plans that include the information required by § 54.01-18 (approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 2130-0181);
              (2) Meet § 54.01-35, § 54.20-3(c), and § 54.25-3 of this part;
              (3) Have pressure relief devices required by subpart 54.15;
              (4) Meet the applicable requirements in §§ 54.10-3, 54.10-20, and 54.10-25 for inspection, reports, and stamping;
              (5) If welded, meet the post weld heat treatment and minimum joint and radiography requirement in table 54.01-5(b); and
              (6) If a steam generating pressure vessel, meet § 54.01-10.
              (e) The plans required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be certified by a registered professional engineer to meet the design requirements in paragraph (d) of this section and in section VIII, division 1, of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The certification must appear on all drawings and analyses. The plans must be made available to the Coast Guard prior to the inspection required by § 54.10-3(c).
              (f) If a pressure vessel has more than one independent chamber and the chambers have different classifications, each chamber must, as a minimum, meet the requirements for its classification. If a single classification for the entire pressure vessel is preferred, the classification selected must be one that is required to meet all of the regulations applicable to the classification that is not selected. For example, if one chamber is Class I and one chamber is Class II-L, the only single classification that can be selected is Class I-L.
              (g) The design pressure for each interface between two chambers in a multichambered pressure vessel must be—
              (1) The maximum allowable working pressure (gauge) in the chamber with the higher pressure; or
              (2) If one chamber is a vacuum chamber, the maximum allowable working pressure (absolute) in the other chamber minus the least operating pressure (absolute) in the vacuum chamber.

              (b) The pressure portions of pressure vessels shall:
              (1) Normally have a corrosion allowance of one-sixth of the calculated thickness, or one-sixteenth inch, whichever is smaller, added to the calculated thickness as determined by the applicable design formula.
              (2) Be specifically evaluated in cases where unusually corrosive cargoes will be involved, for the possible increase of this corrosion allowance.
              (3) Have no additional thickness required when acceptable corrosion resistant materials are used.
              (4) Not normally need additional thickness allowance when the effective stress (either S or SE depending on the design formula used) is 80 percent or less of the allowable stress listed in section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code for calculating thickness.
              (c) Telltale holes shall not be permitted in pressure vessels containing dangerous fluids, such as acid, poison, corrosives, etc.
              (d) Exemption from these corrosion allowance requirements will be granted by the Commandant in those cases where:
              (1) The contents of the pressure vessel is judged to be sufficiently noncorrosive; and,

              (2) Where the external surface is also protected from corrosion. A suitable vapor barrier is adequate protection, while paint or other thin coatings exposed to weather or mechanical damage are not acceptable.

              The toughness tests of materials used in pressure vessels shall be as required by this subpart in lieu of requirements in UG-84 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1)

              (a) Where material or welding toughness tests are required by §§ 54.25-10, 54.25-15, 54.25-20, and subpart 57.03 or 57.06 of this subchapter, the following requirements shall apply:
              (1) Additional requirements for ferritic steels with properties enhanced by heat treatment are in § 54.25-20.
              (2) Certified reports of toughness tests by the material manufacturer will be acceptable evidence provided the specimens taken are representative of the material delivered and that the material is not subject to treatment during or following fabrication that will reduce its impact properties. If such treatment is subsequently applied to the material, test specimens shall be so taken and treated as to be representative of the material in the finished vessel.
              (b) The requirements of this subpart are also applicable to nonpressure vessel type low temperature tanks and associated secondary barriers, as defined in § 38.05-4 of subchapter D (Tank Vessels) of this chapter.

              § 54.05-5
              Toughness test specimens.
              (a) Charpy V-notch impact tests. Where required, Charpy V-notch tests shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM Specification E 23 (incorporated by reference, see § 54.01-1), “Notched Bar Impact Testing of Metallic Materials”, using the Type A specimen shown in Figure 4 of the specification. Special attention is drawn to the fact that the Charpy Keyhole and U-notch specimens are not acceptable substitutes for the Charpy V-notch specimen and shall not be used to qualify materials within the scope of this subpart. Each set of Charpy impact tests shall consist of three specimens. For materials 1/2-inch thick or less, the largest possible Charpy specimens for that thickness shall be cut centered at the material's mid-thickness. For materials thicker than 1/2-inch, full size Charpy specimens shall be cut centered at a location as near as practicable to a point midway between the material's surface and half-thickness. Except where otherwise specified, transversely oriented specimens must be used. When longitudinal specimens are used, the required energy values may not be less than 1.5 times the values required for transversely oriented specimens. In all cases the notch shall be cut normal to the material's surface. Test specimens shall be taken at least one “t” from any heat treated edge (where “t” is the material's nominal thickness).
              (b) Drop weight tests. Where required, drop weight tests shall be conducted for no-break performance in accordance with ASTM Specification E 208 (incorporated by reference, see § 54.01-1), “Conducting Drop-Weight Test to Determine Nil-Ductility Transition Temperature of Ferritic Steels”. For material thicknesses between 1/2-inch and 5/8-inch, the ASTM E-208 specimen P-3, machined to 1/2-inch thickness, shall be used with a stop distance of 0.090-inch. In preparing weld specimens for dropweight testing, weld reinforcement shall be ground flush, the hard facing bead centered on and transverse to the weld, and the notch centered on and parallel to the weld axis.
              (c) Retest procedures. (1) When Charpy V-notch impact specimens are used and the average value of the three initial specimens fails to meet the stated requirements by an amount not exceeding 15 percent, or the value for more than one specimen is below the required average value of when the value for one specimen is below the minimum value permitted for a single specimen by an amount not exceeding 15 percent, three additional specimens from the same material may be tested and the results combined with those previously obtained to form a new average. This new average of six specimens must exceed the specified minimum average. In the event the Charpy retests fail, the material may still be qualified by exhibiting a no-break performance when tested in accordance with the drop weight procedure, if applicable. Two drop weight specimens shall be tested for each Charpy V-notch set of three initial specimens which failed to qualify. Failure of either or both of these drop weight specimens will constitute rejection of the material or weldments represented, except as outlined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
              (2) When drop weight specimens are used, retests shall be permitted only within the limits prescribed in ASTM Specification E 208 (incorporated by reference, see § 54.01-1), except as outlined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
              (3) If, for heat treated base material, the required toughness results are not obtained in the initial test or in the retest, the material may be reheat treated one time and tested again in accordance with the initial requirements for the material.
              (d) Alternate toughness tests. The Charpy V-notch impact values of §§ 54.05-20(a) and 54.05-25(a) are representative of those which correlate with the nil-ductility transition temperature determined by the drop-weight tests for the steels specified in § 54.25-10. For materials for which there are other data showing suitable correlation between Charpy V-notch and drop-weight tests, V-notch acceptance limits different from those tabulated herein may be specially approved by the Commandant, based upon the actual correlation. In the case of steels for which the tabulated Charpy V-notch values can be shown to be inapplicable or in the case of specially considered steels, or as an alternative to complying with the tabulated impact requirements, acceptance may be based upon the material exhibiting a no-break performance when tested in accordance with the drop-weight procedure. Whenever the drop-weight test is used as an alternative to the Charpy V-notch test, two drop-weight specimens shall be tested for each set of three Charpy V-notch specimens otherwise required. If the drop-weight test cannot be performed because of material thickness limitations (less than one-half inch) or product shape, or is otherwise inapplicable (because of heat treatment, chemistry, etc.), other tests and/or test criteria will be specified by the Commandant to assure the adequacy of the material for the intended application.

              Certification of material toughness tests.
              (a) Plate material. The manufacturer of plates may certify such material, provided it has been given an appropriate heat-treatment, by reporting the results of tests of one set of Charpy impact specimens or of two drop weight specimens, as applicable, taken from each plate as rolled. Impact specimens shall be taken as outlined in section 12 of ASTM A 20 (incorporated by reference, see § 54.01-1). The long axis of the Charpy specimen must be perpendicular to the final direction of rolling. When the direction of maximum stress is unknown, the manufacturer may certify on the basis of specimens taken parallel to the final direction of rolling.
              (b) Pipe or tube material. (1) The manufacturer of pipe, tube, or welded fittings formed from pipe or tube may certify such material by reporting the results of tests of one set of Charpy impact specimens, provided the requirement for production in this paragraph (b)(1) or paragraph (b)(2) of this section, as well as the requirement for sampling in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are met. The specimens shall have the major axis parallel to the length of pipe or tube. In the case of welding fittings, the specimens may be taken from the tubing prior to forming provided the fittings are normalized after forming. Such specimens shall be normalized before testing.
              (2) One set of specimens may represent each five (5) short tons, or less, of the pipe, tubes, or welding fittings produced from one heat of steel poured from a single melting furnace charge and subsequently processed in the same manner, provided all are given a normalizing heat-treatment in a continuous treating furnace in which the temperature is automatically controlled and checked by recording pyrometer.
              (3) One set of specimens may represent each five (5) short tons, or less, of the pipe, tubes, or welding fittings that have been given a normalizing heat-treatment as a single charge in a batch-treating furnace equipped with recording pyrometer provided all have been produced from a single melting furnace heat and are subsequently processed in the same manner. If more than one melting furnace heat is present in the batch heat-treating furnace, means of identification shall be provided and one set of specimens shall be taken from each heat.
              (4) One set of impact specimens shall be taken from one pipe or tube picked at random from each heat or furnace batch or portion thereof to be certified.
              (c) Forgings and forged or rolled fittings. (1) The manufacturer of forgings for any purpose may certify them by reporting the results of tests of one set of Charpy impact specimens or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable, taken from each 5 short tons of product from each melting heat provided the requirements in this paragraph for production and sampling are met.
              (2) One or more test blocks shall be cut from billets or blooms selected at random from each heat of material. Each test block shall be forge-reduced in thickness to the thickness of the finished forgings to be certified, within the limitations set below. After forging to the reduced thickness, the test block shall be heat-treated in the same manner as the finished forgings represented, which heat-treatment of test blocks may be carried out in the furnace with the forgings, or separately. If carried out separately, both heat-treatments shall be done in automatically controlled furnaces equipped with calibrated recording pyrometers, the certified records of which shall be made available to the inspector.
              (3) One set of Charpy impact specimens or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable, shall be cut from each such test block and these specimens shall represent all forgings (up to 5 short tons) that are from the same heat of material and given the same heat-treatment as the test block, and the thickness of which does not differ from that of the test block by more than plus or minus 50 percent of 11/2 inches, whichever is less, except that forged flanges and tube sheets thicker than 51/2 inches may be qualified from a 4-inch test block.
              (4) As many test blocks shall be made as are required under the foregoing rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section to cover the weight of product and range of thickness found in the forgings represented. The major axis of the test specimens shall be parallel to the length of the test block.
              (d) Bars and shapes, rolled or forged. (1) The manufacturer of forged or rolled bars and shapes may certify such by reporting the results of one set of Charpy impact specimens, or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable, produced from each 5 short tons from a single melting furnace heat, processed in a similar manner and heat-treated as a single furnace batch, if heat-treated. The impact specimens shall be cut from the heaviest section, clear of fillets, of the shape being tested with the axis of the specimens parallel to the axis of the bar or shape.
              (e) Castings. (1) The manufacturer of castings may certify them by reporting the results of one set of Charpy impact specimens or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable, taken from each 5 short tons of product from each melting furnace heat. These specimens shall be taken either directly from a production casting or from test coupons cast attached thereto provided the additional requirements in this paragraph are met.
              (2) One set of Charpy impact or two drop-weight specimens may represent all castings (up to 5 short tons) that are from the same heat of material and that have a thickness that does not differ from the thickness of the section from which the specimens were taken by more than plus or minus 25 percent, or 11/2 inches, whichever is less. A wider range of thicknesses from one heat may be covered by taking additional sets of specimens from thicker or thinner material as may be required.
              (3) The test specimens shall be heat-treated in the same manner as the castings represented, which heat-treatment of specimens may be carried out in the furnace with the castings represented, or separately, but if carried out separately both heat-treatments shall be done in automatically controlled furnaces equipped with calibrated recording pyrometers, the certified records of which shall be made available to the marine inspector.
              (f) Small parts. The manufacturer of small parts, either cast or forged, may certify a lot of not more than 20 duplicate parts or 5 short tons, whichever is less, by reporting the results of one set of Charpy impact specimens, or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable, taken from one such part selected at random, provided the same kind of material and the same process of production were used for all of the lot. When the part is too small to provide the specimens of at least minimum size, no impact test need be made. For such parts too small to impact test, toughness qualifications shall be determined by the Commandant based on material, chemical, and mechanical properties.

              (b) Plate materials for which Charpy V-notch minimums are not specified, or for which a Charpy V-notch correlation with NDT is not known, and which are themselves tested for toughness by the drop-weight procedure, shall have welding procedures similarly qualified by the drop-weight test. For such qualifications, two drop-weight specimens are to be tested, with the notch positioned directly above and parallel to the centerline of the weld.
              (c) Piping welding toughness tests shall be qualified, by making Charpy V-notch impact tests as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section.

              (d) Materials which are specially approved based on toughness criteria or tests, other than those discussed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, shall have welding procedures tested and qualified for toughness as deemed appropriate and necessary by the Commandant.
              (e) In the case of stainless steels, weld procedure toughness tests may be limited to weld metal only if this is all that is required by § 54.25-15.
            
            
              § 54.05-16
              Production toughness testing.
              (a) For vessels of welded construction, production toughness test plates shall be prepared for each 50 feet of longitudinal and circumferential butt weld in each Class I-L vessel, or for each 150 feet in each Class II-L vessel, except for material other than stainless steel that is exempted from impact test requirements by this subchapter. In the case of stainless steels, weld production toughness tests may be limited to weld metal only if this is all that is required be § 54.25-15. The test-plate thickness shall be the same as that of the vessel wall at the location of the production weld being sampled. The test plates shall be prepared, wherever possible, as run-off tabs attached at the ends of weld butts or seams. The rolling direction of the run-off tabs should be oriented parallel to the rolling direction of the adjacent production material. The test-plate material shall be taken from one of the heats of material used in the vessel, and both the electrodes and welding procedures shall be the same as used in the fabrication of the vessel. From each test plate, one set of three Charpy impact bars or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable according to the test used in procedure qualification, shall be taken transverse to the weld axis. For Charpy V-notch specimens, the notch shall be normal to the material surface and its location alternated (approximately) on successive tests between the weld metal and heat affected zone. Thus, approximately half of all weld production impact tests will be of weld metal and half of heat affected zone material. For the weld metal tests, the V-notch is to be centered between the fusion lines. For the heat affected zone tests, the notch is to be centered so as to sample, as nearly as practicable, the most critical location for toughness observed in the weld procedure qualification tests. Where the drop weight specimen is used in production weld testing, it shall be prepared in the same manner as specified for procedure qualification testing, § 54.05-15(b).
              (b) For vessels not exceeding 5 cubic feet in volume, one set of impact specimens, or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable according to the test used in procedure qualification, may represent all vessels from the same heat of material not in excess of 100 vessels, or one heat-treatment furnace batch. In addition, when such vessels are welded, one weld test plate made from one of the heats of material used, and two sets of impact specimens or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable, cut therefrom, may represent the weld metal in the smallest of: One lot of 100 vessels or less; or each heat-treatment furnace batch; or each 50 feet of welding for Class I-L vessels; or each 150 feet of welding for Class II-L vessels.
              (c) For several vessels or parts of vessels being welded in succession, the plate thickness of which does not vary by more than one-fourth inch, and which are made of the same grade of material, a test plate shall be furnished for each 50 feet of welding for Class I-L vessels or 150 feet of welding for Class II-L vessels. For each 50- or 150-foot increment of weld, as applicable, the test plates shall be prepared at the time of fabrication of the first vessel involving that increment.
              (d) The test plates and any other test material from which toughness test specimens are cut shall be given the same heat-treatment as the production material they represent. Test specimens representing other material than the weld toughness test plates shall preferably be cut from a part of the vessel material but may be cut from like material that has been heat-treated within the temperature range specified by the producer in treating the actual vessel material.

              (e) For nonpressure vessel type tanks and associated secondary barriers, as defined in § 38.05-4, subchapter D (Tank Vessels) of this chapter, production toughness test plates shall be prepared in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section. One set of toughness test plates shall be prepared for each 165 feet (50 meters) of production butt type welds.

              (1) For weld metal specimens, not less than the transverse values required for the parent material.

              § 54.10-5
              Maximum allowable working pressure (reproduces UG-98).
              (a) The maximum allowable working pressure for a vessel is the maximum pressure permissible at the top of the vessel in its normal operating position at the designated coincident temperature specified for that pressure. It is the least of the values found for maximum allowable working pressure for any of the essential parts of the vessel by the principles given in paragraph (b) of this section and adjusted for any difference in static head that may exist between the part considered and the top of the vessel. (See appendix 3 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1.)
              (b) The maximum allowable working pressure for a vessel part is the maximum internal or external pressure, including the static head hereon, as determined by the rules and formulas in section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, together with the effect of any combination of loadings listed in UG-22 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (see 46 CFR 54.01-30) that are likely to occur, or the designated coincident operating temperature, excluding any metal thickness specified as corrosion allowance. (See UG-25 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.)

              (c) Maximum allowable working pressure may be determined for more than one designated operating temperature, using for each temperature the applicable allowable stress value.

              § 54.10-10
              Standard hydrostatic test (modifies UG-99).
              (a) All pressure vessels shall satisfactorily pass the hydrostatic test prescribed by this section, except those pressure vessels noted under § 54.10-15(a).
              (b) The hydrostatic-test pressure must be at least one and three-tenths (1.30) times the maximum allowable working pressure stamped on the pressure vessel, multiplied by the ratio of the stress value “S” at the test temperature to the stress value “S” at the design temperature for the materials of which the pressure vessel is constructed. The values for “S” shall be taken from tables UCS 23, UNF 23, UHA 23, or UHT 23 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 54.01-1). The value of “S” at test temperature shall be that taken for the material of the tabulated value of temperature closest to the test temperature. The value of “S” at design temperature shall be as interpolated from the appropriate table. No ratio less than one shall be used. The stress resulting from the hydrostatic test shall not exceed 90 percent of the yield stress of the material at the test temperature. External loadings which will exist in supporting structure during the hydrostatic test should be considered. The design shall consider the combined stress during hydrostatic testing due to pressure and the support reactions. This stress shall not exceed 90 percent of the yield stress of the material at the test temperature. In addition the adequacy of the supporting structure during hydrostatic testing should be considered in the design.
              (c) The hydrostatic test pressure shall be applied for a sufficient period of time to permit a thorough examination of all joints and connections. The test shall not be conducted until the vessel and liquid are at approximately the same temperature.
              (d) Defects detected during the hydrostatic test or subsequent examination shall be completely removed and then inspected. Provided the marine inspector gives his approval, they may then be repaired.
              (e) Vessels requiring stress relieving shall be stress relieved after any welding repairs have been made. (See UW-40 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.)
              (f) After repairs have been made the vessel shall again be tested in the regular way, and if it passes the test, the marine inspector may accept it. If it does not pass the test, the marine inspector can order supplementary repairs, or, if in his judgment the vessel is not suitable for service, he may permanently reject it.

              § 54.10-15
              Pneumatic test (modifies UG-100).
              (a) Pneumatic testing of welded pressure vessels shall be permitted only for those units which are so designed and/or supported that they cannot be safely filled with water, or for those units which cannot be dried and are to be used in a service where traces of the testing medium cannot be tolerated.
              (b) Proposals to pneumatically test shall be submitted to the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, for approval.
              (c) Except for enameled vessels, for which the pneumatic test pressure shall be at least equal to, but need not exceed, the maximum allowable working pressure to be marked on the vessel, the pneumatic test pressure shall be at least equal to one and one-tenth (1.10) times the maximum allowable working pressure to be stamped on the vessel multiplied by the lowest ratio (for the materials of which the vessel is constructed) of the stress value “S” for the test temperature of the vessel to the stress value “S” for the design temperature (see UG-21 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1)). In no case shall the pneumatic test pressure exceed one and one-tenth (1.10) times the basis for calculated test pressure as defined in UA-60(e) of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.

              (d) The pneumatic test of pressure vessels shall be accomplished as follows:
              
              (1) The pressure on the vessel shall be gradually increased to not more than half the test pressure.
              (2) The pressure will then be increased at steps of approximately one-tenth the test pressure until the test pressure has been reached.
              (3) The pressure will then be reduced to the maximum allowable working pressure of the vessel to permit examination.
              (e) Pressure vessels pneumatically tested shall also be leak tested. The test shall be capable of detecting leakage consistent with the design requirements of the pressure vessel. Details of the leak test shall be submitted to the Commandant for approval.
              (f) After satisfactory completion of the pneumatic pressure test, the vessel may be stamped in accordance with § 54.10-20. A marine inspector shall observe the pressure vessel in a loaded condition at the first opportunity following the pneumatic test. The tank supports and saddles, connecting piping, and insulation if provided shall be examined to determine if they are satisfactory and that no leaks are evident.
              (g) The pneumatic test is inherently more hazardous than a hydrostatic test, and suitable precautions shall be taken to protect personnel and adjacent property.

              (b) Multichambered pressure vessels (replaces UG-116(k)). In cases where more than one pressure vessel is involved in an integral construction, as with a heat exchanger, the manufacturer may elect to class the component pressure vessels differently. In such cases he shall stamp the combined structures as required in paragraph (a) of this section with information for each pressure vessel. Where an item for stamping is identical for both vessels, as with name and address of manufacturer, it need not be duplicated. However, where differences exist, each value and the vessel to which it applies shall be clearly indicated.
              (c) Stamping data (replaces UG-117). Except as noted in paragraph (d) of this section, the data shall be stamped directly on the pressure vessel. The data shall be legibly stamped and shall not be obliterated during the service life of the pressure vessel. In the event that the portion of the pressure vessel upon which the data is stamped is to be insulated or otherwise covered, the data shall be reproduced on a metal nameplate. This plate shall be securely attached to the pressure vessel. The nameplate shall be maintained in a legible condition such that it may be easily read.

              (b) An unfired steam boiler evaporator or heat exchanger (see § 54.01-10) shall be equipped with protective devices as required by § 54.15-15.
              (c) All pressure vessels other than unfired steam boilers shall be protected by pressure-relieving devices that will prevent the pressure from rising more than 10 percent above the maximum allowable working pressure, except when the excess pressure is caused by exposure to fire or other unexpected source of heat.

              (d) Where an additional hazard can be created by exposure of a pressure vessel to fire or other unexpected sources of external heat (for example, vessels used to store liquefied flammable gases), supplemental pressure-relieving devices shall be installed to protect against excessive pressure. Such supplemental pressure-relieving devices shall be capable of preventing the pressure from rising more than 20 percent above the maximum allowable working pressure of the vessel. The minimum required relief capacities for compressed gas pressure vessels are given under § 54.15-25. A single pressure-relieving device may be used to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section, provided it meets the requirements of both paragraphs.
              (e) Pressure-relieving devices should be selected on the basis of their intended service. They shall be constructed, located, and installed so that they are readily accessible for inspection and repair and so arranged that they cannot be readily rendered inoperative.
              (f) Where pressure-indicating gages are used, they shall be chosen to be compatible with the pressure to be indicated.

In no case shall the upper range of the gage be less than 1.2 times nor more than 2 times the pressure at which the relieving device is set to function.
              (g) The Commandant may authorize or require the use of a rupture disk in lieu of a relief or safety valve under certain conditions of pressure vessel use and design. See § 54.15-13.
              (h) Vessels that are to operate completely filled with liquid shall be equipped with liquid relief valves unless otherwise protected against overpressure.
              (i) The protective devices required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be installed directly on a pressure vessel except when the source of pressure is external to the vessel, and is under such positive control that the pressure in the vessel cannot exceed the maximum allowable working pressure at the operating temperature except as permitted in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
              (j) Pressure-relieving devices shall be constructed of materials suitable for the pressure, temperature, and other conditions of the service intended.
              (k) The opening through all pipes and fittings between a pressure vessel and its pressure-relieving device shall have at least the area of the pressure-relieving device inlet, and in all cases shall have sufficient area so as not to unduly restrict the flow to the pressure-relieving device. The opening in the vessel shall be designed to provide direct and unobstructed flow between the vessel and its pressure-relieving device.
              (l) Safety devices need not be provided by the pressure vessel manufacturer. However, overpressure protection shall be provided prior to placing the vessel in service.

              § 54.15-10
              Safety and relief valves (modifies UG-126).
              (a) All safety and relief valves for use on pressure vessels or piping systems shall be designed to meet the protection and service requirements for which they are intended and shall be set to relieve at a pressure which does not exceed the “maximum allowable working pressure” of the pressure vessel or piping system. Relief valves are not required to have huddling chambers for other than steam service. In addition, safety valves used on vessels in which steam is generated shall meet § 52.01-120 of this subchapter except § 52.01-120(a)(9). For steam service below 206 kPa (30 psig), bodies of safety valves may be made of cast iron. Safety relief valves used in liquefied compressed gas service shall meet subpart 162.017 or 162.018 in subchapter Q (Specifications) of this chapter as appropriate.
              (b) Pilot-valve control or other indirect operation of safety valves is not permitted unless the design is such that the main unloading valve will open automatically at not over the set pressure and will discharge its full rated capacity if some essential part of the pilot or auxiliary device should fail. All other safety and relief valves shall be of the direct spring loaded type.
              (c) Safety and relief valves for steam or air service shall be provided with a substantial lifting device so that the disk can be lifted from its seat when the pressure in the vessel is 75 percent of that at which the valve is set to blow.

              (d) Safety and relief valves for service other than steam and air need not be provided with a lifting device although a lifting device is desirable if the vapors are such that their release will not create a hazard.
              (e) If the design of a safety or relief valve is such that liquid can collect on the discharge side of the disk, the valve shall be equipped with a drain at the lowest point where liquid can collect (for installation, see UG-134 of section VIII of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1).
              (f) Cast iron may be employed in the construction of relief valves for pressures not exceeding 125 pounds per square inch and temperatures not exceeding 450 °F. Seats or disks of cast iron are prohibited.
              (g) The spring in a relief valve in service for pressures up to and including 250 pounds per square inch shall not be reset for any pressure more than 10 percent above or 10 percent below that for which the relief valve is marked. For higher pressures, the spring shall not be reset for any pressure more than 5 percent above or 5 percent below that for which the relief valve is marked.
              (h) The rated relieving capacity of safety and relief valves for use on pressure vessels shall be based on actual flow test data and the capacity shall be certified by the manufacturer in accordance with one of the following:
              (1) 120 percent of the valve set pressure for valves rated in accordance with CGA S-1.2 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1).
              (2) 110 percent of the valve set pressure for valves rated in accordance with UG-131 of section VIII of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.
              (3) 103 percent of the valve set pressure for steam in accordance with PG-69 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.

              Rupture disks (modifies UG-127).
              (a) Paragraph UG-127 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1) provides for the use of rupture disks in series with spring loaded safety or relief valves.
              (b) For certain pressure vessels containing substances which may render a relief or safety valve inoperative, or where the installation of a valve is considered impractical, the Commandant may authorize or require the use of a rupture disk in parallel with or in lieu of a spring loaded safety or relief valve. These rupture disks shall:
              (1) Comply with the general provisions of § 54.15-5 except as noted otherwise in this section;
              (2) Have a capacity for discharge such that the volume of release is sufficient to prevent the internal pressure from exceeding 120 percent of the “maximum allowable working pressure” with the pressure vessel exposed to fire conditions (see § 54.15-25); and,
              (3) Operate at a pressure level which does not produce fatigue failure of the disk. The normal maximum operating pressure multiplied by 1.3 shall not exceed the nominal disk burst pressure. (Notice that this restriction for protection of the rupture disk will usually require operation below the “maximum allowable working pressure” of the pressure vessel and therefore should be considered in design.)
              (c) All disks shall be oriented so that if rupture occurs, the disk fragments and pressure vessel discharge will be directed away from operating personnel and vital machinery.

              (a) An approved safety valve set to relieve at a pressure not exceeding the “maximum allowable working pressure” of the shell shall be fitted to all unfired steam boilers and evaporators except for evaporators of the atmospheric type designed for vapor discharge direct to a distiller with no shutoff valve in the discharge line. The distiller connected to atmospheric evaporators shall be fitted with a vent to prevent a buildup in pressure. In no case shall the vent be less than 11/2 inches in diameter. Evaporators operating between atmospheric pressure and 15 p.s.i.g., may use a rupture disc as an alternative to the safety valve.
              
              (b) Safety valves for use on pressure vessels in which steam or pressure is generated shall comply with the requirements of § 54.15-10. Rupture discs used in lieu of these safety valves, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, shall comply with the requirements of § 54.15-13.
              (c) The relieving capacity of evaporator safety valves required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be at least equal to the capacity of the orifice fitted in the steam supply to the evaporator. The orifice capacity shall be determined in accordance with the formula in paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section as appropriate:
              (1) Where the set pressure of the evaporator shell safety valve is 58 percent or less than the setting of the safety valve in the steam supply:
              W = 51.45AP

              (2) Where the set pressure of the evaporator shell safety valve exceeds 58 percent of the setting of the safety valve on the steam supply:
              
              W = 105.3A√ P1(P−P1)

              (d) The relieving capacity of safety valves on unfired steam boilers shall not be less than the maximum generating capacity of the unfired steam boiler as certified by the manufacturer.
              (e) On new installations and where the orifice size of an existing unfired steam boiler or evaporator is increased, an accumulation test shall be made by closing all steam outlet connections except the safety valves for a period of five minutes. When conducting the accumulation test, the water shall be at the normal operating level and the steam pressure shall be at the normal operating pressure, and while under this test the pressure shall not rise more than 6 percent above the safety valve setting.
              (f) A heat exchanger with liquid in the shell and the heating medium in the tubes or coils, shall be fitted with a liquid relief valve meeting the requirement of § 54.15-5.
              (g)(1) A heat exchanger with steam in the shell and liquid in the tubes or coils at a pressure exceeding that in the shell, shall have a liquid relief valve fitted to protect the shell against excess pressure.

              (2) The discharge capacity of such relief valves shall be calculated on the basis of the discharge from one tube using the difference in pressures between that in the shell and that in the tubes and shall be not less than that determined by the following formula:

              (c-1) For an independent tank that has a portion of the tank protruding above the open deck, the fire exposure factor must be calculated for the surface area above the deck and the surface area below the deck, and this calculation must be specially approved by the U.S. Coast Guard, Office of Design and Engineering Standards (CG-ENG)..

              (d) In determining the total safety valve relieving capacity, the arrangement and location of the valves on the tank will be evaluated. The valves shall be placed so that a number of valves sufficient to provide the required relieving capacity shall always be in communication with the cargo vapor phase. The possible motions which the tank may see in its intended service and attendant changes in cargo liquid level will be considered. Shut off valves shall not be installed between the vessel and the safety relief valves. Manifolds for mounting multiple relief valves may be fitted with acceptable interlocking shut off valves so arranged that the required capacity of discharge will be “lined up” at all times.
              (e)(1) Each safety relief valve shall be tested in the presence of a marine inspector before being placed in service except as noted otherwise in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The test shall satisfactorily show that the valve will start to discharge at the required minimum pressure.
              (2) Each safety relief valve fitted with a breaking pin and rupture disk need not be tested in the presence of a marine inspector before being placed in service. In lieu thereof, a certificate shall be furnished with the valve attested to by the manufacturer that the test requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section have been met.

(1) This section contains requirements for pressure vessels and nonpressure vessel type tanks and associated secondary barrier, as defined in § 38.05-4 and § 154.7 of this chapter, and their parts constructed of carbon and alloy steels which are stressed at operating or hydrostatic test temperatures below 0 °F.

              (2) The service temperature is the minimum temperature of a product at which it may be contained, loaded and/or transported. However, the service temperature shall in no case be taken higher than given by the following formula:
              
              ts = tw−0.25(tw−tB)
              
              
                where:
                
                ts = Service temperature.
                tw = Boiling temperature of gas at normal working pressure of container but not higher than + 32 °F.
                tB = Boiling temperature of gas at atmospheric pressure.
              
              
              Only temperatures due to refrigerated service usually need to be considered in determining the service temperature, except pressure vessel type cargo tanks operating at ambient temperatures must meet paragraph (d) of this section. “Refrigerated service”, as used in this paragraph, means a service in which the temperature is controlled by the process and not by atmospheric conditions.
              (b) Specifications. Materials used in the construction of vessels to operate below 0 °F. (but not below the designated minimum service temperature) shall conform to a specification given in table UCS-23 in section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1) and the following additional requirements:

              Scope.
              (a) Certain pressure vessels may be mechanically stress relieved in accordance with the requirements in this subpart.
              (b) [Reserved]
            
            
              § 54.30-3
              Introduction.
              (a) Large conventional pressure vessels used to transport liquefied petroleum and natural gases, at “low temperatures” may often be difficult to thermally stress relieve. Where no other problem, such as corrosion exists, mechanical stress relief will be permitted for Class II-L pressure vessels.
              (b) Mechanical stress relief serves to cause small flaws, particularly in the weld zone, to yield plastically at the flaw tip resulting in a local relief of stress and a blunting of the crack tip. To achieve the maximum benefit from mechanical stress relief, it is necessary that the stresses so imposed be more severe than those expected in normal service life. At the same time, it is necessary that the stresses which are imposed are not so high as to result in appreciable deformation or general yielding.
              (c) The weld joint efficiencies as listed in table UW-12 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1) shall apply except that a minimum of spot radiography will be required. UW-12(c) of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code that permits omitting all radiography does not apply. Spot examination shall follow UW-52 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and, in addition, these vessels will be required to have radiographic examination of intersecting circumferential and longitudinal joints for a distance of at least 20 times the plate thickness from the junction. See 46 CFR 54.25-8 on spot radiography.

              (d) Severe cold forming will not be permitted unless thermal stress relief is used. For example, parts of the vessels which are individually cold formed, such as heads, must be thermally stress relieved, where the extreme fiber strain measured at the surface exceeds 5 percent as determined by:
              
              Percent strain = (65t/Rf)[1-(Rf/Ro)]
              
              
                where:
                
                t = Plate thickness.
                Rf = Final radius.
                Ro = Original radius (equals infinity for flat plate).

              § 54.30-5
              Limitations and requirements.
              (a) Class II-L pressure vessels which require stress relief (see table 54.01-5(b)) may be mechanically stress relieved provided:
              (1) The steels from which they are fabricated do not specifically require thermal stress relief in UCS-56 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1) and have a ratio of yield to ultimate tensile strength not greater than 0.8. For example: A-537 steels could be mechanically stress relieved.
              (2) Pressure difference across the shell is not greater than 100 pounds per square inch, thickness of shell is not greater than 1 inch, and the design temperature is not greater than 115 °F.
              (3) It will carry liquids of specific gravity no greater than 1.05.
              (4) Design details are sufficient to eliminate stress concentrators: Mechanical stress relief is not acceptable in designs involving the following types of welded connections shown in UW-16.1 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code:

              (i) Types l, m, n, and p because of nonintegral reinforcement. Type o will be acceptable provided the plate, nozzle, and reinforcement assembly are furnace stress relieved and the reinforcement is at least 6 inches or 10t, whichever is larger, from the plate head.
              (ii) Types d, e, and f because expansion and contraction stresses are concentrated at the junction points.
              (5) That no slip-on flanges in sizes greater than 2 inches are used.
              (6) The categories A and B joints are type one as described in table UW-12 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and all categories C and D joints are full penetration welds. See UW-3 of the ASME Code for definition of categories.
              (b) When a pressure vessel is to be mechanically stress relieved in accordance with § 54.30-10(a)(1), its maximum allowable working pressure will be 40 percent of the value which would otherwise be determined. However, an increase of this 40 percent factor may be permitted if the stress relief is carried out at a pressure higher than that required by § 54.30-10(a)(1) and an experimental strain analysis is carried out during stress relief. This evaluation should provide information as to the strains at the saddles, welded seams and nozzles as well as the body of the vessel. The hydrostatic pressure applied during stress relief should be such that, except in the case of welds, the stresses in the vessel shall closely approach but not exceed 90 percent of the yield stress of the material at the test temperature. The proposed experimental program should be submitted to the Commandant for approval prior to its use. Photo-elastic coating, strain gaging, or a brittle coating technique is suggested for the experimental analysis.

              § 54.30-10
              Method of performing mechanical stress relief.
              (a) The mechanical stress relief shall be carried out in accordance with the following stipulations using water as the pressurizing medium:
              (1) At a hydrostatic pressure (measured at the tank top) of 11/2 times the design pressure. (See UA-60(e) of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.)
              (2) At a temperature of 70 °F. or the service temperature plus 50 °F., whichever is higher. Where the ambient temperature is below 70 °F., and use of water at that temperature is not practical, the minimum temperature for mechanical stress relief may be below 70 °F. but shall not be less than 50 °F. above service temperature.
              (3) The stress relief shall be at the required temperature and pressure and held for a period not less than 2 hours per inch of metal thickness, but in no case less than 2 hours.
              (b) It is considered preferable that mechanical stress relief be accomplished with the tanks in place on their saddles or supporting structure in the barge or ship in which they will be utilized. In any case, it is considered mandatory that the tank be supported only by its regular saddles or supporting structure, without any auxiliary or temporary supports.

              § 54.30-15
              Requirement for analysis and computation.
              (a) A stress analysis shall be performed to determine if the tank may be exposed to excessive loadings during the mechanical stress relief process. This analysis should include consideration of the local stresses in way of saddles or other supporting structure and additional bending stresses due to the weight of the pressurizing liquid particularly in areas of high stress concentration. While it is necessary that the general stress level during the process be in excess of the normal working level, the calculated maximum stress during test shall not exceed 90 percent of the yield strength of the material at test temperature. The supporting structure shall be analyzed to verify its adequacy.
              (b) In all cases where the tanks are mechanically stress relieved in place in the ship or barge and the tanks are designed to carry cargoes with a specific gravity less than 1.05, the ship or barge shall be shown to have adequate stability and buoyancy, as well as strength to carry the excess weight of the tank during the stress relief procedure.

              § 56.07-5
              Definitions (modifies 100.2).
              (a) Piping. The definitions contained in 100.2 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) apply, as well as the following:
              (1) The word piping within the meaning of the regulations in this subchapter refers to fabricated pipes or tubes with flanges and fittings attached, for use in the conveyance of vapors, gases or liquids, regardless of whether the diameter is measured on the inside or the outside.
              (b) Nominal diameter. The term nominal diameter or diameter as used in this part, means the commercial diameter of the piping, i.e., pipe size.
              
              (c) Schedule. The word Schedule when used in this part refers to specific values as given in ASME B36.10M and B36.19M (both incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).
              (d) Fittings and appurtenances. The word fitting and the phrase fittings and appurtenances within the meaning of the regulations in this subchapter refer to pressure containing piping system components other than valves and pipe. This includes piping system components whose function is to join branches of the system (such as tees, wyes, elbows, unions, bushings, etc.) which are referred to as pipe joining fittings, as well as components which operate on the fluid contained in the system (such as traps, drains, strainers, separators, filters, meters, etc.), which are referred to as “fluid conditioner” fittings. Thermometer wells and other similar fittings which form part of the pressure barrier of any system are included under this heading. Expansion joints, slip joints, rotary joints, quick disconnect couplings, etc., are referred to as special purpose fittings, and may be subject to such special design and testing requirements as prescribed by the Commandant. Refer to subpart 56.15 for design requirements for fittings.
              (e) Nonstandard fittings. “Nonstandard fitting” means a component of a piping system which is not fabricated under an adopted industry standard.
              (f) Vital systems. (1) Vital systems are those systems that are vital to a vessel's survivability and safety. For the purpose of this subchapter, the following are vital systems:
              (i) Systems for fill, transfer, and service of fuel oil;
              (ii) Fire-main systems;
              (iii) Fixed gaseous fire-extinguishing systems;
              (iv) Bilge systems;
              (v) Ballast systems;

              § 56.07-10
              Design conditions and criteria (modifies 101-104.7).
              (a) Maximum allowable working pressure. (1) The maximum allowable working pressure of a piping system must not be greater than the internal design pressure defined in 104.1.2 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).
              (2) Where the maximum allowable working pressure of a system component, such as a valve or a fitting, is less than that computed for the pipe or tubing, the system pressure shall be limited to the lowest of the component maximum allowable working pressures.
              (b) Relief valves. (modifies 101.2). (1) Every system which may be exposed to pressures higher than the system's maximum allowable working pressure shall be safeguarded by appropriate relief devices. (See § 52.01-3 of this subchapter for definitions.) Relief valves are required at pump discharges except for centrifugal pumps so designed and applied that a pressure in excess of the maximum allowable working pressure for the system cannot be developed.

              (2) The relief valve setting shall not exceed the maximum allowable working pressure of the system. Its relieving capacity shall be sufficient to prevent the pressure from rising more than 20 percent above the system maximum allowable working pressure. The rated relieving capacity of safety and relief valves used in the protection of piping systems only shall be based on actual flow test data and the capacity shall be certified by the manufacturer at 120 percent of the set pressure of the valve.
              (3) Relief valves shall be certified as required in part 50 of this subchapter for valves, and shall also meet the requirements of § 54.15-10 of this subchapter.
              (c) Ship motion dynamic effects (replaces 101.5.3). Piping system designs shall account for the effects of ship motion and flexure, including weight, yaw, sway, roll, pitch, heave, and vibration.
              (d) Ratings for pressure and temperature (modifies 102.2). The material in 102.2 of ASME B31.1 applies, with the following exceptions:
              (1) The details of components not having specific ratings as described in 102.2.2 of ASME B31.1 must be furnished to the Marine Safety Center for approval.
              (1) The details of components not having specific ratings as described in 102.2.2 of ANSI B31.1 must be furnished to the Marine Safety Center for approval.
              (2) Boiler blowoff piping must be designed in accordance with § 56.50-40 of this part.
              (e) Pressure design (modifies 102.3, 104.1.2, and 104.4). (1) Materials for use in piping must be selected as described in § 56.60-1(a) of this part. Tabulated values of allowable stress for these materials must be measured as indicated in 102.3.1 of ASME B31.1 and in tables 56.60-1 and 56.60-2(a) of this part.
              (2) Allowable stress values, as found in the ASME Code, which are restricted in application by footnote or are italicized shall not be used. Where multiple stresses are listed for a material, the lowest value of the listing shall be used unless otherwise approved by the Commandant. In all cases the temperature is understood to be the actual temperature of the component.
              (3) Where the operator desires to use a material not listed, permission must be obtained from the Commandant. Requirements for testing found in § 56.97-40(a)(2) and § 56.97-40(a)(4) may affect design and should be considered. Special design limitations may be found for specific systems. Refer to subpart 56.50 for specific requirements.
              (f) Intersections (modifies 104.3). The material in 104.3 of ASME B31.1 is applicable with the following additions:
              (1) Reinforcement calculations where applicable shall be submitted.
              (2) Wherever possible the longitudinal joint of a welded pipe should not be pierced.

Each gate, globe, and angle valve must generally be of the rising-stem type, preferably with the stem threads external to the valve body. Where operating conditions will not permit such installations, the use of a nonrising-stem valve will be acceptable. Each nonrising-stem valve, lever-operated valve, or other valve where, because of design, the position of the disc or closure mechanism is not obvious must be fitted with an indicator to show whether the valve is opened or closed, except as provided for in § 56.50-1(g)(2)(iii) of this part. No such indicator is required for any valve located in a tank or similar inaccessible space when indicators are available at accessible sites. The operating levers of each quarter-turn (rotary) valve must be parallel to the fluid flow when open and perpendicular to the fluid flow when closed.

              (b) Valves of Class I piping systems (for restrictions in other classes refer to sections on low temperature service), having diameters exceeding 2 inches must have bolted, pressure seal, or breech lock bonnets and flanged or welding ends, except that socket type welding ends shall not be used where prohibited by § 56.30-5(c) of this part, § 56.30-10(b)(4) of this part for the same pressure class, or elsewhere in this part. For diameters not exceeding 2 inches, screwed union bonnet or bolted bonnet, or bonnetless valves of a type which will positively prevent the stem from screwing out of the body may be employed. Outside screw and yoke design must be used for valves 3 inches and larger for pressures above 600 pounds per square inch gage. Cast iron valves with screwed-in or screwed-over bonnets are prohibited. Union bonnet type cast iron valves must have the bonnet ring made of steel, bronze, or malleable iron.
              
              (c) Valves must be designed for the maximum pressure to which they may be subjected, but in no case shall the design pressure be less than 50 pounds per square inch gage. The use of wafer type resilient seated valves is not permitted for shell connections unless they are so arranged that the piping immediately inboard of the valve can be removed without affecting the watertight integrity of the shell connection. Refer also to § 56.20-15(b)(2)(iii) of this part. Large fabricated ballast manifold connecting lines exceeding 8 inches nominal pipe size must be designed for a pressure of not less than 25 pounds per square inch gage.
              (d) Disks or disk faces, seats, stems and other wearing parts of valves shall be made of material possessing corrosion and heat-resisting qualities suitable for the service conditions to which they may be subjected.
              (e) Plug cocks shall be constructed with satisfactory and positive means of preventing the plug from becoming loosened or removed from the body when the plug is operated. Cocks having plug locking arrangements depending on cotter pins are prohibited.
              (f) Cocks shall be marked in a straight line with the body to indicate whether they are open or closed.
              (g) Materials forming a portion of the pressure barrier shall comply with the applicable provisions of this part.

              § 56.20-15
              Valves employing resilient material.
              (a) A valve in which the closure is accomplished by resilient nonmetallic material instead of a metal to metal seat shall comply with the design, material, construction and testing for valves specified in this part.
              (b) Valves employing resilient material shall be divided into three categories, Positive shutoff, Category A, and Category B, and shall be tested and used as follows:
              (1) Positive shutoff valves. The closed valve must pass less than 10 ml/hr (0.34 fluid oz/hr) of liquid or less than 3 l/hr (0.11 cubic ft/hr) of gas per inch nominal pipe size through the line after removal of all resilient material and testing at full rated pressure. Packing material must be fire resistant. Piping subject to internal head pressure from a tank containing oil must be fitted with positive shutoff valves located at the tank in accordance with § 56.50-60(d). Otherwise positive shutoff valves may be used in any location in lieu of a required Category A or Category B valve.
              (2) Category A valves. The closed valve must pass less than the greater of 5 percent of its fully open flow rate or 15 percent divided by the square root of the nominal pipe size (NPS) of its fully open flow rate through the line after complete removal of all resilient seating material and testing at full rated pressure; as represented by the formula: (15% / SQRT × (NPS)) (Fully open flow rate). Category A valves may be used in any location except where positive shutoff valves are required by § 56.50-60(d). Category A valves are required in the following locations:
              (i) Valves at vital piping system manifolds;
              (ii) Isolation valves in cross-connects between two piping systems, at least one of which is a vital system, where failure of the valve in a fire would prevent the vital system(s) from functioning as designed.
              (iii) Valves providing closure for any opening in the shell of the vessel.
              (3) Category B valves. The closed valve will not provide effective closure of the line or will permit appreciable leakage from the valve after the resilient material is damaged or destroyed. Category B valves are not required to be tested and may be used in any location except where a Category A or positive shutoff valve is required.

              (c) If a valve designer elects to use either a calculation or actual fire testing instead of material removal and pressure testing, the calculation must employ ISA-S75.02 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) to determine the flow coefficient (Cv), or the fire testing must be conducted in accordance with API 607 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).

              § 56.30-3
              Piping joints (reproduces 110).
              The type of piping joint used shall be suitable for the design conditions and shall be selected with consideration of joint tightness, mechanical strength and the nature of the fluid handled.
            
            
              § 56.30-5
              Welded joints.
              (a) General. Welded joints may be used for materials for which welding procedures, welders, and welding machine operators have been qualified in accordance with part 57 of this subchapter.
              (b) Butt welds—general. Butt welds may be made with or without backing or insert rings within the limitations established in § 56.70-15. When the use of backing rings will result in undesirable conditions such as severe stress concentrations, corrosion or erosion, then:
              (1) The backing rings shall be removed and the inside of the joint ground smooth, or
              (2) The joint shall be welded without backing rings, or
              (3) Consumable insert rings must be used. Commonly used types of butt welding end preparations are shown in ASME B16.25 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).
              (4) Restrictions as to the use of backing rings appear for the low temperature piping systems and should be checked when designing for these systems.
              (c) Socket welds (Modifies 127.3.3A.).

              (1) Each socket weld must conform to ASME B16.11 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2), to applicable standards listed in 46 CFR 56.60-1, table 56.60-1(b), and to Figure 127.4.4C in ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) as modified by § 56.30-10(b)(4) of this part. A gap of approximately one-sixteenth inch between the end of the pipe and the bottom of the socket must be provided before welding. This may best be provided by bottoming the pipe and backing off slightly before tacking.
              
              (2) Socket welds must not be used where severe erosion or crevice corrosion is expected to occur. Restrictions on the use of socket welds appear in § 56.70-15(d)(3) of this part for Class I service and in § 56.50-105 of this part for low temperature service. These sections should be checked when designing for these systems. See § 56.70-15(d)(4) of this part for Class II service.
              (3) (Reproduces 111.3.4.) Drains and bypasses may be attached to a fitting or valve by socket welding provided the socket depth, bore diameter and shoulder thickness conform to ASME B16.11.
              (d) Fillet welds. A fillet weld may vary from convex to concave. The size of a fillet weld is determined as shown in Figure 127.4.4A of ASME B31.1. Fillet-weld details for socket-welding components must meet § 56.30-5(c). Fillet-weld details for flanges must meet § 56.30-10 of this part (see also § 56.70-15(d)(3) and (4) of this part for applications of fillet welds).
              (e) Seal welds. Seal welds may be used but shall not be considered as contributing any strength to the joint.

If 100 percent radiography is required by 46 CFR 56.95-10 for the class, diameter, wall thickness, and material of the pipe being joined, then slip-on flanges are not permitted and butt-welding flanges are required. The configuration in Figure 127.4.4B(b) of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2), using a face and backweld, may be preferable where eliminating void spaces is desirable. For systems of Class II, the size of the strength fillet may be limited to a maximum of 0.525 inch instead of 1.4T, and the distance from the face of the flange to the end of the pipe may be a maximum of three-eighths of an inch. Restrictions on the use of slip-on flanges appear in 46 CFR 56.50-105 for low-temperature piping systems.

Whenever full radiography is required by 46 CFR 56.95-10 for the class, diameter, and wall thickness of the pipe being joined, the use of socket welding flanges is not permitted and a butt weld type connection must be provided. For Class II piping, socket welding flanges may be used without diameter limitation, and the size of the fillet weld may be limited to a maximum of 0.525 inch instead of 1.4T. Restrictions on the use of socket welds appear in 46 CFR 56.50-105 for low temperature piping systems.

The flange shall be attached to the pipe as shown by Figure 56.30-10(b). Method 6. The pressure shall not exceed the American National Standard Service pressure temperature rating. The size of the strength fillet weld may be limited to a maximum of 0.525 inch instead of 1.4T and the distance from the face of the flange to the end of the pipe may be a maximum of three-eighths inch.
              (7) Figure 56.30-10 (b), Method 7. Lap joint flanges (Van Stone) may be used for Class I and Class II piping. The Van Stone equipment must be operated by competent personnel. The ends of the pipe must be heated from 1,650° to 1,900 °F. dependent on the size of the pipe prior to the flanging operation. The foregoing temperatures must be carefully adhered to in order to prevent excess scaling of the pipe. The extra thickness of metal built up in the end of the pipe during the forming operation must be machined to restore the pipe to its original diameter. The machined surface must be free from surface defects and the back of the Van Stone lap must be machined to a fine tool finish to furnish a line contact with the mating surface on the flange for the full circumference as close as possible to the fillet of the flange. The number of heats to be used in forming a flange must be determined by the size of the pipe and not more than two pushups per heat are permitted. The width of the lap flange must be at least three times the thickness of the pipe wall and the end of the pipe must be properly stress relieved after the flanging operation is completed. Manufacturers desiring to produce this type of joint must demonstrate to a marine inspector that they have the proper equipment and personnel to produce an acceptable joint.
              (8) Figure 56.30-10 (b), Method 8. Welding neck flanges may be used on any piping provided the flanges are butt-welded to the pipe. The joint must be welded as indicated by Figure 56.30-10(b), Method 8, and a backing ring employed which will permit complete penetration of the weld metal. If a backing ring is not used, refer to 46 CFR 56.30-5(b) for requirements.
              (9) Figure 56.30-10 (b), Method 9. Welding neck flanges may also be attached to pipe by a double-welded butt joint as shown by Figure 56.30-10(b), Method 9.
              (10) Figure 56.30-10 (b), Method 10. Flanges may be attached by shrinking the flange on to the end of the pipe and flaring the end of the pipe to an angle of not less than 20°. A fillet weld of the size shown by Figure 56.30-10(b), Method 10, must be used to attach the hub to the pipe. This type of flange is limited to a maximum pressure of 300 pounds per square inch at temperatures not exceeding 500 °F.
              (11) Figure 56.30-10(b), Method 11. The flange of the type described and illustrated by Figure 56.30-10(b), Method 10, except with the fillet weld omitted, may be used for Class II piping for pressures not exceeding 150 pounds per square inch and temperatures not exceeding 450 °F.
              (12) Figure 56.30-10(b), Method 12. High-hub bronze flanges may be used for temperatures not exceeding 425 °F. The hub of the flange must be bored to a depth not less than that required for a threaded connection of the same diameter leaving a shoulder for the pipe to butt against. A preinserted ring of silver brazing alloy having a melting point not less than 1,000 °F and of sufficient quantity to fill the annular clearance between the flange and the pipe must be inserted in the groove. The pipe must then be inserted in the flange and sufficient heat applied externally to melt the brazing alloy until it completely fills the clearance between the hub and the flange of the pipe. A suitable flux must be applied to the surfaces to be joined to produce a satisfactory joint.
              (13) Figure 56.30-10(b), Method 13. The type of flange as described for Figure 56.30-10(b), Method 12, may be employed and in lieu of an annular groove being machined in the hub of the flange for the preinserted ring of silver brazing alloy, a bevel may be machined on the end of the hub and the silver brazing alloy introduced from the end of the hub to attach the pipe to the flange.
              (14) Figure 56.30-10(b), Method 14. Flanges may be attached to nonferrous pipe by inserting the pipe in the flange and flanging the end of the pipe into the recess machined in the face of the flange to receive it. The width of the flange must be not less than three times the pipe wall thickness. In addition, the pipe must be securely brazed to the wall of the flange.

              Flared, flareless, and compression fittings.
              (a) This section applies to pipe fittings that are mechanically connected to pipe by such means as ferrules, flared ends, swaging, elastic strain preload, crimping, bite-type devices, and shape memory alloys. Fittings to which this section applies must be designed, constructed, tested, and marked in accordance with ASTM F 1387 (incorporated by reference, see § 56.01-2). Previously approved fittings may be retained as long as they are maintained in good condition to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.

              (c) Flared, flareless, and compression type tubing fittings may be used for tube sizes not exceeding 50 millimeters (2 inches) outside diameter within the limitations of applicable standards and specifications listed in this section and § 56.60-1 of this part.
              (d) Flareless fittings must be of a design in which the gripping member or sleeve must grip or bite into the outer surface of the tube with sufficient strength to hold the tube against pressure, but without appreciably distorting the inside tube diameter or reducing the wall thickness. The gripping member must also form a pressure seal against the fitting body.
              (e) For fluid services, other than hydraulic systems, using a combustible fluid as defined in § 30.10-15 of this chapter and for fluid services using a flammable fluid as defined in § 30.10-22 of this chapter, flared fittings must be used; except that flareless fittings of the nonbite type may be used when the tubing system is of steel, nickel copper or copper nickel alloy. When using copper or copper zinc alloy, flared fittings are required.

Brazing alloy shall either be end-fed into the socket or shall be provided in the form of a preinserted ring in a groove in the socket. The brazing alloy shall be sufficient to fill completely the annular clearance between the socket and the pipe or tube.
              (b) Limitations. (1) Brazed socket-type joints shall not be used on systems containing flammable or combustible fluids in areas where fire hazards are involved or where the service temperature exceeds 425 °F. When specifically approved by the Commandant, brazed construction may be used for service temperatures up to 525 °F. in boiler steam air heaters provided the requirements of UB-12 of section VIII ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) are satisfied at the highest temperature desired.

              (a) This section applied to pipe fittings that form a seal by compressing a resilient gasket onto the pipe joint primarily by threaded fasteners and where joint creep is only restricted by such means as machined grooves, centering pins, or welded clips. Fittings to which this section applies must be designed, constructed, tested, and marked in accordance with ASTM F 1476 (incorporated by reference, see § 56.01-2) and ASTM F 1548 (incorporated by reference, see § 56.01-2). Previously approved fittings may be retained as long as they are maintained in good condition to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.

              (1) Any location where leakage, undetected flooding or impingement of liquid on vital equipment may disable the vessel; or
              (2) In tanks where the liquid conveyed in the piping system is not chemically compatible with the liquid in the tank.
              (c) Gasketed mechanical couplings must not be used as expansion joints. Positive restraints must be included, where necessary, to prevent the coupling from creeping on the pipe and uncovering the joint. Bite-type devices do not provide positive protection against creep and are generally not accepted for this purpose. Machined grooves, centering pins, and welded clips are considered positive means of protection against creep.

              Flexible pipe couplings of the compression or slip-on type.
              (a) Flexible pipe couplings of the compression or slip-on type must not be used as expansion joints. To ensure that the maximum axial displacement (approximately 3/8″ maximum) of each coupling is not exceeded, positive restraints must be included in each installation.
              (b) Positive means must also be provided to prevent the coupling from “creeping” on the pipe and uncovering the joint. Bite type devices do not provide positive protection against creeping and are not generally accepted for this purpose unless other means are also incorporated. Machined grooves or centering pins are considered positive means, and other positive means will be considered.

              (c) Couplings which employ a solid sleeve with welded attachments on both pipes will require the removal of one set of attachments before dismantling. Rewelding of the attachments may require gas freeing of the line.
              
              (d) The installation shall be such as to preclude appreciable difference in the vibration magnitudes of the pipes joined by the couplings. The couplings shall not be used as a vibration damper. The vibration magnitude and frequency should not exceed that recommended by the coupling manufacturer.
              (e) Flexible couplings made in accordance with the applicable standards listed in table 56.60-1(b) of this part and of materials complying with subpart 56.60 of this part may be used within the material, size, pressure, and temperature limitations of those standards and within any further limitations specified in this subchapter. Flexible couplings fabricated by welding must also comply with part 57 of this chapter.
              (f) Flexible couplings must not be used in cargo holds or in any other space where leakage, undetected flooding, or impingement of liquid on vital equipment may disable the ship, or in tanks where the liquid conveyed in the piping system is not compatible with the liquid in the tank. Where flexible couplings are not allowed by this subpart, joints may be threaded, flanged and bolted, or welded.
              (g) Damaged or deteriorated gaskets shall not be reinstalled.

              General (replaces 122).
              The requirements in this subpart for piping systems apply instead of those in section 122 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2). Installation requirements applicable to all systems:
              (a) Where pipes and scuppers are carried through watertight or oiltight bulkheads, decks or tank tops, or are carried through fire control bulkheads and decks, the integrity of the structure shall be maintained. Lead or other heat sensitive materials shall not be used in piping systems which make such bulkhead or deck penetrations where the deterioration of such systems in the event of fire would impair the integrity of the bulkheads or decks. (For plastic pipe installations, see § 56.60-25(a).) Where plate insert pads are used, bolted connections shall have threads tapped into the plate to a depth of not less than the diameter of the bolt. If welded, the pipe or flange shall be welded to both sides of the plating. Openings in structure through which pipes pass shall be reinforced where necessary. Flanges shall not be bolted to bulkheads so that the plate forms a part of the joint. Metallic materials having a melting point of 1,700 °F. or less are considered heat sensitive and if used must be suitably insulated.
              (b)(1) Pipes piercing the collision bulkhead shall be fitted with screwdown valves operable from above the bulkhead deck and the valve shall be fitted inside the forepeak tank adjacent to the collision bulkhead. The pipe penetrating the collision bulkhead shall be welded to the bulkhead on both sides. On new installations or replacement in vessels of 150 gross tons and over, the valve body shall be of steel or ductile cast iron.
              (2) Passenger vessels shall not have the collision bulkhead pierced below the margin line by more than one pipe conveying liquids in the forepeak tank except that if the forepeak tank is divided to hold two different kinds of liquids, the collision bulkhead may be pierced below the margin line by two pipes, provided there is no practical alternative to the fitting of the second pipe and further provided the safety of the vessel is maintained.
              (c) Valves and cocks not forming part of a piping system are not permitted in watertight subdivision bulkheads, however, sluice valves or gates in oiltight bulkheads of tankships may be used if approved by the Marine Safety Center.
              (d) Piping shall not be run over or in the vicinity of switchboards or other electrical equipment if avoidable. When such leads are necessary, welded joints only shall be used and provision shall be made to prevent leakage from damaging the equipment.
              (e) Stuffing boxes shall not be used on deep tank bulkheads, double bottoms or in any position where they cannot be easily examined. This requirement does not apply to ore carriers operating on the Great Lakes or cargo lines of oil tankers.
              (f) Piping systems shall be installed so that under no condition will the operation of safety or relief valves be impaired.
              (g)(1) Power actuated valves in systems other than as specified in § 56.50-60 of this part may be used if approved for the system by the Marine Safety Center. All power actuated valves required in an emergency to operate the vessel's machinery, to maintain its stability, and to operate the bilge and firemain systems must have a manual means of operation.
              (2)(i) Remote valve controls that are not readily identifiable as to service must be fitted with nameplates.
              (ii) Remote valve controls must be accessible under service conditions.
              (iii) Remote valve controls, except reach rods, must be fitted with indicators that show whether the valves they control are open or closed. Valve position indicating systems must be independent of valve control systems.
              (iv) Valve reach rods must be adequately protected.

              (v) Solid reach rods must be used in tanks containing liquids, except that tank barges having plug cocks inside cargo tanks may have reach rods of extra-heavy pipe with the annular space between the lubricant tube and the pipe wall sealed with a nonsoluble to prevent penetration of the cargo.
              
              (3) Air operated remote control valves must be provided with self-indicating lines at the control boards which indicate the desired valve positions, i.e., open or closed.
              (h) Suitable drains shall be provided at low points of piping systems.
              (i) Valves and cocks shall be located so as to be easily accessible and valves or cocks attached to the shell of the vessel or to sea chests located below the floorplating shall be operable from above the floorplates.
              (j) When welded fabrication is employed, a sufficient number of detachable joints shall be provided to facilitate overhauling and maintenance of machinery and appurtenances. The joints shall be located so that adequate space is provided for welding, and the location of the welds shall be indicated on the plans.
              (k) Piping, including valves, pipe fittings and flanges, conveying vapors, gases or liquids whose temperature exceeds 150 °F., shall be suitably insulated where necessary to preclude injury to personnel.
              (l) Where pipes are run through dry cargo spaces they must be protected from mechanical injury by a suitable enclosure or other means.

              § 56.50-15
              Steam and exhaust piping.
              (a) The design pressures of the steam piping connected to the boiler drum or to the superheater inlet header shall not be less than the lowest pressure setting of any drum safety valve. The value of allowable stress for the material shall not exceed that corresponding to the saturated steam temperature at drum pressure and shall be selected as described in § 56.07-10(e).
              (b) Main superheater outlet piping systems, desuperheated piping systems, and other auxiliary superheated piping systems led directly from the boiler superheater shall be designed for a pressure not less than the pressure at which the superheater safety valve is set. In the case of a superheated safety valve which is drum pilot actuated, the design pressure of such piping systems shall not be less than the pressure setting of the actuator valve on the drum. Where it can be shown that the limitations set forth in 102.2.4 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) will not be exceeded, the design pressure of such piping systems may be reduced but shall not be less than the pressure setting of the actuator valve on the drum less the pressure drop through the superheater, including associated piping and a control desuperheater if fitted, at the normal rated operating condition. In both cases, the value of allowable stress shall be selected using a temperature not less than that of the steam at the superheater outlet at the normal rated operating conditions in accordance with § 56.07-10(e). Valves and fittings shall be selected for the above temperature and pressure from the accepted standards in 46 CFR 56.60-1, Table 56.60-1(b), using the pressure-temperature rating in the standard.
              (c) Steam stop valves in sizes exceeding 6 inches shall be fitted with bypasses for heating the line and equalizing the pressure before the valve is opened.

              (d) In multiple boiler installations each boiler's main, auxiliary and desuperheated steam lines shall be fitted with two valves, one a stop valve and one a stop check valve.
              
              (e) Main and auxiliary steam stop valves must be readily accessible, operable by one person and arranged to seat against boiler pressure.
              (f) The auxiliary steam piping of each vessel equipped with more than one boiler must be so arranged that steam for the whistle and other vital auxiliary systems, such as the electrical-generation plant, may be supplied from any power boiler.
              (g) Steam and exhaust pipes shall not be led through coal bunkers or dry cargo spaces unless approved by the Commandant.
              (h)(1) Steam piping, with the exception of the steam heating system, must not be led through passageways, accommodation spaces, or public spaces unless the arrangement is specifically approved by the Marine Safety Center.
              (2) Steam pressure in steam heating systems must not exceed 150 pounds per square inch gage, except that steam pressure for accommodation and public space heating must not exceed 45 pounds per square inch gage.
              (3) Steam lines and registers in non-accommodation and non-public spaces must be suitably located and/or shielded to minimize hazards to any personnel within the space. Where hazards in a space cannot be sufficiently minimized, the pressure in the steam line to that space must be reduced to a maximum of 45 pounds per square inch gage.
              (4) High temperature hot water for heating systems may not exceed 375 °F.
              (i) Where positive shutoff valves are fitted in the exhaust lines of machinery, and the exhaust side, including engine steam cylinders and chests, turbine casings, exhaust piping and shutoff valves, is not designed for the full inlet pressure, the exhaust side must be protected from over pressure by one of the following means:
              (1) A full flow relief valve in the exhaust side so set and of sufficient capacity to prevent the exhaust side from being accidentally or otherwise subjected to a pressure in excess of its maximum allowable pressure.
              (2) A sentinel relief valve or other warning device fitted on the exhaust side together with a back pressure trip device which will close the inlet valve prior to the exhaust side pressure exceeding the maximum allowable pressure. A device that will throttle the inlet valve, so that the exhaust side does not exceed the maximum allowable pressure, may be substituted for the back pressure trip.
              (j) Shore steam connections shall be fitted with a relief valve set at a pressure not exceeding the design pressure of the piping.
              (k) Means must be provided for draining every steam pipe in which dangerous water hammer might otherwise occur.

              § 56.50-30
              Boiler feed piping.
              (a) General requirements. (1) Steam vessels, and motor vessels fitted with steam driven electrical generators shall have at least two separate means of supplying feed water for the boilers. All feed pumps shall be fitted with the necessary connections for this purpose. The arrangement of feed pumps shall be in accordance with paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.
              (2) Feed pump supply to power boilers may utilize the group feed system or the unit feed system.
              (3) Feed discharge piping from the pump up to, but not including the required stop and stop-check valves, shall be designed for either the feed pump relief valve setting or the shutoff head of the pump if a relief valve is not fitted. (Refer to § 56.07-10(b) for specific requirements.) Feed piping from the boiler, to and including the required stop and stop-check valves (see paragraph (b) of this section), shall have a design pressure which exceeds the maximum allowable working pressure of the boiler by either 25 percent or 225 pounds per square inch whichever is less. The value of allowable stress for design purposes shall be selected as described in § 56.07-10(e) at a temperature not below that for saturated steam at the maximum allowable working pressure of the boiler.
              (4) Feed pumps for water tube boilers shall have fresh water connections only. Care shall be taken to prevent the accidental contamination of feed water from salt water or oil systems.
              (b) Feed valves. (1) Stop and stop-check valves must be fitted in the main feed line and must be attached as closely as possible to drum inlets or to the economizer inlet on boilers fitted with integral economizers.
              (2) Where the installation will not permit the feed stop valve to be attached directly to the drum inlet nozzle on boilers not fitted with economizers, a distance piece may be installed between the stop valve and the inlet nozzle.
              (3) Feed stop or stop-check valves may be located near the operating platform on boilers fitted with economizers provided the piping between the valves and the economizer, exclusive of the feed valves and the economizer inlet nozzles, is installed with a minimum of intervening flanged connections.
              (4) Auxiliary feed lines shall be fitted with stop valves and stop-check valves. Boilers not having auxiliary feed water nozzles, or where independent auxiliary feed lines are not installed, shall have the auxiliary feed line to the drum or economizer connected to the main feed line as close as possible to the main feed stop valves; and the valves in the auxiliary feed line shall be fitted as close as possible to the junction point.
              (5) Boilers fitted with economizers shall have a check valve fitted in the economizer discharge and located as close as possible to the drum fed inlet nozzle. When economizer bypasses are fitted, a stop-check valve shall be installed in lieu of the aforementioned check valve.
              (6) A sentinel valve is not required for vessels constructed after September 30, 1997, and for other vessels to which it has been shown to the satisfaction of the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection or the Coast Guard Marine Safety Center, that a sentinel valve is not necessary for the safe operation of the particular boiler.
              (c) Feed water regulators, heaters, and grease extractors. (1) Where feed water regulators, tubular feed water heaters, and grease extractors are installed, an alternate means of operation with these devices bypassed shall be provided.
              (2) Feed water regulators designed with a built-in bypass for emergency use need not be fitted with an external bypass when installed in a feed system provided with an auxiliary feed line. All feed water regulators installed in a unit feed system shall be fitted with an external bypass. Feed water regulators bypasses shall be so arranged that the regular feed valves are in operation while the bypass is in use.
              (3) A feed water regulator may be interposed between the stop and stop-check valves in the feed lines.
              (d) Group feed system. Group feed systems shall be provided with pumps and piping as follows:
              (1) Oceangoing and Great Lakes steam vessels, having a feed pump attached to the main propelling unit, shall be provided with at least one independently driven feed pump. Each of these pumps shall be used exclusively for feed purposes and shall be capable of supplying the operating boilers at their normal capacity. In addition, a second independently driven pump, capable of supplying such boilers at 75 percent of their normal capacity, shall be provided for emergency use. This second pump may be used for other purposes.
              (2) If two independently driven pumps are provided, each capable of supplying the boilers at their normal required operating capacity, and neither of which is used for other purposes, the third or emergency feed pump is not required. Where more than two independently driven feed pumps are provided, their aggregate capacity shall not be less than 200 percent of that demanded by the boilers at their required normal operating capacity.
              (3) River or harbor steam vessels shall have at least two means for feeding the boilers; one of which shall be an independently driven pump, the other may be an attached pump, an additional independently driven pump, or an injector.
              (e) Unit feed system. Unit feed systems shall be provided with pumps and piping as follows:
              (1) The unit feed system may be used on vessels having two or more boilers. When the unit feed system is employed each boiler shall have its own independently driven main feed pump capable of supplying the boiler at its normal operating capacity. In addition these shall be an auxiliary independently driven feed pump of the same capacity which can be operated in place of and in conjunction with the main feed pump. In vessels with three or more boilers, not more than two boilers may be served by any one auxiliary pump. The auxiliary pump may be so interconnected that any pump can feed any boiler.
              (2) In the unit feed system, a separate feed line shall be provided for each boiler from its pumps. A separate auxiliary feed line is not required. The discharge from each pump and the feed supply to each boiler shall be automatically controlled by the level of the water in that boiler. In addition to the automatic control, manual control shall be provided.
              (f) Feedwater. The feedwater shall be introduced into a boiler as required by § 52.01-105(b) of this subchapter.

              (a)(1) The owner or operator of a vessel must follow the requirements for blowoff piping in this section instead of the requirements in 122.1.4 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).

              (2) Where blowoff valves are connected to a common discharge from two or more boilers, a nonreturn valve shall be provided in the line from each boiler to prevent accidental blowback in the event the boiler blowoff valve is left open.
              (b) Blowoff piping external to the boiler shall be designed for not less than 125 percent of the maximum allowable working pressure of the boiler, or the maximum allowable working pressure of the boiler plus 225 pounds per square inch, whichever is less. When the required blowoff piping design pressure exceeds 100 pounds per square inch gage, the wall thickness of the piping shall not be less than Schedule 80. The value of allowable stress for design purposes shall be selected as described in § 56.07-10(e) at a temperature not below that of saturated steam at the maximum allowable working pressure of the boiler.
              (c) Boiler blowoff piping which discharges above the lightest loadline of a vessel shall be arranged so that the discharge is deflected downward.
              (d) Valves such as the globe type so designed as to form pockets in which sediment may collect shall not be used for blowoff service.

              (a) A main circulating pump and emergency means for circulating water through the main condenser shall be provided. The emergency means may consist of a connection from an independent power pump fitted between the main circulating pump and the condenser.
              (b) Independent sea suctions shall be provided for the main circulating and the emergency circulating pumps.
              (c) A cross connection between the circulating pumps in the case of multiple units will be acceptable in lieu of an independent power pump connection.
              (d) On vessels operating on lakes (including Great Lakes), bays, sounds, or rivers, where provision is made to operate noncondensing, only one circulating unit will be required.
            
            
              § 56.50-50
              Bilge and ballast piping.
              (a)(1) All vessels except unmanned barges shall be provided with a satisfactory bilge pumping plant capable of pumping from and draining any watertight compartment except for ballast, oil and water tanks which have acceptable means for filling and emptying independent of the bilge system. The bilge pumping system shall be capable of operation under all practicable conditions after a casualty whether the ship is upright or listed. For this purpose wing suctions will generally be necessary except in narrow compartments at the ends of the vessel where one suction may be sufficient. In compartments of unusual form, additional suctions may be required.
              (2) Arrangements shall be made whereby water in the compartments will drain to the suction pipes. Efficient means shall be provided for draining water from all tank tops, other watertight flats and insulated holds. Peak tanks, chain lockers and decks over peak tanks may be drained by eductors, ejectors, or hand pumps. Where piping is led through the forepeak, see § 56.50-1(b).
              (3) Where drainage from particular compartments is considered undesirable, the provisions for such drainage may be omitted, provided it can be shown by calculations that the safety of the vessel will not be impaired.
              (4) Where the vessel is to carry Class 3 flammable liquids with a flashpoint below 23 °C (74 °F), Class 6, Division 6.1, poisonous liquids, or Class 8 corrosive liquids with a flashpoint below 23 °C (74 °F) as defined in 49 CFR part 173, in enclosed cargo spaces, the bilge-pumping system must be designed to ensure against inadvertent pumping of such liquids through machinery-space piping or pumps.
              (5) For each vessel constructed on or after June 9, 1995, and on an international voyage, arrangements must be made to drain the enclosed cargo spaces on either the bulkhead deck of a passenger vessel or the freeboard deck of a cargo vessel.

              (i) If the deck edge, at the bulkhead deck of a passenger vessel or the freeboard deck of a cargo vessel, is immersed when the vessel heels 5° or less, the drainage of the enclosed cargo spaces must discharge to a space, or spaces, of adequate capacity, each of which has a high-water-level alarm and a means to discharge overboard. The number, size and arrangement of the drains must prevent unreasonable accumulation of water. The pumping arrangements must take into account the requirements for any fixed manual or automatic sprinkling system. In enclosed cargo spaces fitted with carbon-dioxide extinguishing systems, the drains must have traps or other means to prevent escape of the smothering gas. The enclosed cargo spaces must not drain to machinery spaces or other spaces where sources of ignition may be present if water may be contaminated with Class 3 flammable liquids; Class 6, Division 6.1, poisonous liquids; or Class 8 corrosive liquids with a flashpoint below 23 °C (74 °F).
              (ii) If the deck edge, at the bulkhead deck of a passenger vessel or the freeboard deck of a cargo vessel, is immersed only when the vessel heels more than 5°, the drainage of the enclosed cargo spaces may be by means of a sufficient number of scuppers discharging overboard. The installation of scuppers must comply with § 42.15-60 of this chapter.
              (b) Passenger vessels shall have provision made to prevent the compartment served by any bilge suction piping from being flooded in the event the pipe is severed or otherwise damaged by collision or grounding in any other compartment. Where the piping is located within one-fifth of the beam of the side of the vessel (measured at right angles to the centerline at the level of the deepest subdivision loadline or deepest loadline where a subdivision loadline is not assigned) or is in a ductkeel, a nonreturn valve shall be fitted to the end of the pipe in the compartment which it serves.
              (c)(1) Each bilge suction must lead from a manifold except as otherwise approved by the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center. As far as practicable, each manifold must be in, or be capable of remote operation from, the same space as the bilge pump that normally takes suction on that manifold. In either case, the manifold must be capable of being locally controlled from above the floorplates and must be easily accessible at all times. As far as practicable, each overboard-discharge valve for a bilge system must comply with the requirements governing location and accessibility for suction manifolds. Except as otherwise permitted by paragraph (c)(4) of this section for a vessel employing a common-rail bilge system, each bilge-manifold valve controlling a bilge suction from any compartment must be of the stop-check type.
              (2) Each passenger vessel on an international voyage must comply with the provisions of SOLAS II-1/21.
              (3) A common-rail bilge system may be installed as an acceptable alternative to the system required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided it satisfies all of the following criteria:
              (i) The common-rail main runs inboard at least one-fifth of the beam of the vessel.
              (ii) A stop-check valve or both a stop valve and a check valve are provided in each branch line and located inboard at least one-fifth of the beam of the vessel.
              (iii) The stop valve or the stop-check valve is power-driven, is capable of remote operation from the space where the pump is, and, regardless of the status of the power system, is capable of manual operation to both open and close the valve.
              (iv) The stop valve or the stop-check valve is accessible for both manual operation and repair under all operating conditions, and the space used for access contains no expansion joint or flexible coupling that, upon failure, would cause flooding and prevent access to the valve.
              (v) A port and a starboard suction serve each space protected unless, under the worst conditions of list and trim and with liquid remaining after pumping, the vessel's stability remains acceptable, in accordance with subchapter S of this chapter.

              (vi) For each vessel designed for the carriage of combinations of both liquid and dry bulk cargoes (O/B/O), no bilge pump or piping is located in a machinery space other than in a pump room for cargo, and no liquid and other cargoes are carried simultaneously.
              
              (vii) For each cargo vessel in Great Lakes service, each common-rail piping for the bilge and ballast system serving cargo spaces, if installed and if connected to a dedicated common-rail bilge system, must lead separately from a valved manifold located at the pump.
              (d) The internal diameter of bilge suction pipes including strainers shall be determined by formulas (1) and (2), except that the nearest commercial size not more than one-fourth inch under the required diameter may be used. Bilge suction pipes shall be suitably faired to pump inlets.

                For mobile offshore drilling units employing unusual hull forms, “B” may be modified to the average breadth rather than the maximum breadth.
              
              
                Note 6.
                For each passenger vessel constructed on or after June 9, 1995, and being on an international voyage, D must be measured to the next deck above the bulkhead deck if an enclosed cargo space on the bulkhead deck that is internally drained in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section extends the entire length of the vessel. Where the enclosed cargo space extends a lesser length, D must be taken as the sum of the molded depth (in feet) to the bulkhead deck plus lh/L where l and h are the aggregate length and height (in feet) of the enclosed cargo space.
              
              
              (3) For vessels of 150 gross tons and over, no main suction piping shall be less than 21/2 inches internal diameter. Branch piping need not be more than 4 inches and shall not be less than 2 inches in diameter except for drainage of small pockets or spaces in which case 11/2-inch diameter may be used. For vessels less than 150 gross tons no bilge suction shall be less than 11/2 inches internal diameter and no branch piping shall be less than 1 inch nominal pipe size.
              (4) For vessels of 65 feet in length or less and not engaged on an international voyage, the bilge pipe sizes computed by Formulas (1) and (2) of this paragraph are not mandatory, but in no case shall the size be less than 1 inch nominal pipe size.
              (5) The number, location, and size of bilge suctions in the boiler and machinery compartments shall be determined when the piping plans are submitted for approval and shall be based upon the size of the compartments and the drainage arrangements.
              (e) Independent bilge suction. One of the independent bilge pumps must have a suction of a diameter not less than that given by Formula (2) in paragraph (d) of this section that is led directly from the engine room bilge entirely independent of the bilge main, and on passenger vessels each independent bilge pump located in the machinery spaces must have such direct suctions from these spaces, except that not more than two pumps are required to have direct suctions from any one space. A suction that is led directly from a suitably located pump manifold may be considered to be independent of the bilge main. Where two direct suctions are required in any one compartment on passenger vessels, one suction must be located on each side of the compartment. If watertight bulkheads separate the engine and boiler rooms, a direct suction or suctions must be fitted to each compartment unless the pumps available for bilge service are distributed throughout these compartments, in which case at least one pump in each such compartment must be fitted with direct suction in its compartment. In a vessel with more than one hull, there must be one bilge pump that has an independent bilge suction in each hull. In a column stabilized mobile offshore drilling unit, the independent bilge suction must be from the pumproom bilge.
              (f) Emergency bilge suctions. In addition to the independent bilge suction(s) required by paragraph (e) of this section, an emergency bilge suction must be provided in the machinery space for all self-propelled vessels as described in the following subparagraphs. Emergency suctions must be provided from pumps other than those required by § 56.50-55(a) of this part. Such suctions must have nonreturn valves, and must meet the following criteria as appropriate:
              (1) On passenger vessels propelled by steam and operating on an international voyage or on ocean, coastwise, or Great Lakes routes, the main circulating pump is to be fitted with a direct bilge suction for the machinery space. The diameter of such suctions shall not be less than two-thirds the diameter of the main sea injection. When it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that the main circulating pump is not suitable for emergency bilge service, a direct emergency bilge suction is to be led from the largest available independent power driven pump to the drainage level of the machinery space. The suction is to be of the same diameter as the main inlet of the pump used and the capacity of the pump shall exceed that of a required main bilge pump.
              (2) On passenger vessels propelled by internal combustion engines and operating on an international voyage or on ocean, coastwise, or Great Lakes routes, the largest available pump in the engine room is to be fitted with the direct bilge suction in the machinery space except that a required bilge pump may not be used. The area of the suction pipe is to be equal to the full suction inlet of the pump. The discharge capacity of the pump selected shall exceed the capacity of the required main bilge pump.
              (3) Vessels over 180 feet in length which are not passenger vessels and which operate on international voyages or in ocean, coastwise, or Great Lakes service, must be provided with a direct emergency bilge suction from any pump in the machinery space, except that a required bilge pump may not be used. The discharge capacity of the pump selected must exceed the capacity of the required main bilge pump and the area of the suction inlet is to be equal to the full suction inlet of the pump.
              (4) Vessels under 180 feet in length need not provide an emergency bilge suction, except that passenger vessels shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (f) (1) and (2) of this section.
              (5) Each vessel with more than one hull must have an emergency bilge suction in each hull.
              (6) Each column stabilized mobile offshore drilling unit must have—
              (i) An emergency bilge suction in each hull; and
              (ii) A remote control for the emergency pump and associated valves that can be operated from the ballast control room.
              (g) Each individual bilge suction shall be fitted with a suitable bilge strainer having an open area of not less than three times at of the suction pipe. In addition a mud box or basket strainer shall be fitted in an accessible position between the bilge suction manifold and the pump.

              (h) Pipes for draining cargo holds or machinery spaces must be separate from pipes which are used for filling or emptying tanks where water or oil is carried. Bilge and ballast piping systems must be so arranged as to prevent oil or water from the sea or ballast spaces from passing into cargo holds or machinery spaces, or from passing from one compartment to another, whether from the sea, water ballast, or oil tanks, by the appropriate installation of stop and non-return valves. The bilge and ballast mains must be fitted with separate control valves at the pumps. Except as allowed by paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, piping for draining a cargo hold or machinery space must be separate from piping used for filling or emptying any tank where water or oil is carried. Piping for bilge and ballast must be arranged so as to prevent, by the appropriate installation of stop and non-return valves, oil or water from the sea or ballast spaces from passing into a cargo hold or machinery space, or from passing from one compartment to another, regardless of the source. The bilge and ballast mains must be fitted with separate control valves at the pumps.
              (i) Ballast piping shall not be installed to any hull compartment of a wood vessel. Where the carriage of liquid ballast in such vessels is necessary, suitable ballast tanks, structurally independent of the hull, shall be provided.
              (j) When dry cargo is to be carried in deep tanks, arrangement shall be made for disconnecting or blanking-off the oil and ballast lines, and the bilge suctions shall be disconnected or blanked-off when oil or ballast is carried. Blind flanges or reversible pipe fittings may be employed for this purpose.
              (k) Where bilge and ballast piping is led through tanks, except ballast piping in ballast tanks, means must be provided to minimize the risk of flooding of other spaces due to pipe failure within the tanks. In this regard, such piping may be in an oiltight or watertight pipe tunnel, or the piping may be of Schedule 80 pipe wall thickness, fitted with expansion bends, and all joints within the tanks are welded. Alternative designs may be installed as approved by the Marine Safety Center. Where a pipe tunnel is installed, the watertight integrity of the bulkheads must be maintained. No valve or fitting may be located within the tunnel if the pipe tunnel is not of sufficient size to afford easy access. These requirements need not be met provided the contents of the tank and piping system are chemically compatible and strength and stability calculations are submitted showing that crossflooding resulting from a pipe, the tank, and the spaces through which the piping passes will not seriously affect the safety of the ship, including the launching of lifeboats due to the ship's listing. Bilge lines led through tanks without a pipe tunnel must be fitted with nonreturn valves at the bilge suctions.
              (l) When bilge pumps are utilized for other services, the piping shall be so arranged that under any condition at least one pump will be available for drainage of the vessel through an overboard discharge, while the other pump(s) are being used for a different service.
              (m) All bilge pipes used in or under fuel storage tanks or in the boiler or machinery space, including spaces in which oil settling tanks or oil pumping units are located, shall be of steel or other acceptable material.

              (n) Oil pollution prevention requirements for bilge and ballast systems are contained in subpart B of part 155, title 33, Code of Federal Regulations.
              
              
                Note:
                For the purposes of this section, a pumproom is a machinery space on a column stabilized mobile offshore drilling unit.

              (d) Priming. Suitable means shall be provided for priming centrifugal pumps which are not of the self-priming type.
              (e) Location. (1) For self-propelled vessels, if the engines and boilers are in two or more watertight compartments, the bilge pumps must be distributed throughout these compartments. On other self-propelled vessels and mobile offshore drilling units, the bilge pumps must be in separate compartments to the extent practicable. When the location of bilge pumps in separate watertight compartments is not practicable, alternative arrangements may be submitted for consideration by the Marine Safety Center.

              (2) For nonself-propelled vessels requiring two bilge pumps, these pumps, insofar as practicable, shall be located in separate watertight machinery spaces. When the location of bilge pumps in separate watertight compartments is not possible, the Commandant will consider alternate arrangements of the bilge pumps.
              (3) The emergency bilge pumps shall not be installed in a passenger ship forward of the collision bulkhead.
              (4) Each hull of a vessel with more than one hull must have at least two means for pumping the bilges in each hull. No multi-hulled vessel may operate unless one of these means is available to pump each bilge.
              (f) Other pumps. Sanitary, ballast, and general service pumps having the required capacity may be accepted as independent power bilge pumps if fitted with the necessary connections to the bilge pumping system.

              (1) Each drain from a heating coil as well as each drain from an oil heater must run to an open inspection tank or other suitable oil detector before returning to the feed system.
              (2) As far as practicable, no part of the fuel-oil system containing heated oil under pressure exceeding 180 KPa (26 psi) may be placed in a concealed position so that defects and leakage cannot be readily observed. Each machinery space containing a part of the system must be adequately illuminated.

              (c) Filling pipes may be led directly from the deck into the tanks or to a manifold in an accessible location permanently marked to indicate the tanks to which they are connected. A shutoff valve must be fitted at each filling end. Oil piping must not be led through accommodation spaces, except that low pressure fill piping not normally used at sea may pass through accommodation spaces if it is of steel construction, all welded, and not concealed.
              (d) Piping subject to internal head pressure from oil in the tank must be fitted with positive shutoff valves located at the tank.
              (1) Valves installed on the outside of the oil tanks must be made of steel, ductile cast iron ASTM A 395 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2), or a ductile nonferrous alloy having a melting point above 1,700 °F and must be arranged with a means of manual control locally at the valve and remotely from a readily accessible and safe location outside of the compartment in which the valves are located.
              (i) In the special case of a deep tank in any shaft tunnel, piping tunnel, or similar space, one or more valves must be fitted on the tank, but control in the event of fire may be effected by means of an additional valve on the piping outside the tunnel or similar space. Any such additional valve installed inside a machinery space must be capable of being operated from outside this space.
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (2) If valves are installed on the inside of the tank, they may be made of cast iron and arranged for remote control only. Additional valves for local control must be located in the space where the system exits from the tank or adjacent tanks. Valves for local control outside the tanks must be made of steel, ductile cast iron ASTM A 395 , or a ductile nonferrous alloy having a melting point above 1,700 °F.
              (3) Power operated valves installed to comply with the requirements of this section must meet the following requirements:
              (i) Valve actuators must be capable of closing the valves under all conditions, except during physical interruption of the power system (e.g., cable breakage or tube rupture). Fluid power actuated valves, other than those opened against spring pressure, must be provided with an energy storage system which is protected, as far as practicable, from fire and collision. The storage system must be used for no other purpose and must have sufficient capacity to cycle all connected valves from the initial valve position to the opposite position and return. The cross connection of this system to an alternate power supply will be given special consideration by the Marine Safety Center.
              (ii) The valve shall have a local power actuator to both open and close the valve unless local manual opening operation will not prevent remote closing of the valve.
              (iii) The positioning of the valve by either the local or remote actuators shall not void the ability of the other actuator to close the valve.
              (iv) The valve shall be provided with a means of emergency manual operation to both open and close the valve regardless of the status of the power operating system. Such manual operation may interfere with the power operation, and if so, shall be protected from causal use by means of covers, locking devices, or other suitable means. Instructions and warnings regarding the emergency system shall be conspicuously posted at the valve.
              (4) Remote operation for shutoff valves on small independent oil tanks will be specially considered in each case where the size of tanks and their location may warrant the omission of remote operating rods.
              (e) Fuel oil tanks overhanging boilers are prohibited.
              (f) Valves for drawing fuel or draining water from fuel are not permitted in fuel oil systems except that a single valve may be permitted in the case of diesel driven machinery if suitably located within the machinery space away from any potential source of ignition. Such a valve shall be fitted with a cap or a plug to prevent leakage.
              (g) Test cocks must not be fitted to fuel oil or cargo oil tanks.

              (i) Where flooding equalizing cross-connections between fuel or cargo tanks are required for stability considerations, the arrangement must be approved by the Marine Safety Center.

              (j) Piping conveying oil must be run well away from hot surfaces wherever possible. Where such leads are unavoidable, only welded joints are to be used, or alternatively, suitable shields are to be fitted in the way of flanged or mechanical pipe joints when welded joints are not practicable. Piping that conveys fuel oil or lubricating oil to equipment and is in the proximity of equipment or lines having an open flame or having parts operating above 500 °F must be of seamless steel. (See § 56.50-65 of this part.)
              (k) Oil piping drains, strainers and other equipment subject to normal oil leakage must be fitted with drip pans or other means to prevent oil draining into the bilge.
              (l) Where oil piping passes through a non-oil tank without stop valves complying with paragraph (d) of this section installed at all tank penetrations, the piping must comply with § 56.50-50(k).
              (m) Each arrangement for the storage, distribution, and use of oil in a pressure-lubrication system must—
              (1) As well as comply with § 56.50-80, be such as to ensure the safety of the vessel and all persons aboard; and
              (2) In a machinery space, meet the applicable requirements of §§ 56.50-60 (b)(2) and (d), 56.50-85(a)(11), 56.50-90 (c) and (d), and 58.01-55(f) of this subchapter. No arrangement need comply with § 56.50-90 (c)(1) and (c)(3) of this subchapter if the sounding pipe is fitted with an effective means of closure, such as a threaded cap or plug or other means acceptable to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. The use of flexible piping or hose is permitted in accordance with the applicable requirements of §§ 56.35-10, 56.35-15, and 56.60-25(c).
              (n) Each arrangement for the storage, distribution, and use of any other flammable oil employed under pressure in a power transmission-system, control and activating system, or heating system must be such as to ensure the safety of the vessel and all persons aboard by—
              (1) Complying with subpart 58.30 of this subchapter; and,
              (2) Where means of ignition are present, meeting the applicable requirements of §§ 56.50-85(a)(11), 56.50-90 (c) and (d), and 58.01-55(f) of this subchapter. Each pipe and its valves and fittings must be of steel or other approved material, except that the use of flexible piping or hose is permitted in accordance with the applicable requirements of §§ 56.35-10, 56.35-15, and 56.60-25(c).

Where the size and design of an engine is such that lubrication before starting is not necessary and an attached pump is normally used, the independent auxiliary pump is not required if a duplicate of the attached pump is carried as spare. In meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section in the case of internal combustion engines, two separate means are to be provided for circulating coolant on those engines on which oil coolers are fitted. One of those means must be independently driven and may consist of a connection from a pump of adequate size normally used for other purposes utilizing the required coolant. Where the design of an engine will not readily accommodate an independent pump connection, the independent auxiliary pump will not be required if a duplicate of the attached pump is carried as a spare. Oil filters shall be provided on all internal combustion engine installations. On main propulsion engines which are fitted with full-flow type filters, the arrangement shall be such that the filters may be cleaned without interrupting the oil supply except that such an arrangement is not required on vessels having more than a single main propulsion engine.
              (e) The lubricating oil piping shall be independent of other piping systems and shall be provided with necessary coolers, heaters, filters, etc., for proper operation. Oil heaters shall be fitted with bypasses.
              (f) Diesel engine lubrication systems shall be so arranged that vapors from the sump tank may not be discharged back into the engine crank case of engines of the dry sump type.

              (i) The vents are arranged to prevent overflow on machinery, electrical equipment, and hot surfaces;
              (ii) Tanks containing combustible liquids are not heated; and
              (iii) The vents terminate above the deep load waterline if the tanks have boundaries in common with the hull.
              (5) Vents from oil tanks must terminate not less than three feet from any opening into living quarters.
              (6) Vents extending above the freeboard deck or superstructure deck from fuel oil and other tanks must be at least Schedule 40 in wall thickness. Except for barges in inland service and for Great Lakes vessels, the height from the deck to any point where water may gain access through the vent to below deck must be at least 30 inches (760mm) on the freeboard deck and 171/2 inches (450mm) on the superstructure deck. On Great Lakes vessels, the height from the deck to any point where water may gain access through the vent to below deck must be at least 30 inches (760mm) on the freeboard deck, 24 inches (610mm) on the raised quarterdeck, and 12 inches (305mm) on other superstructure decks. Where the height of vents on Great Lakes vessels may interfere with the working of the vessel, a lower height may be approved by the Marine Safety Center provided the vent cap is properly protected from mechanical damage. For barges in inland service, the vents must extend at least six inches above the deck. A lesser amount may be approved by the Marine Safety Center if evidence is provided that a particular vent has proven satisfactory in service.
              (7) Satisfactory means, permanently attached, shall be provided for closing the openings of all vents, except that barges in inland service may be exempted. Acceptable means of closure are:
              (i) A ball check valve where the ball float, normally in the open position, will float up and close under the action of a submerging wave. The valve shall be designed so that the effective clear discharge area through the valve with the float in the open position is not less than the inlet area of the vent pipe to which the valve is connected.
              (ii) A hinged closure normally open on the outlet of the return bend, which must close automatically by the force of a submerging wave; or
              (iii) Another suitable device acceptable to the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center.

              (8) Vent outlets from all tanks which may emit flammable or combustible vapors, such as bilge slop tanks and contaminated drain tanks, must be fitted with a single screen of corrosion-resistant wire of at least 30 by 30 mesh, or two screens of at least 20 by 20 mesh spaced not less than one-half inch (13mm) nor more than 11/2 inches (38mm) apart. The clear area through the mesh must not be less than the internal unobstructed area of the required pipe.
              (9) Where vents are provided with flame screens, the closure device shall be situated so as not to damage these screens.
              (10) The diameter of each vent pipe must not be less than 11/2 inches nominal pipe size for fresh water tanks, 2 inches nominal pipe size for water ballast tanks, and 21/2 inches nominal pipe size for fuel oil tanks, except that small independent tanks need not have a vent more than 25% greater in cross-sectional area than the fill line.
              (11)(i) If a tank may be filled by a pressure head exceeding that for which the tank is designed, the aggregate cross-sectional area of the vents in each tank must be not less than the cross-sectional area of the filling line unless the tank is protected by overflows, in which case the aggregate cross-sectional area of the overflows must be not less than the cross-sectional area of the filling line.
              (ii) Provision must be made to guard against liquids rising in the venting system to a height that would exceed the design head of a cargo tank or fuel-oil tank. It may be made by high-level alarms or overflow-control systems or other, equivalent means, together with gauging devices and procedures for filling cargo tanks.
              (12) Where deep tanks are intended for the occasional carriage of dry or liquid cargo, a “spectacle” or ring and blank flange may be fitted in the overflow pipe so arranged as not to interfere with venting when the tanks contain oil.
              (13) Vents from fresh water or water ballast tanks shall not be connected to a common header with vents from oil or oily ballast tanks.
              (b) Tank vents must remain within the watertight subdivision boundaries in which the tanks they vent are located. Where the structural configuration of a vessel makes meeting this requirement impracticable, the Marine Safety Center may permit a tank vent to penetrate a watertight subdivision bulkhead. All tank vents which penetrate watertight subdivision bulkheads must terminate above the weather deck.

              § 56.50-90
              Sounding devices.
              (a) Each tank must be provided with a suitable means of determining liquid level. Except for a main cargo tank on a tank vessel, each integral hull tank and compartment, unless at all times accessible while the vessel is operating, must be fitted with a sounding pipe.
              (b) Where sounding pipes terminate below the freeboard deck on cargo vessels, they shall be fitted with gate valves. On passenger vessels, where sounding pipes terminate below the bulkhead deck, they shall be fitted with self-closing gate valves.
              (c) Except as allowed by this paragraph, on each vessel constructed on or after June 9, 1995, no sounding pipe used in a fuel-oil tank may terminate in any space where the risk of ignition of spillage from the pipe might arise. None may terminate in a space for passengers or crew. When practicable, none may terminate in a machinery space. When the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center, determines it impracticable to avoid terminating a pipe in a machinery space, a sounding pipe may terminate in a machinery space if all the following requirements are met:
              (1) In addition to the sounding pipe, the fuel-oil tank has an oil-level gauge complying with paragraph (d) of this section.
              (2) The pipe terminates in a place remote from ignition hazards unless precautions are taken such as fitting an effective screen (shield) to prevent the fuel oil, in case of spillage through the end of the pipe, from coming into contact with a source of ignition.

              (3) The end of the pipe is fitted with a self-closing blanking device and a small-diameter, self-closing control cock located below the blanking device for the purpose of ascertaining before the blanking device is opened that no fuel oil is present. Provision must be made to ensure that no spillage of fuel oil through the control cock involves an ignition hazard.
              
              (d) On each vessel constructed on or after June 9, 1995, other oil-level gauges may be used instead of sounding pipes if all the following requirements are met:
              (1) In a passenger vessel, no such gauge may require penetration below the top of the tank, and neither the failure of a gauge nor an overfilling of the tank may permit release of fuel into the space.
              (2) In a cargo vessel, neither the failure of such a gauge nor an overfilling of the tank may permit release of fuel into the space. The use of cylindrical gauge-glasses is prohibited. The use of oil-level gauges with flat glasses and self-closing valves between the gauges and fuel tanks is acceptable.
              (e) The upper ends of sounding pipes terminating at the weather deck shall be closed by a screw cap or plug. Great Lakes dry cargo carriers may have the sounding pipes which service ballast water tanks terminate at least 4 inches above the deck if closure is provided by a tight fitting hinged cover making metal-to-metal contact with the hinge on the forward side. Positive means to secure these caps in the closed position shall be provided. Provision shall be made to prevent damage to the vessels' plating by the striking of the sounding rod.
              (f) On mobile offshore drilling units where installation of sounding pipes may not be practicable for some tanks, alternate means of determining liquid level may be used if approved by the Commandant.

              § 56.50-95
              Overboard discharges and shell connections.
              (a)(1) All inlets and discharges led through the vessel's side shall be fitted with efficient and accessible means, located as close to the hull penetrations as is practicable, for preventing the accidental admission of water into the vessel either through such pipes or in the event of fracture of such pipes.
              (2) The number of scuppers, sanitary discharges, tank overflows, and other similar openings in the vessel's side shall be reduced to a minimum, either by making each discharge serve for as many as possible of the sanitary and other pipes, or in any other satisfactory manner.
              (3) In general, when the bulkhead deck is above the freeboard deck, the requirements of this section apply relative to the bulkhead deck. For vessels not assigned load lines, such as certain inland vessels and barges, the weather deck shall be taken as the freeboard deck.
              (b)(1) Scuppers and discharge pipes originating at any level and penetrating the shell either more than 171/2 inches (450mm) below the freeboard deck or less than 231/2 inches (600mm) above the summer load waterline must be provided with an automatic nonreturn valve at the shell. This valve, unless required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, may be omitted if the piping is not less than Schedule 80 in wall thickness for nominal pipe sizes through 8 inches, Schedule 60 for nominal pipe sizes above 8 inches and below 16 inches, and Schedule 40 for nominal pipe sizes 16 inches and above.

              (2) Discharges led through the shell originating either from spaces below the freeboard deck or from within enclosed superstructures and equivalent deckhouses on the freeboard deck as defined in § 42.13-15(i) of subchapter E (Load Lines) of this chapter, shall be fitted with efficient and accessible means for preventing water from passing inboard. Normally each separate discharge shall have one automatic nonreturn valve with a positive means of closing it from a position above the freeboard deck. Where, however, the vertical upward distance from the summer load line to the inboard end of the discharge pipe through which flooding can take place exceed 0.01L, the discharge may have two automatic nonreturn valves without positive means of closing, provided that the inboard valve is always accessible for examination under service conditions. Where that vertical distance exceeds 0.02L a single automatic nonreturn valve without positive means of closing is acceptable. In an installation where the two automatic nonreturn valves are used, the inboard valve must be above the tropical load line. The means for operating the positive action valve shall be readily accessible and provided with an indicator showing whether the valve is open or closed. A suitable arrangement shall be made to insure the valve is not closed by unauthorized persons, and a notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place at the operating station to the effect that the valve shall not be closed except as required in an emergency.
              (3) Where scuppers and drains are installed in superstructures or deckhouses not enclosed as defined in § 42.13-15(j) of subchapter E (Load Lines) of this chapter, they shall be led overboard. Refer to paragraph (b)(1) of this section for any nonreturn valve requirement.
              (4) Sanitary pump discharges leading directly overboard or via a holding tank must meet the standards prescribed by this paragraph. The location of the sanitary system openings within the vessel determines whether the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section are applicable.
              (c) Overflow pipes which discharge through the vessel's side must be located as far above the deepest load line as practicable and fitted with valves as required by paragraph (b) of this section. Two automatic nonreturn valves must be used unless it is impracticable to locate the inboard valve in an accessible position, in which case a nonreturn valve with a positive means of closure from a position above the freeboard deck will be acceptable. Overflows which extend at least 30 inches above the freeboard deck before discharging overboard may be fitted with a single automatic nonreturn valve at the vessel's side. Overflow pipes which serve as tank vents must not be fitted with positive means of closure without the specific approval of the Marine Safety Center. Overflow pipes may be vented to the weather.
              (d)(1) Sea inlets and discharges, such as used in closed systems required for the operation of main and auxiliary machinery, as in pump connections or scoop injection heat exchanger connections, need not meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section but instead shall be fitted with a shutoff valve located as near the shell plating as practicable, and may be locally controlled if the valve is located in a manned machinery space. These controls shall be readily accessible above the floor plates and shall be provided with indication showing whether the valve is opened or closed. Manned machinery spaces include the main machinery space and are either attended by the crew or are automated in accordance with part 62 of this subchapter to be comparable to an attended space.
              (2) In unmanned machinery spaces, all machinery inlets and discharges as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be remotely operable from a position above the freeboard deck unless otherwise approved and shall meet the access and marking requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (e)(1) Pipes terminating at the shell plating shall be fitted with bends or elbows between the outboard openings and the first rigid connection inboard. In no case shall such pipes be fitted in a direct line between the shell opening and the first inboard connection.
              (2) Seachests and other hull fittings shall be of substantial construction and as short as possible. They shall be located as to minimize the possibility of being blocked or obstructed.
              (3) The thickness of inlet and discharge connections outboard of the shutoff valves, and exclusive of seachests, must be not less than that of Schedule 80 for nominal pipe sizes through 8 inches, Schedule 60 for nominal pipe sizes above 8 inches and below 16 inches, and Schedule 40 for nominal pipe sizes 16 inches and above.

              (f) Valves required by this section and piping system components outboard of such required valves on new vessel installations or replacements in vessels of 150 gross tons and over shall be of a steel, bronze, or ductile cast iron specification listed in Table 56.60-1(a). Lead or other heat sensitive materials having a melting point of 1,700 °F. or less shall not be used in such service, or in any other application where the deterioration of the piping system in the event of fire would give rise to danger of flooding. Brittle materials such as cast iron shall not be used in such service. Where nonmetallic materials are used in a piping system, and shell closures are required by this section, a positive closure metallic valve is required (see also § 56.60-25).
              (g) The inboard openings of ash and rubbish-chute discharges shall be fitted with efficient covers. If the inboard opening is located below the freeboard deck, the cover shall be watertight, and in addition, an automatic nonreturn valve shall be fitted in the chute in any easily accessible position above the deepest load line. Means shall be provided for securing both the cover and the valve when the chute is not in use. When ash-ejectors or similar expelling devices located in the boilerroom have the inboard openings below the deepest load line, they shall be fitted with efficient means for preventing the accidental admission of water. The thickness of pipe for ash ejector discharge shall be not less than Schedule 80.
              (h) Where deck drains, soil lines, and sanitary drains discharge through the shell in way of cargo tanks on tank vessels, the valves required by this section shall be located outside the cargo tanks. These valves shall meet the material requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. The piping led through such tanks shall be fitted with expansion bends where required, and shall be of steel pipe having a wall thickness of not less than five-eighths inch, except that the use of suitable corrosion-resistant material of lesser thickness will be given special consideration by the Commandant. All pipe joints within the tanks shall be welded. Soil lines and sanitary drains which pass through cargo tanks shall be provided with nonreturn valves with positive means of closing or other suitable means for preventing the entrance of gases into living quarters.
              (i) Except as provided for in § 58.20-20(c) of this chapter, sea valves must not be held open with locks. Where it is necessary to hold a discharge or intake closed with a lock, either a locking valve may be located inboard of the sea valve, or the design must be such that there is sufficient freedom of motion to fully close the locked sea valve after an event, such as fire damage to the seat, causes significant leakage through the valve. Valves which must be opened in and emergency, such as bilge discharges or fire pump suctions must not be locked closed, whether they are sea valves or not.

              (i) The cooler structure is fabricated from material of the same thickness and quality as the hull plating to which it is attached except that in the case of half round pipe lesser thickness may be used if specifically approved by the Commandant. In any case the structure, with the exception of the hull proper, need not exceed three-eighths inch in thickness.
              (ii) The flexible connections and all openings internal to the vessel, such as expansion tank vents and fills, in the installation are above the deepest load line and all piping components are Schedule 80 or thicker below the deepest load line.
              (iii) Full penetration welds are employed in the fabrication of the structure and its attachment to the hull.
              (iv) The forward end of the structure must be faired to the hull such that the horizontal length of the fairing is no less than four times the height of the structure, or be in a protected location such as inside a bow thruster trunk.

Similarly, aluminum alloys and other nonferrous materials not covered in Table 56.50-105 of this part may be specifically approved by the Marine Safety Center for service at any low temperature. There are restrictions on the use of certain materials in this part and in subchapter O of this chapter.
              (2) Piping weldments. Piping weldments shall be fabricated to satisfy the requirements of § 57.03-1(b) of this subchapter in addition to subpart 56.70. Toughness testing of production weldments for low temperature piping systems and assemblies is not required.
              (3) Postweld heat treatment. All piping weldments shall be postweld heat treated for stress relief in accordance with the procedures of subpart 56.85. The only exceptions to this requirement are for materials which do not require postweld heat treatment as shown in Table 56.85-10. Relief from postweld heat treatment shall not be dependent upon pipe thickness or weld joint type.
              (4) Nonacceptable joints. Single welded butt joints with backing ring left in place, socket welds, slip-on flanges, pipe joining sleeves, and threaded joints shall not be used, except in small diameter instrument lines.
              (5) Other requirements. All other requirements of this part for Class I piping apply to Class I-L piping. Pressure testing must comply with subpart 56.97 of this part, and nondestructive testing of circumferentially welded joints must comply with § 56.95-10. Seamless tubular products must be used except that, when the service pressure does not exceed 1724 KPa (250 psi), the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center, may give special consideration to appropriate grades of piping and tubing that are welded without the addition of filler metal in the root pass. Each production procedure and quality-control program for welded products must be acceptable to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.
              (b) Class II-L. Piping systems designed to operate at temperatures below 0 °F. and pressures not higher than 150 pounds per square inch gage shall be of Class II-L. Exceptions to this rule may be found in the individual requirements for specific commodities in subchapter D (Tank Vessels) and I (Cargo and Miscellaneous Vessels) of this chapter. The following requirements for Class II-L piping systems shall be satisfied:
              (1) Materials must be the same as those required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section except that pipe and tubing of appropriate grades welded without the addition of a filler metal may be used. The Commandant may give special consideration to tubular products welded with the addition of filler metal.
              (2) Piping weldments shall be fabricated to satisfy the requirements of § 57.03-1(b) of this subchapter in addition to subpart 56.70. Toughness testing of production weldments for low temperature piping systems and assemblies is not required.

              (3) All piping weldments shall be postweld heat treated for stress relief in accordance with the procedures of subpart 56.85. The only exceptions to this requirement are for materials which do not require postweld heat treatment as shown in Table 56.85-10 and for socket weld joints and slip-on flange weld attachments where the weld thickness does not exceed that exempted by this table. Otherwise, relief from post-weld heat treatment shall not be dependent upon pipe thickness or weld joint type.
              (4) Socket welds in nominal sizes above 3 inches, slip-on flanges in nominal sizes above 4 inches, and threaded joints in sizes above 1 inch shall not be used.
              (5) Pressure testing must comply with subpart 56.97, and nondestructive testing of welded joints must comply with § 56.95-10.
              (6) All other requirements contained in this part for Class II piping shall be applicable to Class II-L systems, except that § 56.70-15(b)(3)(iv) shall not apply.

The first column lists acceptable standards from ASTM (all incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2); the second lists those from ASME (all incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2). The Coast Guard will consider use of alternative pipes, tubing, and fittings when it receives certification of their mechanical properties. Without this certification it will restrict use of such alternatives to piping-systems inside heat exchangers that ensure containment of the material inside pressure shells.

              (6) The fire-test procedures of ISO 15540 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) are an acceptable alternative to those procedures of SAE J1942. All other tests of SAE J1942 are still required.
              (c) Plastic valves, fittings, and flanges may be used in systems employing plastic pipe. Such valves, fittings, and flanges must be designed, fabricated, tested, and installed so as to satisfy the intent of the requirements for plastic pipe contained in this section.
              (d) If it is desired to use nonmetallic materials other than those specified in this section, a request furnishing the chemical and physical properties of the material must be submitted to the Commandant for consideration.

              (b) Backing rings. When metallic backing rings are used they shall be made from material of weldable quality compatible with the base metal, whether subsequently removed or not. When nonmetallic backing rings are used they shall be of material which does not deleteriously affect either base or weld metal, and shall be removed after welding is completed. Backing rings may be of the consumable insert type, removable ceramic type, of solid or split band type. A ferrous backing ring which becomes a permanent part of the weld shall not exceed 0.05 percent sulphur. If two abutting surfaces are to be welded to a third member used as a backing ring and one or two of the three members are ferritic and the other member or members are austenitic, the satisfactory use of such materials shall be determined by procedure qualifications.

              § 56.70-10
              Preparation (modifies 127.3).
              (a) Butt welds (reproduces 127.3)—(1) End preparation. (i) Oxygen or arc cutting is acceptable only if the cut is reasonably smooth and true, and all slag is cleaned from the flame cut surfaces. Discoloration which may remain on the flame cut surface is not considered to be detrimental oxidation.
              (ii) Butt-welding end preparation dimensions contained in ASME B16.25 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) or any other end preparation that meets the procedure qualification requirements are acceptable.
              (iii) If piping component ends are bored, such boring shall not result in the finished wall thickness after welding being less than the minimum design thickness. Where necessary, weld metal of the appropriate analysis may be deposited on the inside or outside of the piping component to provide sufficient material for machining to insure satisfactory fitting of rings.
              (iv) If the piping component ends are upset they may be bored to allow for a completely recessed backing ring, provided the remaining net thickness of the finished ends is not less than the minimum design thickness.
              (2) Cleaning. Surfaces for welding shall be clean and shall be free from paint, oil, rust, scale, or other material which is detrimental to welding.
              (3) Alignment. The inside diameters of piping components to be joined must be aligned as accurately as practicable within existing commercial tolerances on diameters, wall thicknesses, and out of roundness. Alignment must be preserved during welding. Where ends are to be joined and the internal misalignment exceeds 1/16-inch, it is preferred that the component with the wall extending internally be internally trimmed (see Fig. 127.3) so that adjoining internal surfaces are approximately flush. However, this trimming must not reduce a piping component wall thickness below the minimum design thickness and the change in the contour may not exceed 30°.
              (4) Spacing. The root opening of the joint shall be as given in the procedure specification.
              (b) Fillet welds (modifies 127.4.4). In making fillet welds, the weld metal must be deposited in such a way as to obtain adequate penetration into the base metal at the root of the weld. Piping components that are to be joined utilizing fillet welds must be prepared in accordance with applicable provisions and requirements of this section. For typical details, see Figures 127.4.4A and 127.4.4C of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) and 46 CFR 56.30-10(b). See 46 CFR 56.30-5(d) for additional requirements.

              § 56.70-15
              Procedure.
              (a) General. (1) Qualification of the welding procedures to be used, and of the performance of welders and operators, is required, and shall comply with the requirements of part 57 of this subchapter.
              (2) No welding shall be done if there is direct impingement of rain, snow, sleet, or high wind on the piping component weldment.
              (3) Sections of pipe shall be welded insofar as possible in the fabricating shop. Prior to welding Class I piping or low temperature piping, the fabricator shall request a marine inspector to visit his plant to examine his fabricating equipment and to witness the qualification tests required by part 57 of this subchapter. One test specimen shall be prepared for each process and welding position to be employed in the fabrication.
              (b) Girth butt welds. (1) Girth butt welds must be complete penetration welds and may be made with a single vee, double vee, or other suitable type of groove, with or without backing rings or consumable inserts.
              (2) Girth butt welds in Class I, I-L, and II-L piping systems shall be double welded butt joints or equivalent single welded butt joints for pipe diameters exceeding three-fourth inch nominal pipe size. The use of a single welded butt joint employing a backing ring (note restrictions in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section) on the inside of the pipe is an acceptable equivalent for Class I and Class II-L applications, but not permitted for Class I-L applications. Single welded butt joints employing either an inert gas for first pass backup or a consumable insert ring may be considered the equivalent of a double welded butt joint for all classes of piping and is preferable for Class I-L and II-L systems where double butt welds cannot be used. Appropriate welding procedure qualification tests shall be conducted as specified in part 57 of this subchapter. A first pass inert gas backup is intended to mean that the inside of the pipe is purged with inert gas and that the root is welded with the inert gas metal arc (mig) or inert gas tungsten arc (tig) processes. Classes I, I-L, and II-L piping are required to have the inside of the pipe machined for good fit up if the misalignment exceeds that specified in § 56.70-10(a)(3). In the case of Class II piping the machining of the inside of the pipe may be omitted. For single welded joints, where possible, the inside of the joint shall be examined visually to assure full penetration. Radiographic examination of at least 20 percent of single welded joints to check for penetration is required for all Class I and Class I-L systems regardless of size following the requirements of § 56.95-10. Ultrasonic testing may be utilized in lieu of radiographic examination if the procedures are approved.
              (3) For Class II piping, the type of joints shall be similar to Class I piping, with the following exceptions:
              (i) Single-welded butt joints may be employed without the use of backing rings in all sizes provided that the weld is chipped or ground flush on the root side of the weld.
              (ii) For services such as vents, overflows, and gravity drains, the backing ring may be eliminated and the root of the weld need not be ground.

              (iii) Square-groove welds without edge preparation may be employed for butt joints in vents, overflows, and gravity drains where the pipe wall thickness does not exceed three-sixteenth inch.
              (iv) The crimped or forged backing ring with continuous projection around the outside of the ring is acceptable only for Class II piping. The projection must be completely fused.
              (4) Tack welds which become part of the finished weld, shall be made by a qualified welder. Tack welds made by an unqualified welder shall be removed. Tack welds which are not removed shall be made with an electrode which is the same as or equivalent to the electrode to be used for the first pass. Their stopping and starting ends must be properly prepared by grinding or other suitable means so that they may be satisfactorily incorporated into the final weld. Tack welds which have cracked shall be removed.
              (5) When components of different outside diameters are welded together, the weld joint must be filled to the outside surface of the component having the larger diameter. There must be a gradual transition, not exceeding a slope of 1:3, in the weld between the two surfaces. To avoid unnecessary weld deposit, the outside surface of the component having the larger diameter must be tapered at an angle not to exceed 30 degrees with the axis of the pipe. (See Fig. 127.4.2 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).)
              (6) As-welded surfaces are permitted; however, the surface of the welds must be sufficiently free from coarse ripple, grooves, overlaps, abrupt ridges and valleys to meet the following:
              (i) The surface condition of the finished welds must be suitable for the proper interpretation of radiographic and other nondestructive examinations when nondestructive examinations are required by § 56.95-10. In those cases where there is a question regarding the surface condition on the interpretation of a radiographic film, the film must be compared to the actual weld surface for interpretation and determination of acceptability.
              (ii) Reinforcements are permitted in accordance with Table 56.70-15.
              (iii) Undercuts must not exceed 1/32-inch and must not encroach on the minimum required section thickness.
              (iv) If the surface of the weld requires grinding to meet the above criteria, care must be taken to avoid reducing the weld or base material below the minimum required thickness.
              (7) The type and extent of examination required for girth butt welds is specified in § 56.95-10.
              (8) Sections of welds that are shown by radiography or other examination to have any of the following type of imperfections shall be judged unacceptable and shall be repaired as provided in paragraph (f) of this section:
              (i) Any type of crack or zone of incomplete fusion or penetration.
              (ii) Any slag inclusion or porosity greater in extent than those specified as acceptable set forth in PW-51 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).
              (iii) Undercuts in the external surfaces of butt welds which are more than 1/32-inch deep.
              (iv) Concavity on the root side of full penetration girth butt welds where the resulting weld thickness is less than the minimum pipe wall thickness required by this subchapter. Weld reinforcement up to a maximum of 1/32-inch thickness may be considered as pipe wall thickness in such cases.
              (c) Longitudinal butt welds. Longitudinal butt welds in piping components not made in accordance with the standards and specifications listed in 56.60-1 (a) and (b) must meet the requirements of paragraph 104.7 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) and may be examined nondestructively by an acceptable method. Imperfections shall not exceed the limits established for girth butt welds except that no undercutting shall be permitted in longitudinal butt welds. See also § 56.60-2(b).
              (d) Fillet welds. (1) Fillet welds may vary from convex to concave. The size of a fillet weld is determined as shown in Figure 127.4.4A in ASME B31.1. Fillet weld details for socket-welding components must meet § 56.30-5(c) of this part. Fillet weld details for flanges must meet § 56.30-10(c) of this part. Fillet weld details for flanges must meet § 56.30-10 of this part.

              (2) The limitations on cracks and undercutting set forth in paragraph (b)(8) of this section for girth welds are also applicable to fillet welds.
              (3) Class I piping not exceeding 3 inches nominal pipe size and not subject to full radiography by § 56.95-10 of this part may be joined by sleeves fitted over pipe ends or by socket type joints. Where full radiography is required, only butt type joints may be used. The inside diameter of the sleeve must not exceed the outside diameter of the pipe or tube by more than 0.080 inch. Fit between socket and pipe must conform to applicable standards for socket weld fittings. Depth of insertion of pipe or tube within the socket or sleeve must not be less than three-eighths inch. The fillet weld must be deposited in a minimum of two passes, unless specifically approved otherwise in a special procedure qualification. Requirements for joints employing socket weld and slip-on flanges are in § 56.30-10 of this part.
              (4) Sleeve and socket type joints may be used in Class II piping systems without restriction as to size of pipe or tubing joined. Applicable standards must be followed on fit. The fillet welds must be deposited in a minimum of two passes, unless specifically approved otherwise in a special procedure qualification. Requirements for joints employing socket weld and slip-on flanges are in § 56.30-10 of this part.
              (e) Seal welds (reproduces 127.4.5). (1) Where seal welding of threaded joints is performed, threads shall be entirely covered by the seal weld. Seal welding shall be done by qualified welders.
              (2) The limitation on cracks and undercutting set forth in § 56.70-15(b)(8) for girth welds are also applicable to seal welds.
              (f) Weld defect repairs. (1) All defects in welds requiring repair must be removed by a flame or arc-gouging, grinding, chipping, or machining. Repair welds must be made in accordance with the same procedures used for original welds, or by another welding process if it is a part of a qualified procedure, recognizing that the cavity to be repaired may differ in contour and dimensions from the original joint. The types, extent, and method of examination and limits of imperfections of repair welds shall be the same as for the original weld.
              (2) Preheating may be required for flame-gouging or arc-gouging certain alloy materials of the air hardening type in order to prevent surface checking or cracking adjacent to the flame or arc-gouged surface.
              (g) Welded branch connections. (1) Figure 127.4.8A, Figure 127.4.8B, and Figure 127.4.8C of ASME B31.1 show typical details of branch connections with and without added reinforcement. However, no attempt has been made to show all acceptable types of construction and the fact that a certain type of construction is illustrated does not indicate that it is recommended over other types not illustrated. See also Figure 56.70-15(g) for additional pipe connections.
              (2) Figure 127.4.8D of ASME B31.1 shows basic types of weld attachments used in the fabrication of branch connections. The location and minimum size of these attachment welds shall conform to the requirements of this paragraph. Weld sizes shall be calculated in accordance with 104.3.1 of ASME B31.1, but shall not be less than the sizes shown in Figure 127.4.8D and F of ASME B31.1.
              (3) The notations and symbols used in this paragraph and in Figure 127.4.8D and F of ASME B31.1 are as follows:

              (4) Branch connections (including specially made, integrally reinforced branch connection fittings) that abut the outside surface of the run wall, or that are inserted through an opening cut in the run wall, shall have opening and branch contour to provide a good fit and shall be attached by means of full penetration groove welds except as otherwise permitted in paragraph (g)(7) of this section. The full penetration groove welds shall be finished with cover fillet welds having a minimum throat dimension not less than 2tc. The limitation as to imperfection of these groove welds shall be as set forth in 127.4.2(C) of ASME B31.1 for girth welds.
              (5) In branch connections having reinforcement pads or saddles, the reinforcement shall be attached by welds at the outer edge and at the branch periphery as follows:

              (i) If the weld joining the added reinforcement to the branch is a full penetration groove weld, it shall be finished with a cover fillet weld having a minimum throat dimension not less than tc the weld at the outer edge, joining the added reinforcement to the run, shall be a fillet weld with a minimum throat dimension of 0.5 te.

              (ii) If the weld joining the added reinforcement to the branch is a fillet weld, the throat dimension shall not be less than 0.7 tmin. The weld at the outer edge joining the outer reinforcement to the run shall also be a fillet weld with a minimum throat dimension of 0.5 te.
              (6) When rings or saddles are used, a vent hole shall be provided (at the side and not at the crotch) in the ring or saddle to reveal leakage in the weld between branch and main run and to provide venting during welding and heat treating operations. Rings or saddles may be made in more than one piece if the joints between the pieces have strength equivalent to ring or saddle parent metal and if each piece is provided with a vent hole. A good fit shall be provided between reinforcing rings or saddles and the parts to which they are attached.
              (7) Branch connections 2 in. NPS and smaller that do not require reinforcement may be constructed as shown in Fig. 127.4.8F of ASME B31.1. This construction is limited to use in Class I and II piping systems at a maximum design temperature of 750 °F. or a maximum pressure of 1025 psi.
              (h) Heat treatment. Heat treatment for welds shall be in accordance with subpart 56.85.

              (a) Silver brazing. (1) Circumferential pipe joints may be either of the socket or butt type. When butt joints are employed the edges to be joined shall be cut or machined square and the edges shall be held closely together to insure a satisfactory joint.
              (b) Copper-alloy brazing. (1) Copper-alloy brazing may be employed to join pipe, valves, and fittings. Circumferential joints may be either of the butt or socket type. Where butt joints are employed, the included angle shall be not less than 90° where the wall thickness is three-sixteenths of an inch or greater. The annular clearance of socket joints shall be held to small clearances which experience indicates is satisfactory for the brazing alloy to be employed, method of heating, and material to be joined. The annular clearance shall be shown on drawings submitted for approval of socket joints.
              (2) Copper pipe fabricated with longitudinal joints for pressures not exceeding that permitted by the regulations in this subchapter may have butt, lapped, or scarfed joints. If of the latter type, the kerf of the material shall be not less than 60°.
              (c) Brazing, general. (1) Heat shall be applied evenly and uniformly to all parts of the joint in order to prevent local overheating.
              (2) The members to be joined shall be held firmly in place until the brazing alloy has set so as to prevent any strain on the joint until the brazing alloy has thoroughly solidified. The brazing shall be done by placing the flux and brazing material on one side of the joint and applying heat until the brazing material flows entirely through the lap and shows uniformly along the seam on the other side of the joint. Sufficient flux shall be used to cause the brazing material to appear promptly after reaching the brazing temperature.

              Bending.

              Pipe may be bent by any hot or cold method and to any radius which will result in a bend surface free of cracks, as determined by a method of inspection specified in the design, and substantially free of buckles. Such bends shall meet the design requirements of 102.4.5 and 104.2.1 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2). This shall not prohibit the use of bends designed as creased or corrugated. If doubt exists as to the wall thickness being adequate, Class I piping having diameters exceeding 4 inches shall be nondestructively examined by the use of ultrasonics or other acceptable method. Alternatively, the pipe may be drilled, gaged, and fitted with a screwed plug extending outside the pipe covering. The nondestructive method shall be employed where the design temperature exceeds 750 °F. Prior to the use of nondestructive method of examination by the above procedure, it shall be demonstrated by the user, in the presence of a marine inspector on specimens similar to those to be examined, that consistent results, having an accuracy of plus or minus 3 percent, can be obtained.

                (9) Heating rate for furnace, gas, electric resistance, and other surface heating methods must not exceed: (i) 600 °F per hour for thicknesses 2 inches and under.
                (ii) 600 °F per hour divided by 1/2 the thickness in inches for thickness over 2 inches.
                (10) Heating route for induction heating must not exceed:
                (i) 600 °F per hour for thickness less than 11/2 inches (60 and 400 cycles).
                (ii) 500 °F per hour when using 60 cycles and 400 °F per hour when using 400 cycles for thicknesses 11/2 inches and over.
                (11) When local heating is used, the weld must be allowed to cool slowly from the postheat treatment temperature. A suggested method of retarding cooling is to wrap the weld with asbestos and allow to cool in still air. When furnace cooling is used, the pipe sections must be cooled in the furnace to 1000 °F and may then be cooled further in still air.
                (12) Local postheat treatment of butt welded joints must be performed on a circumferential band of the pipe. The minimum width of this band, centered on the weld, must be the width of the weld plus 2 inches.

                Local postheat treatment of welded branch connections must be performed by heating a circumferential band of the pipe to which the branch is welded. The width of the heated band must extend at least 1 inch beyond the weld joining the branch.
                (13) 0.30 C. max applies to specified ladle analysis.
                (14) 600 °F maximum interpass temperature.
                (15) Welding on P-3, P-4, and P-5 with 3 Cr max. may be interrupted only if—
                (i) At least 3/8 inch thickness of weld is deposited or 25 percent of welding groove is filled, whichever is greater;
                (ii) The weld is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature; and
                (iii) The required preheat is resumed before welding is continued.
                (16) When attaching welding carbon steel non-pressure parts to steel pressure parts and the throat thickness of the fillet or partial or full penetration weld is 1/2 in. or less, postheat treatment of the fillet weld is not required for Class I and II piping if preheat to a minimum temperature of 175 °F is applied when the thickness of the pressure part exceeds 3/4 in.
                (17) For Class I-L and II-L piping systems, relief from postweld heat treatment may not be dependent upon wall thickness. See also §§ 56.50-105(a)(3) and 56.50-105(b)(3) of this chapter.

              § 56.85-15
              Postheat treatment.
              (a) Where pressure retaining components having different thicknesses are welded together as is often the case when making branch connections, the preheat and postheat treatment requirements of Table 56.85-10 apply to the thicker of the components being joined. Postweld heat treatment is required for Classes I, I-L, II-L, and systems. It is not required for Class II piping. Refer to § 56.50-105(a)(3) for exceptions in Classes I-L and II-L systems and to paragraph (b) of this section for Class I systems.
              (b) All buttwelded joints in Class I piping shall be postweld heated as required by Table 56.85-10. The following exceptions are permitted:
              (1) High pressure salt water piping systems used in tank cleaning operations; and,
              (2) Gas supply piping of carbon or carbon molybdenum steel used in gas turbines.
              (c) All complicated connections including manifolds shall be stress-relieved in a furnace as a whole as required by Table 56.85-10 before being taken aboard ship for installation.
              (d) The postheating treatment selected for parts of an assembly must not adversely affect other components. Heating a fabricated assembly as a complete unit is usually desirable; however, the size or shape of the unit or the adverse effect of a desired treatment on one or more components where dissimilar materials are involved may dictate alternative procedures. For example, it may be heated as a section of the assembly before the attachment of others or local circumferential-band heating of welded joints in accordance with 46 CFR 56.85-10, Table 56.85-10 Note (12) and 46 CFR 56.85-15(j)(3).
              (e) Postheating treatment of welded joints between dissimilar metals having different postheating requirements must be established in the qualified welding procedure.
              (f)-(h) [Reserved]
              (i) For those materials listed under P-1, when the wall thickness of the thicker of the two abutting ends, after their preparation, is less than three-fourths inch, the weld needs no postheating treatment. In all cases, where the nominal wall thickness is three-fourths inch or less, postheating treatment is not required.
              (j) (1)-(2) [Reserved]
              (3) In local postheat treatment the entire band must be brought up to uniform specified temperature over the complete circumference of the pipe section, with a gradual diminishing of the temperature outward from the edges of the band.

              § 56.95-5
              Rights of access of marine inspectors.
              Marine inspectors shall have rights of access to any place where work concerned with the piping is being performed. This includes manufacture, fabrication, assembly, erection, and testing of the piping or system components. Marine inspectors shall have access to review all certifications or records pertaining to the inspection requirements of § 56.95-1, including certified qualifications for welders, welding operators, and welding procedures.
            
            
              § 56.95-10
              Type and extent of examination required.
              (a) General. The types and extent of nondestructive examinations required for piping must be in accordance with this section and Table 136.4 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2). In addition, a visual examination shall be made.
              (1) 100 percent radiography 1 is required for all Class I, I-L, and II-L piping with wall thickness equal to or greater than 10 mm (.375 in.).
              (2) Nondestructive examination is required for all Class II piping equal to or greater than 18 inches nominal diameter regardless of wall thickness. Any test method acceptable to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection may be used.
              (3) Appropriate nondestructive examinations of other piping systems are required only when deemed necessary by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. In such cases a method of testing satisfactory to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection must be selected from those described in this section.
              (b) Visual examination. Visual examination consists of observation by the marine inspector of whatever portions of a component or weld are exposed to such observation, either before, during, or after manufacture, fabrication, assembly or test. All welds, pipe and piping components shall be capable of complying with the limitations on imperfections specified in the product specification under which the pipe or component was purchased, or with the limitations on imperfections specified in § 56.70-15(b) (7) and (8), and (c), as applicable.
              (c) Nondestructive types of examinations—(1) 100 Percent radiography. Where 100 percent radiography 1
                 is required for welds in piping, each weld in the piping shall be completely radiographed. If a butt weld is examined by radiography, for either random or 100 percent radiography, the method used shall be as follows:
              
                
                  1 Where for some reason, such as joint configuration, radiography is not applicable, another approved examination may be utilized.
              
              (i) X-ray or gamma ray method of radiography may be used. The selection of the method shall be dependent upon its adaptability to the work being radiographed. The procedure to be followed shall be as indicated in PW-51 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).
              (ii) If a piping component or a weld other than a butt weld is radiographed, the method used shall be in accordance with UW-51 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).
              (2) Random radiography. Where random radiography 1 is required, one or more welds may be completely or partially radiographed. Random radiography is considered to be a desirable means of spot checking welder performance, particularly in field welding where conditions such as position, ambient temperatures, and cleanliness are not as readily controlled as in shop welding. It is to be employed whenever an Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection questions a pipe weld not otherwise required to be tested. The standards of acceptance are the same as for 100 percent radiography.
              (3) Ultrasonic. Where 100 percent ultrasonic testing is specified, the entire surface of the weld being inspected shall be covered using extreme care and careful methods to be sure that a true representation of the actual conditions is obtained. The procedures to be used shall be submitted to the Commandant for approval.
              (4) Liquid penetrant. Where liquid penetrant examination is required, the entire surface of the weld being examined shall be covered. The examination shall be performed in accordance with appendix VIII to section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The following standards of acceptance shall be met:
              (i) All linear discontinuities and aligned penetrant indications revealed by the test shall be removed. Aligned penetrant indications are those in which the average of the center-to-center distances between any one indication and the two adjacent indications in any straight line is less than three-sixteenths inch. All other discontinuities revealed on the surface need not be removed unless the discontinuities are also revealed by radiography, in which case the pertinent radiographic specification shall apply.
              (5) Magnetic particle. Where magnetic particle testing is required, the entire surface of the weld being examined shall be covered. The testing shall be performed in accordance with appendix VI to section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The following standards of acceptance are required for welds. All linear discontinuities and aligned indications revealed by the test shall be removed. Aligned indications are those in which the average of the center-to-center distances between any one indication and the two adjacent indications in any straight line is less than three-sixteenths inch. All other revealed discontinuities need not be removed unless the discontinuities are also revealed by radiography, in which case the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be met.

              § 56.97-1
              General (replaces 137).
              (a) Scope. The requirements in this subpart apply to pressure tests of piping in lieu of 137 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2). Those paragraphs reproduced are so noted.
              (b) Leak tightness. It is mandatory that the design, fabrication and erection of piping constructed under the regulations in this subchapter demonstrate leak tightness. Except where otherwise permitted in this subpart, this requirement must be met by a hydrostatic leak test prior to initial operations. Where a hydrostatic test is not practicable, a pneumatic test (§ 56.97-35) or initial service leak test (§ 56.97-38) may be substituted if approved by the Commandant.
              (1) At no time during the hydrostatic test may any part of the piping system be subjected to a stress greater than 90 percent of its yield strength (0.2 percent offset) at test temperature.
              (2) Pneumatic tests may be used in lieu of the required hydrostatic test (except as permitted in paragraph (b)(3) of this section), only when—
              (i) Piping subassemblies or systems are so designed or supported that they cannot be safely filled with water; 1
                 or
              
                
                  1 These tests may be made with the item being tested partially filled with water, if desired.
              
              (ii) Piping subassemblies or systems are to be used in services where traces of the testing medium cannot be tolerated and, whenever possible, the piping subassemblies or system have been previously hydrostatically tested to the pressure required in § 56.97-30(e).

              (3) A pneumatic test at a pressure not to exceed 25 psig may be applied before a hydrostatic or a pneumatic test as a means of locating major leaks. The preliminary pneumatic test must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of § 56.97-35.
              
              
                Note:
                Compressed gas is hazardous when used as a testing medium. It is, therefore, recommended that special precautions for protection of personnel be taken whenever gas under pressure is used as the test medium.
              
              
              (4) The hydrostatic test of the piping system, when conducted in accordance with the requirements of this part, is acceptable as the test for piping subassemblies and may also be used in lieu of any such test required by the material specification for material used in the piping subassembly or system provided the minimum test pressure required for the piping system is met, except where the installation would prevent performing any nondestructive examination required by the material specification to be performed subsequent to the hydrostatic or pneumatic test.

              (a) Exposure of joints. All joints including welds must be left uninsulated and exposed for examination during the test.
              (b) Addition of temporary supports. Piping systems designed for vapor or gas may be provided with additional temporary supports, if necessary, to support the weight of the test liquid.
              (c) Restraint or isolation of expansion joints. Expansion joints must be provided with temporary restraint, if required for the additional pressure load under test, or they must be isolated from the test.
              (d) Isolation of equipment not subjected to pressure test. Equipment that is not to be subjected to the pressure test must be either disconnected from the piping subassembly or system or isolated by a blank flange or similar means. Valves may be used if the valve with its closure is suitable for the proposed test pressure.
              (e) Treatment of flanged joints containing blinds. Flanged joints at which blinds are inserted to blank off other equipment during the test need not be tested.
              (f) Precautions against test medium expansion. If a pressure test is to be maintained for a period of time and the test medium in the system is subject to thermal expansion, precautions must be taken to avoid excessive pressure. A small relief valve set to 11/3 times the test pressure is recommended during the pressure test.

              Hydrostatic tests (modifies 137.4).
              (a) Provision of air vents at high points. Vents must be provided at all high points of the piping subassembly or system in the position in which the test is to be conducted to purge air pockets while the component or system is filling.
              (b) Test medium and test temperature. (1) Water will be used for a hydrostatic leak test unless another medium is approved by the Commandant.
              (2) The temperature of the test medium will be that of the available source unless otherwise approved by the Commandant upon review of the metallurgical aspects of the piping materials with respect to its brittle fracture properties.
              (c) Check of test equipment before applying pressure. The test equipment must be examined before pressure is applied to ensure that it is tight and that all low-pressure filling lines and other items that should not be subjected to the test pressure have been disconnected or isolated by valves or other suitable means.
              (d) Examination for leakage after application of pressure. Following the application of the hydrostatic test pressure for a minimum of 10 minutes (see § 56.97-30(g)), examination for leakage must be made of all joints, connections and of all regions of high stress, such as regions around openings and thickness-transition sections.
              (e) Minimum required hydrostatic test pressure. Except as otherwise permitted in § 56.97-30(f) or § 56.97-40, piping systems must be subjected to a hydrostatic test pressure that at every point in the system is not less than 1.5 times the maximum allowable working pressure.
              (f) Maximum permissible hydrostatic test pressure. (1) When a system is tested hydrostatically, the test pressure must not exceed the maximum test pressure of any component such as vessels, pumps, or valves in the system.
              (2) At no time during the hydrostatic test may any part of the piping system be subjected to a stress greater than 90 percent of its yield strength (0.2 percent offset) at test temperature.
              (g) Hydrostatic test pressure holding time. The hydrostatic test pressure must be maintained for a minimum total time of 10 minutes and for such additional time as may be necessary to conduct the examination for leakage required by § 56.97-30(d).

              (d) Procedure for applying pressure. The pressure in the system must gradually be increased to not more than one-half of the test pressure, after which the pressure is increased in steps of approximately one-tenth of the test pressure until the required test pressure has been reached.
              (e) Examination for leakage after application of pressure. Following the application of pressure for the time specified in § 56.97-35(h), examination for leakage in accordance with 56.97-30(d) must be conducted.
              (f) Minimum required pneumatic test pressure. Except as provided in § 56.97-35(g) or § 56.97-40, the pneumatic test pressure may not be less than 1.20 nor more than 1.25 times the maximum allowable working pressure of the piping subassembly system.
              (g) Maximum permissible pneumatic test pressure. When a system is tested pneumatically, the test pressure may not exceed the maximum test pressure of any component such as vessels, pumps or valves in the system.
              (h) Pneumatic test pressure holding time. The pneumatic test pressure must be maintained for a minimum total time of 10 minutes and for such additional time as may be necessary to conduct the examination for leakage required in § 56.97-30(d).

              § 56.97-38
              Initial service leak test (reproduces 137.7).
              (a) An initial service leak test and inspection is acceptable when other types of test are not practical or when leak tightness is conveniently demonstrable due to the nature of the service. One example is turbine extraction piping where shut-off valves are not available for isolating a line and where temporary closures are impractical. Others may be systems for service water, low pressure condensate, plant and instrument air, etc., where checking out of pumps and compressors afford ample opportunity for leak tightness inspection prior to fullscale operation.
              (b) The piping system must be gradually brought up to design pressure. After inspection of the piping system has proven that the installation is complete and all joints are leak-tight, the piping has met the requirements of § 56.97-1.

              Installation tests.
              (a) The following piping systems shall be hydrostatically leak tested in the presence of a marine inspector at a pressure of 11/2 times the maximum allowable working pressure of the system:
              (1) Class I steam, feedwater, and blowoff piping. Where piping is attached to boilers by welding without practical means of blanking off for testing, the piping shall be subjected to the same hydrostatic pressure to which the boiler is tested. The maximum allowable working pressures of boiler feedwater and blowoff piping shall be the design pressures specified in §§ 56.50-30(a)(3) and 56.50-40(b), respectively.
              (2) Fuel oil discharge piping between the pumps and the burners, but not less than 500 pounds per square inch.
              (3) High-pressure piping for tank cleaning operations.
              (4) Flammable or corrosive liquids and compressed gas cargo piping, but not less than 150 pounds per square inch.
              (5) Any Class I, I-L, II-L piping.
              (6) Cargo oil piping.
              (7) Firemains, but not less than 150 pounds per square inch.
              (8) Fuel oil transfer and filling piping.
              (9) Class I compressed air piping.
              (10) Fixed oxygen-acetylene system piping.
              (b) Installation testing requirements for refrigeration, fluid power, and liquefied petroleum gas cooking and heating systems may be found in part 58 of this subchapter.
              (c) Class II piping systems shall be tested under working conditions as specified in the section on initial service leak test, § 56.97-38.

              Production test plate interval of testing.
              (a) At least one set of production test plates shall be welded for each Class I or Class I-L pressure vessel except as follows:
              (1) When the extent of welding on a single vessel exceeds 50 lineal feet of either or both longitudinal and circumferential joints, at least one set of test plates shall be welded for each 50 feet of joint.
              (2) When the extent of welding on vessels welded in succession exceeds 50 lineal feet of either or both longitudinal and circumferential joints, at least one set of test plates shall be welded for each 50 feet of aggregate joint of the same material where the plate thicknesses fall within a range of one-fourth inch. For each 50-foot increment of weld, test plates shall be prepared at the time of fabrication of the first vessel involving that increment.
              (b) Production test plates for Class II-L pressure vessels shall be prepared as for Classes I and I-L vessels except that the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are applicable to each 150 lineal feet of welded joint in lieu of each 50 lineal feet.
              (c) In the case of Class II pressure vessels no more than one set of production test plates need be prepared for each 300 lineal feet of either or both longitudinal and circumferential joints. In the case of single vessel fabrication a set of test plates is required for each 300 lineal feet of weld or fraction thereof. In the case of multiple vessel fabrication where each increment of 300 lineal feet of weld involves more than one pressure vessel, the set of test plates shall be prepared at the time of fabrication of the first vessel involving that increment.
            
            
              § 57.06-3
              Method of performing production testing.
              (a) Except as otherwise specified in this section a test plate shall be attached to the shell plate on one end of the longitudinal joint of each vessel as shown in Figure 57.06-3, so that the edges of the test plate to be welded are a continuation of and duplication of the corresponding edges of the longitudinal joint. For attached test plates, the weld metal shall be deposited in the test plate welding groove continuously with the weld metal deposited in the groove of the longitudinal joint. As an alternate method, the marine inspector may permit the use of separate test plates, provided the same welding process, procedure, and technique employed in the fabrication of the longitudinal joint are used in welding the test plates.
              (b) All test plates, whether attached to the shell or separate in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, shall be prepared from material of the same specification, thickness, and heat treatment and, for Class I-L and Class II-L vessels, the same heat as that of the vessel for which they are required. However, except when required to be from a specific heat, test plates may be prepared from material of a different product form, such as plate in lieu of a forging, provided the chemical composition is within the vessel material specification limits and the melting practice is the same.
              (c) Test plates are not required for welded nozzle attachments.
              (d) In the case of vessels having no longitudinal welded joints, at least one set of test plates shall be welded for each vessel, using the circumferential joint process, procedure and technique, except that the provisions of § 57.06-2(a) shall also apply for Classes I and I-L vessels, and that the provisions of § 57.06-2 (a) and (c) shall also apply for Classes II and II-L vessels.

              (e) Test plates shall be made by the same welder producing the longitudinal and circumferential joints. If more than one welder is employed in the welding of the pressure vessel(s), the test plates shall be made by the welder designated by the marine inspector. The test plates shall be of the same thickness as the material being welded and shall be of sufficient size to provide two specimens of each type required, except that in the case of pressure vessels having no longitudinal seams, the test plate need be only of sufficient length to provide one set of test specimens, and if a retest is necessary, an additional set of test plates may be welded separately.
            
            
              § 57.06-4
              Production testing specimen requirements.
              (a) For test plates three-fourths inch or less in thickness one reduced section tensile specimen and two free-bend specimens shall be tested. For plates exceeding three-fourths inch in thickness one reduced section tensile specimen, one free-bend specimen and one guided side bend specimen shall be tested. In addition boiler drums of thickness five-eighths inch or greater shall have a tension test specimen of the weld metal as required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Toughness tests are required for Classes I-L and II-L pressure vessels as specified in § 57.06-5.
              (b) The test plates shall be so supported that the warping due to welding shall not throw the finished test plate out of line by an angle of over 5°.
              (c) Where the welding has warped the test plates, the plates shall be straightened before being stress-relieved. The test plates shall be subjected to the same stress-relieving operation as required by this subchapter for the pressure vessel itself. At no time shall the test plates be heated to a temperature higher than that used for stress-relieving the vessel.
              (d) The bend specimens shall be taken from opposite sides of the reduced-section tensile specimen in their respective test plates as shown in Figures 57.06-4(d)(1) and 57.06-4(d)(2).

              (e) In submitting the samples for test the manufacturer shall state the minimum and maximum tensile range of the base metal.
              (f) The external appearances of the welds and the amount of weld reinforcement shall conform to the requirements for fabrication, and the maximum reinforcement for the test plates shall not exceed the maximum permitted for construction.

              (1) The tension-test specimen of the joint shall be transverse to the welded joint and shall be of the full thickness of the plate after the weld reinforcement has been machined flush. The form and dimensions shall be as shown in Figure 57.06-4(f)(1)(i). When the capacity of the available testing machine does not permit testing a specimen of the full thickness of the welded plate, the specimen may be cut with a thin saw into as many portions of the thickness as necessary, as shown in Figure 57.06-4(f)(1)(ii) each of which shall meet the requirements. The tensile strength of the joint specimen when it breaks in the weld shall not be less than the minimum of the specified tensile range of the plate used. If the specimen breaks in the plate at not less than 95 percent of the minimum specified tensile range of the plate and the weld shows no sign of weakness, the test is considered acceptable.
              (2) Boiler drums fabricated of plate of thicknesses of five-eighths inch or greater shall have a tension-test specimen of the weld metal machined to form as shown in Figure 57.06-4(f)(2) taken entirely from the deposited metal. The all-weld tension test specimen shall have a tensile strength of not less than the minimum of the range of the plate which is welded and shall have a minimum elongation in 2 inches of not less than 20 percent.

For plates of three-fourths inch or less in thickness one of the specimens shall be bent with the face of the weld in tension. Each freebend specimen shall be bent cold under freebending conditions until the elongation measured within or across approximately the entire weld on the outer surface of the bend is at least 30 percent, except that for Class II and Class II-L pressure vessels, the minimum elongation shall be 20 percent. When the capacity of the available testing machine will not permit testing a full thickness specimen, the specimen may be cut with a thin saw into as many portions of the thickness as necessary as shown in Figure 57.06-4(f)(1)(ii), provided each such piece retains the proportion of 11/2 to 1, width to thickness, each of which shall meet the requirements. Cracks at the corners of the specimens or small defects in the convex surface, the greatest dimensions of which do not exceed one-sixteenth inch need not be considered as failures.

The specimen shall withstand being bent cold to the full capacity of the jig without developing any crack exceeding one-eighth inch in any direction. Where the plate thickness exceeds two inches, the specimen shall be cut in two so that each portion does not exceed 2 inches in width. Each such portion shall be tested and shall meet the requirements.

              (i) One retest shall be made for each of the original specimens which fails to meet the requirements. Should the retests fail to meet the requirements, the welds which they represent shall be chipped out, rewelded and new test plates provided.

              Machinery space, noise.
              (a) Each machinery space must be designed to minimize the exposure of personnel to noise in accordance with IMO A.468(XII) (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 58.03-1). No person may encounter a 24-hour effective noise level greater than 82 dB(A) when noise is measured using a sound-level meter and an A-weighting filter.
              (b) Except as allowed by paragraph (c) of this section, no machinery space may exceed the following noise levels:
              (1) Machinery control room—75 dB(A)
              (2) Manned machinery space—90 dB(A)
              (3) Unmanned machinery space—110 dB(A)
              (4) Periodically unattended machinery space—110 dB(A)
              (5) Workshop—85 dB(A)
              (6) Any other work space around machinery—90 dB(A)
              (c) If adding a source of noise would cause a machinery space to exceed the noise level permitted by paragraph (b) of this section, the new source must be suitably insulated or isolated so that the space does not exceed that noise level. If the space is manned, a refuge from noise must be provided within the space.
              (d) Ear protection must be provided for any person entering any space with a noise level greater than 85 dB(A).
              (e) Each entrance to a machinery space with a noise level greater than 85 dB(A) must have a warning sign stating that each person entering the space must wear ear protection.

              § 58.01-55
              Tanks for flammable and combustible oil.
              (a) For the purposes of this section, a machinery space of category A is a space that contains any of the following:
              (1) Internal-combustion machinery used for main propulsion.

              (2) Internal-combustion machinery used for other than main propulsion, whose power output is equal to or greater than 500 HP (375 kw).
              (3) Any oil-fired boiler.
              (4) Any equipment used to prepare fuel oil for delivery to an oil-fired boiler, or equipment used to prepare heated oil for delivery to an internal-combustion engine, including any oil-pressure pumps, filters, and heaters dealing with oil pressures above 26 psi.
              (b) As far as practicable, each fuel-oil tank must be part of the vessel's structure and be located outside a machinery space of category A.
              (c) If a fuel-oil tank, other than a double-bottom tank, must be located adjacent to or within a machinery space of category A—
              (1) At least one of its vertical sides must be contiguous to the boundary of the machinery space;
              (2) The tank must have a common boundary with the double-bottom tanks; and
              (3) The area of the tank boundary common with the machinery spaces must be kept as small as practicable.
              (d) If a fuel-oil tank must be located within a machinery space of category A, it must not contain fuel oil with a flashpoint of less than 60 °C (140 °F).
              (e) In general, no freestanding fuel-oil tank is permitted in any machinery space of Category A on a passenger vessel. A freestanding fuel-oil tank is permitted in other spaces only if authorized by the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center. If so authorized, each freestanding fuel-oil tank must—
              (i) Comply with subpart 58.50 of this subchapter; and
              (ii) Be placed in an oil-tight spill tray with a drain pipe leading to a spill-oil tank.
              (f) No fuel-oil tank may be located where spillage or leakage from it can constitute a hazard by falling on heated surfaces. The design must also prevent any oil that may escape under pressure from any pump, filter, or heater from coming into contact with heated surfaces.

              § 58.20-10
              Pressure relieving devices.
              (a) Each pressure vessel containing refrigerants, which may be isolated, shall be protected by a relief valve set to relieve at a pressure not exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the vessel. When a pressure vessel forms an integral part of a system having a relief valve, such vessel need not have an individual relief valve.
              (b) Relief valves fitted on the high pressure side may discharge to the low pressure side before relieving to atmosphere. When relieving to atmosphere, a relief valve shall be fitted in the atmospheric discharge connection from the receivers and condensers. The relief valve from the receivers may relieve to the condenser which in turn may relieve either to the low side or to atmosphere. It shall be set to relieve at a pressure not greater than the maximum allowable working pressure. A rupture disk may be fitted in series with the relief valve, provided the bursting pressure of the rupture disk is not in excess of the relief valve set pressure. Where a rupture disk is fitted on the downstream side of the relief valve, the relief valve shall be of the type not affected by back pressure.

              (g) Except on a vessel with an integrated system of propulsion and steering, no thruster may count as part of a vessel's required steering capability.
              (h) Except for a tank vessel subject to § 58.25-85(e), each oceangoing vessel required to have power-operated steering gear must be provided with arrangements for steadying the rudder both in an emergency and during a shift from one steering gear to another. On hydraulic steering gear, a suitable arrangement of stop valves in the main piping is an acceptable means of steadying the rudder.
              (i) General arrangement plans for the main and auxiliary steering gear and their piping must be submitted for approval in accordance with subpart 50.20 of this subchapter.
              [CGD 83-043, 60 FR 24776, May 10, 1995, as amended by USCG-2003-16630, 73 FR 65187, Oct. 31, 2008]

              Main and auxiliary steering gear.
              (a) Power-operated main and auxiliary steering gear must be separate systems that are independent throughout their length. Other systems and arrangements of steering gear will be acceptable if the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center, determines that they comply with, or exceed the requirements of, this subpart.
              (b) The main steering gear and rudder stock must be—
              (1) Of adequate strength for and capable of steering the vessel at maximum ahead service speed, which must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection;
              (2) Capable of moving the rudder from 35° on either side to 35° on the other with the vessel at its deepest loadline draft and running at maximum ahead service speed, and from 35° on either side to 30° on the other in not more than 28 seconds under the same conditions;
              (3) Operated by power when necessary to comply with paragraph (b)(2) of this section or when the diameter of the rudder stock is over 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) in way of the tiller, excluding strengthening for navigation in ice; and
              (4) Designed so that they will not be damaged when operating at maximum astern speed; however, this requirement need not be proved by trials at maximum astern speed and maximum rudder angle.
              (c) The auxiliary steering gear must be—
              (1) Of adequate strength for and capable of steering the vessel at navigable speed and of being brought speedily into action in an emergency;
              (2) Capable of moving the rudder from 15° on either side to 15° on the other in not more than 60 seconds with the vessel at its deepest loadline draft and running at one-half maximum ahead service speed or 7 knots, whichever is greater; and
              (3) Operated by power when necessary to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this section or when the diameter of the rudder stock is over 23 centimeters (9 inches) in way of the tiller, excluding strengthening for navigation in ice.
              (d) No auxiliary means of steering is required on a double-ended ferryboat with independent main steering gear fitted at each end of the vessel.
              (e) When the main steering gear includes two or more identical power units, no auxiliary steering gear need be fitted, if—

              (1) In a passenger vessel, the main steering gear is capable of moving the rudder as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section while any one of the power units is not operating;
              
              (2) In a cargo vessel, the main steering gear is capable of moving the rudder as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section while all the power units are operating;
              (3) In a vessel with an installation completed on or after September 1, 1984, and on an international voyage, and in any other vessel with an installation completed after June 9, 1995, the main steering gear is arranged so that, after a single failure in its piping system (if hydraulic), or in one of the power units, the defect can be isolated so that steering capability can be maintained or speedily regained in less than ten minutes; or

              (4) In a vessel with an installation completed before September 1, 1986, and on an international voyage, with steering gear not complying with paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the installed steering gear has a proved record of reliability and is in good repair.
              
              
                Note:
                The place where isolation valves join the piping system, as by a flange, constitutes a single-failure point. The valve itself need not constitute a single-failure point if it has a double seal to prevent substantial loss of fluid under pressure. Means to purge air that enters the system as a result of the piping failure must be provided, if necessary, so that steering capability can be maintained or speedily regained in less than ten minutes.
              
              
              (f) In each vessel of 70,000 gross tons or over, the main steering gear must have two or more identical power units complying with paragraph (e) of this section.

              § 58.25-50
              Rudder stops.
              (a) Power-operated steering gear must have arrangements for cutting off power to the gear before the rudder reaches the stops. These arrangements must be synchronized with the rudder stock or with the gear itself rather than be within the control system for the steering gear, and must work by limit switches that interrupt output of the control system or by other means acceptable to the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center.
              (b) Strong and effective structural rudder stops must be fitted; except that, where adequate positive stops are provided within the steering gear, such structural stops need not be fitted.
            
            
              § 58.25-55
              Overcurrent protection for steering-gear systems.

              (a) Each feeder circuit for steering must be protected by a circuit breaker on the switchboard that supplies it and must have an instantaneous trip set at a current of at least—
              (1) 300% and not more than 375% of the rated full-load current of one steering-gear motor for a direct-current motor; or
              (2) 175% and not more than 200% of the locked-rotor current of one steering-gear motor for an alternating-current motor.
              (b) No feeder circuit for steering may have any overcurrent protection, except that required by paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) Neither a main or an auxiliary steering-gear motor, nor a motor for a steering-gear control system, may be protected by an overload protective device. The motor must have a device that activates an audible and a visible alarm at the main machinery-control station if there is an overload that would cause overheating of the motor.
              (d) No control circuit of a motor controller, steering-gear control system, or indicating or alarm system may have overcurrent protection except short-circuit protection that is instantaneous and rated at 400% to 500% of—
              (1) The current-carrying capacity of the conductor; or
              (2) The normal load of the system.
              (e) The short-circuit protective device for each steering-gear control system must be in the steering-gear compartment and in the control circuit immediately following the disconnect switch for the system.
              (f) When, in a vessel of less than 1,600 gross tons, an auxiliary steering gear, which § 58.25-10(c)(3) requires to be operated by power, is not operated by electric power or is operated by an electric motor primarily intended for other service, the main steering gear may be fed by one circuit from the main switchboard. When such an electric motor is arranged to operate an auxiliary steering gear, neither § 58.25-25(e) nor paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section need be complied with if both the overcurrent protection and compliance with §§ 58.25-25(d), 58.25-30, and 58.25-70 (j) and (k) satisfy the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center.

              (2) In case of loss of steering capability due to a single failure either of any part of the piping systems or in one of the power units, steering capability can be regained in not more than 45 seconds.
              (e) On each tank vessel of less than 70,000 deadweight tons, constructed before, and with a steering-gear installation before, September 1, 1986, and on an international voyage, the steering gear not complying with paragraph (c) (1), (2), or (3) of this section, as applicable, may continue in service if the steering gear has a proved record of reliability and is in good repair.
              (f) Each tank vessel of 10,000 gross tons or over, constructed before, and with a steering-gear installation before, September 1, 1984, must—
              (1) Meet the applicable requirements in §§ 58.25-15, 58.25-20(c), 58.25-25 (a), (d), and (e), and 58.25-70 (e), (h), (i), and (j);
              (2) Ensure working access to machinery and controls in the steering-gear compartment (which must include handrails and either gratings or other non-slip surfaces to ensure a safe working environment in case hydraulic fluid leaks);

              (3) Have two separate and independent steering-gear control systems, each of which can be operated from the pilothouse; except that it need not have separate steering wheels or steering levers;
              (4) Arrange each system required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section so that, if the one in operation fails, the other can be operated from the pilothouse immediately; and

              (i) Used for no other purpose; and either—
              (ii) Connected in the steering-gear compartment to the circuit supplying power to the power unit or units operated by that system; or
              (iii) Connected directly to the busbars supplying the circuit for its steering-gear power unit or units at a point on the switchboard adjacent to that supply.
              (g) Each tank vessel of 40,000 gross tons or over, constructed before, and with a steering-gear installation before, September 1, 1984, and on an international voyage, must have the steering gear arranged so that, in case of a single failure of the piping or of one of the power units, either steering capability equivalent to that required of the auxiliary steering gear by § 58.25-10(c)(2) can be maintained or the rudder's movement can be limited so that steering capability can be speedily regained in less than 10 minutes. This arrangement must be achieved by—
              (1) An independent means of restraining the rudder;
              (2) Fast-acting valves that may be manually operated to isolate the actuator or actuators from the external hydraulic piping, together with a means of directly refilling the actuators by a fixed, independent, power-operated pump and piping; or

              (3) An arrangement such that, if hydraulic-power actuating systems are connected, loss of hydraulic fluid from one system must be detected and the defective system isolated either automatically or from within the pilothouse so that the other system remains fully operational.
              
              
                Note:
                The term “piping or * * * one of the power units” in paragraph (g) of this section refers to the pressure-containing components in hydraulic or electro-hydraulic steering gear. It does not include rudder actuators or hydraulic-control servo piping and pumps used to stroke the pump or valves of the power unit, unless their failure would result in failure of the unit or of the piping to the actuator.

              Scope.
              (a) This subpart contains requirements for fluid power transmission and control systems and appurtenances. Except as otherwise provided for in this section, these requirements are applicable to the following fluid power and control systems:
              (1) Steering apparatus, main and auxiliary, including bow thruster systems.
              (2) Cargo hatch operating systems unless fitted with an alternate mechanical means of operation and approved by the Commandant as hydraulically or pneumatically fail-safe. A system is considered to be fail-safe if a component failure will result in a slow and controlled release of the loading so as not to endanger personnel.
              (3) Watertight door operating system.
              (4) Automatic propulsion boiler system.
              (5) Starting systems for internal combustion engines used for main propulsion, main or auxiliary power, as the prime mover for any required emergency apparatus, or as the source of propulsion power in ship maneuvering thruster systems.
              (6) Centralized control system of main propulsion and auxiliary machinery.
              (7) Lifeboat handling equipment.

              (10) All systems containing a pneumatic or hydropneumatic accumulator. In the case of hydropneumatic accumulators where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that due to friction losses, constriction, or other design features, the hazard of explosive rupture does not exist downstream of a certain point in the hydraulic system, the requirements of this subpart will apply only to the accumulator and the system upstream of this point.
              (11) Materials and/or personnel handling equipment systems, i.e. cranes, hydraulic elevators, etc., not approved by the Commandant as fail-safe as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (12) Any fluid power or control system installed in the cargo area of pump rooms on a tank vessel, or in spaces in which cargo is handled on a liquefied flammable gas carrier.
              (13) All pneumatic power and control systems having a maximum allowable working pressure in excess of 150 pounds per square inch.
              (14) Any other hydraulic or pneumatic system on board that, in the judgment of the Commandant, constitutes a hazard to the seaworthiness of the ship or the safety of personnel either in normal operation or in case of failure.
              (b) Other fluid power and control systems do not have to comply with the detailed requirements of this subpart but must meet the requirements of § 58.30-50.

            Subpart 59.10—Welding Repairs to Boilers and Pressure Vessels in ­Service
            
              § 59.10-1
              Scope.
              (a) Repairs to boilers or pressure vessels in service may be performed by welding provided the welding meets the applicable requirements of part 57 of this subchapter.
              (b) No repairs by welding shall be made except temporary emergency repairs without prior approval of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. Emergency repairs shall be replaced with permanent repairs meeting the requirements of this subchapter when the vessel returns to a port in which an Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, is located except in the case of minor repairs which in the opinion of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, do not materially affect the safety of the boiler or pressure vessel.
              (c) Repair welding of power boilers, not meeting the requirements of subpart 52.05 of this subchapter, is prohibited unless the stress is carried by such other type(s) of construction complying with the requirements of this subchapter, and where the adequacy of the boiler design is not solely dependent upon the strength of the welds.

              (d) Only welded repairs as specified in this subchapter are permitted on boilers and pressure vessels. The welding repairs allowed by this subpart apply only to boilers and pressure vessels fabricated of carbon steel. Welding repairs to boilers and pressure vessels fabricated of alloy steel will be given special consideration by the Commandant. Such other method of repairs by means of welding not covered in this subchapter shall be referred to the Commandant and may be authorized by him, if in his opinion, it meets the intent of this subchapter.
            
            
              § 59.10-5
              Cracks.
              (a) Cracks extending from the calking edge of plates to the rivet holes of circumferential joints may be welded provided the cracks are veed out so that complete penetration of the weld metal is secured.
              (b) Circumferential cracks from rivet hole to rivet hole in girth joints may be welded provided there are not more than three consecutive cracked ligaments nor more than a total of six cracked ligaments in any one girth joint.
              (c) Cracks in staybolted plates may be welded provided they are located entirely within staybolted areas and the total length of any crack or series of consecutive cracks does not exceed two staybolt pitches.
              (d) Cracks in plain, circular or Adamson ring or similar type furnaces may be welded provided any one crack does not exceed 12 inches in length and after completion the weld is stress-relieved. Cracks in corrugated furnaces may be repaired by welding provided any one crack does not exceed 20 inches in length.
              (e) Fire cracks may be welded at riveted door openings extending from the edge of the plate, but not more than 2 inches beyond the centerline of the rivet holes.
              (f) Cracks may be welded between tube holes in the shell of water tube boiler drums, provided there are not more than two cracks in any one row in any direction, nor more than a total of four cracks in a drum, and further provided the welding meets the requirements of this subchapter for Class I welded pressure vessels and is approved by the Commandant.
              (g) Cracks that occur in superheater manifolds, water wallheaders, water drums, sectional headers, and other appurtenances including steam manifolds of water tube boilers may be repaired in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section if the repair is approved.
              (h) All cracks permitted to be repaired under this subpart shall be excavated to sound metal by grinding, flame or arc gouging or chipping out the defective metal to form a clean welding groove. The first two methods of excavation are preferable. Either a V groove or U groove wherein complete penetration of the weld metal is secured may be used. After excavation is completed and prior to welding, the excavated area shall be examined by magnetic particle, dye penetrant, or other acceptable test method. When the reverse side of the weld is accessible the root of the weld shall be chipped or ground out to insure a clean surface of the originally deposited metal and the resultant groove welded to obtain a sound weld having complete penetration. When the weld cannot be back chipped because the reverse side is inaccessible, a backing strip or other approved means of assuring full penetration shall be employed.
              (i) During welding of cracks a preheat shall be maintained by controlled temperatures. The degree of preheat shall be determined by the rules listed in accordance with the materials P-number groupings of PW-38, section I, appendix R, section VIII and Table Q. 11.1, section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (all incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 59.01-2). For thicknesses exceeding three-fourths inch, suitable U grooves should be employed. A welding sequence shall be used so as to equalize welding stresses.
              (j) Postweld heat treatment of repaired cracks shall be performed in accordance with the rules specified in PW-39, section I and UW-40, section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code for boilers and pressure vessels respectively.
              (k) Welded repairs of cracks shall be nondestructively tested in accordance with the rules specified in PW-40, section I, and UW-51, section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code for boilers and pressure vessels respectively.
              (l) After cracks originating in tube or rivet holes are repaired by welding, the holes shall be properly reamed and the weld reinforcing ground flush with the plate in way of rivet heads.

              (m) Flat tube sheets in fire-tube boilers which have corroded or where cracks exist in the ligaments may be repaired by welding.
              
              (n) Welding repairs to drums of power boilers, except as otherwise permitted in this subpart, are prohibited.

              § 59.10-10
              Corroded surfaces.
              (a) Corroded surfaces in the calking edges of circumferential seams may be built up by welding to the original thickness under the following conditions:
              (1) The thickness of the original metal to be built up between the rivet holes and the calking edge shall not be less than one-fourth of the diameter of the rivet hole, and the portion of the calking edge to be thus reinforced shall not exceed 30 inches in length in a circumferential direction.
              (2) In all repairs to circumferential seams by welding, the rivets shall be removed over the portions to be welded for a distance of at least 6 inches beyond the repaired portion.
              (3) After repairs are made the rivet holes shall be reamed before the rivets are redriven.
              (b) It is not permissible to build up or reinforce a grooved or corroded area of unstayed internal surfaces by means of welding, except that widely scattered pit holes may be built up by welding.
              (c) Where external corrosion has reduced the thickness of flat plates around hand holes to an extent of not more than 40 percent of the original thickness and for a distance not exceeding 2 inches from the edge of the hole, the plate may be built up by welding.
              (d) Where stayed sheets have corroded to a depth not exceeding 40 percent of their original thickness, they may be reinforced or built up by welding. Where the staybolts are fitted with riveted heads, the staybolts in the reinforced area shall be renewed in accordance with the provisions of § 52.20-15 of this subchapter, but where the staybolts are fitted with nuts, the nuts may be removed and after reinforcing has been applied, collars may be welded around the staybolts in lieu of the nuts. Such reinforced areas shall not exceed 400 square inches nor more than 30 inches in one direction. Two such areas in any one plate may be reinforced: Provided, that the distance between the reinforced surfaces is not less than 30 inches.
              (e) When the corroded portion of a staybolted surface exceeds 400 square inches, it is permissible to make repairs by cutting out the defective portion and replacing it with a new plate, the edges of the new plate to be welded in position. In such cases, new staybolts shall be fitted in accordance with the requirements of § 52.20-15 of this subchapter and where welding is performed through a line of staybolts, welded collars as required by Figure 52.01-3 of this subchapter shall be used to attach the staybolts.
              (f) Eroded seams of welded pressure vessels may be repaired by rewelding the wasted portion. The wasted section of the seam shall be excavated sufficiently by grinding, flame or arc gouging or chipping to ensure proper weld penetration. Rewelded seams shall be nondestructively tested in accordance with section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 59.01-2).

              § 59.10-15
              Rivets and staybolts.
              (a) It is not permitted to reinforce or build up by welding the heads of rivets or staybolts that have deteriorated. Such rivets or staybolts shall be replaced. The seal welding of rivet heads to secure tightness is prohibited.
              (b) Where leaks develop around staybolts which are otherwise in good condition, the nuts may be replaced with a beveled collar formed around the end of the stay by means of welding. In such cases, the depth of collar measured on the stay and the width measured on the plate, shall be equal to one-half the diameter of the staybolt.
            
            
              § 59.10-20
              Patches in shells and tube sheets.

              (a) Unreinforced openings in the shells or drums of boilers or pressure vessels, the diameter of which does not exceed the maximum diameter of an unreinforced opening in accordance with § 52.01-100 of this subchapter may be closed by the use of a patch or plate inside the drum or shell and sealed against leakage by welding. Such plates shall have a diameter of at least 2 inches larger than the diameter of the hole and shall have a thickness equal to the thickness of the plate to which it is attached. It is not permissible to insert such patches in the shell or head flush with the surrounding plate unless the requirements of this subchapter for Class I welded pressure vessels are met.
              (b) Portions of tube sheets which have deteriorated may be renewed by replacing the wasted portion with a new section. The ligaments between the tube holes may be joined by means of welding and staytubes. Other acceptable means of lowering the stress on the repaired section may be used if in the judgment of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, it is necessary.
            
            
              § 59.10-25
              Stayed areas.
              Welding repairs are permitted in staybolted areas or areas adequately stayed by other means so that should failure of the welds occur the stress will be carried by the stays. The welds shall be located entirely within staybolted areas and shall not pass through the outer row of stays.
            
            
              § 59.10-30
              Seal welding.
              Where leaks occur in riveted joints or connections, they shall be carefully investigated to determine the cause. Such leaks may be made tight by seal welding the edge, if, in the opinion of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, this will make a satisfactory repair.
            
            
              § 59.10-35
              Wrapper plates and back heads.
              Wrapper plates and back heads may be renewed in whole or repaired as follows:
              (a) Wrapper plates or backs heads shall be cut between two rows of staybolts or on a line of staybolts where the thickness is approximately the same as the original construction. If welding is employed on a line of staybolts, the staybolts shall be fitted with a welded collar as required by Figure 52.01-3 of this subchapter.
              (b) The edges of wrapper plates riveted to tube sheets and back heads shall be removed by cutting out the rivets.
              (c) The edges of existing plates and new plates shall be beveled by chipping, flame cutting or grinding so as to form a suitable groove whereby complete penetration of the weld metal will be obtained. The edge preparation and preheat shall comply with the requirements of § 59.10-5(h).
              (d) The edges of the new plate shall be buttwelded and the plate shall be riveted to the flanges of the tube sheet and back heads and the staybolts renewed.
              (e) Sections of wrapper plates of combustion chambers outside of stayed areas may be repaired by welding provided the welded joints are stress-relieved by means of controlled heat and the joints are nondestructively tested.
            
          
          
            Subpart 59.15—Miscellaneous Boiler Repairs
            
              § 59.15-1
              Furnace repairs.
              (a) Where corrugated or plain furnaces or flues are distorted by 11/2 inches or more, they shall be repaired by either of the following methods:
              (1) The furnace shall be forced back to a true circular shape, and the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, may require strongbacks or other acceptable means of support to hold the furnace from future collapse, if in his opinion such support is necessary; or,
              (2) The furnace shall be adequately stayed as found necessary in the judgment of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.
              (b) Distortion means the difference between any single measured diameter of the furnace and the diameter of a true circle at the same location. The diameter of the true circle may be taken as the original furnace diameter or may be determined by a means acceptable to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.

              (c) Where the distortion does not exceed 11/2 inches it will not be necessary to force the furnace back to a true circle if the allowable pressure is reduced in the ratio of 11/2 percent for each one-tenth of an inch of distortion. However, if the maximum distortion does not exceed 1 inch and the length of the distorted area is not more than three corrugations, or, if the maximum distortion does not exceed three-fourths inch for a length greater than three corrugations of distorted area, the repairs or reduction in pressure will not be required unless considered necessary by the marine inspector.
              (d) When it becomes necessary to rivet a patch to a furnace or other part of the heating surface, the riveted patch shall be placed on the waterside of the plate in order not to form a pocket in which sediment may collect.
              (e) Furnace crowns which have become distorted, not in excess of the limitations provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may be repaired by pumping back the distorted section to as nearly a true circle as possible and reinforcing the same by means of a ring, arc- or gas-welded to the distorted corrugation as shown in Figure 59.15-1, the welding to be done by welders and welding processors qualified in accordance with part 57 of this subchapter using acceptable welding electrodes in accordance with § 57.02-4 of this subchapter.

              (b) Where the shell plate is bagged due to overheating, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, may, if in his judgment it is practicable, permit the same to be driven back to its original position.
              
              (c) Where the shell plate has blistered, bagged, or bulged to such an extent that there is an appreciable thinning of the plate, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, shall require the defective portion to be cut away and the shell repaired by fitting a patch of steel plate conforming to the requirements of § 52.01-90 of this subchapter in place of the defective portion. Care shall be taken that the riveting schedule of the patch is so arranged as to give the plate sufficient strength to withstand the stress placed on it in service.

              § 61.05-10
              Boilers in service.
              (a) Each boiler, including superheater, reheater, economizer, auxiliary boiler, low-pressure heating boiler, and unfired steam boiler, must be available for examination by the marine inspector at intervals specified by Table 61.05-10, and more often if necessary, to determine that the complete unit is in a safe and satisfactory condition. When a hydrostatic test is required, the marine inspector may examine all accessible parts of the boiler while it is under pressure.
              (b) The owner, master, or person in charge of the vessel shall give ample notice to the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, so that a marine inspector may witness the tests and make the required inspections.

              (c) Firetube boilers which cannot be entered or which cannot be satisfactorily examined internally, all boilers of lap seam construction and all boilers to which extensive repairs have been made or the strength of which the marine inspector has any reason to question, shall be subjected to a hydrostatic test of 11/2 times the maximum allowable working pressure. All other boilers shall be subjected to a hydrostatic test of 11/4 times the maximum allowable working pressure.
              (d) In applying hydrostatic pressure to boilers, arrangements shall be made to prevent main and auxiliary stop valves from being simultaneously subjected to the hydrostatic pressure on one side and steam pressure on the other side.
              (e) If the marine inspector has reason to believe that the boiler has deteriorated to any appreciable extent under the bottom where it rests on saddles or foundations, he shall cause the boiler to be lifted to such position that it can be thoroughly examined, provided the examination cannot be made otherwise.
              (f) The marine inspector may require any boiler to be drilled or gaged to determine actual thickness any time its safety is in doubt. At the first inspection for certification after a firetube or flue boiler has been installed for 10 years, it shall be gaged to determine the extent of deterioration. Thickness will be measured at or near the waterline, at the bottom and at such other places deemed necessary by the marine inspector. Examination may be by drilling or a nondestructive means acceptable to the marine inspector. Prior to the use of a nondestructive method of examination, the user shall demonstrate to the marine inspector that results having an accuracy within plus or minus 5 percent are consistently obtainable when using specimens similar to those to be examined on the boiler.
              (g) If the thickness is found to be less than the original thickness upon which the maximum allowable working pressure was based, it shall be recalculated. The thickness of the thinnest measured portion shall be used in this calculation. Either the design formulas given in this subchapter or the ones in effect when the boiler was contracted for or built may normally be used in this recalculation. In no case will an increase in the pressure allowed be made.

              § 61.10-5
              Pressure vessels in service.
              (a) Basic requirements. Each pressure vessel must be examined or tested every 5 years. The extent of the test or examination should be that necessary to determine that the pressure vessel's condition is satisfactory and that the pressure vessel is fit for the service intended.
              (b) Internal and external tests and inspections. (1) Each pressure vessel listed on the Certificate of Inspection must be thoroughly examined externally every 5 years.
              (2) In addition, each pressure vessel listed on the Certificate of Inspection that is fitted with a manhole or other inspection opening so it can be satisfactorily examined internally, must be opened for internal examination every 5 years.
              (3) No pressure vessel need be hydrostatically tested except when a defect is found that, in the marine inspector's opinion, may affect the safety of the pressure vessel. In this case, the pressure vessel should be hydrostatically tested at a pressure of 11/2 times the maximum allowable working pressure.
              (c) Special purpose vessels. (1) If your vessel's Certificate of Inspection is renewed annually, the following must be examined under operating conditions at each inspection for certification: all tubular heat exchangers, hydraulic accumulators, and all pressure vessels used in refrigeration service.
              (2) If your vessel's Certificate of Inspection is renewed less often than annually, the following must be examined under operating conditions twice every 5 years: all tubular heat exchangers, hydraulic accumulators, and all pressure vessels used in refrigeration service.
              (3) No more than 3 years may elapse between any examination and its immediate predecessor.
              (d) Hydrostatic tests under pressure. Each pressure vessel, other than one exempted by this section, must be subjected to a hydrostatic test at a pressure of 11/4 times the maximum allowable working pressure twice within any five-year period, except that no more than three years may elapse between any test and its immediate predecessor.
              (e) Exemptions from hydrostatic tests. The following pressure vessels will not normally be subjected to a hydrostatic test:
              (1) Tubular heat exchangers.
              
              (2) Pressure vessels used in refrigeration service.
              (3) Hydraulic accumulators.
              (4) Pressure vessels which have been satisfactorily examined internally by a marine inspector and in which no defects have been found which impair the safety of the pressure vessel.
              (5) Pressure vessels which were initially pneumatically tested in accordance with part 54 of this subchapter.
              (6) Pressure vessels not stamped with the Coast Guard Symbol.
              (f) Compressed gas or hazardous liquid pressure vessel tests. Cargo tanks of pressure vessel configuration containing liquefied, compressed gases or hazardous liquids must be inspected and tested as required by the applicable regulations published in subchapter D or subchapter I of this chapter.
              (g) Bulk storage tanks. Each bulk storage tank containing refrigerated liquefied CO2 for use aboard a vessel as a fire-extinguishing agent shall be subjected to a hydrostatic test of 11/2 times the maximum allowable working pressure in the tenth year of the installation and at ten-year intervals thereafter. After the test, the tank should be drained and an internal examination made. Parts of the jacket and lagging on the underside of the tank designated by the marine inspector must be removed at the time of the test so the marine inspector may determine the external condition of the tank.
              (h) Pneumatic tests.

              (9) Water level controls. Water level controls must be tested by slowly lowering the water level in the boiler. Each operating water level control must be individually tested. The upper low water cutoff and the lower low water cutoff must each be tested. The audible alarm and visible indicator associated with the lower low water cutoff must be tested. The manual reset device must be tested after the lower low water cutoff has been activated.
              (10) Feed water flow controls. The feed water flow limit device (found on steam boilers and water heaters without water level controls) must be tested by interrupting the feed water supply. Manual reset must be required prior to restarting the boiler.
              (11) Low voltage test. The fuel supply to the burners must automatically shut off when the supply voltage is lowered.
              (12) Switches. All switches must be tested to verify satisfactory operation.

Control must include automatic performance of all associated services, and must not permit rate of movement of the control device to overload the propulsion machinery.
              (2) On vessels propelled by steam turbines, the navigation bridge primary control system must include safety limit controls for high and low boiler water levels and low steam pressure. Actuation of these limits must be alarmed on the navigating bridge and at the maneuvering platform or ECC.
              (3) On vessels propelled by internal combustion engines, an alarm must annunciate on the navigating bridge and at the maneuvering platform or ECC, if provided, to indicate starting capability less than 50% of that required by § 62.35-35. If the primary remote control system provides automatic starting, the number of automatic consecutive attempts that fail to produce a start must be limited to reserve 50% of the required starting capability.
              (d) Transfer of control location. Transfer of control location must meet section 4-9-2/5.11 of the ABS Steel Vessel Rules (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 62.05-1). Manual alternative-propulsion-control locations must be capable of overriding, and of operating independent of, all remote and automatic propulsion-control locations.
              (e) Control system details. (1) Each operator control device must have a detent at the zero thrust position.
              (2) Propulsion machinery automatic safety trip control operation must only occur when continued operation could result in serious damage, complete breakdown, or explosion of the equipment. Other than the overrides mentioned in § 62.25-10(a)(4) and temporary overrides located at the main navigating bridge control location, overrides of these safety trip controls are prohibited. Operation of permitted overrides must be alarmed at the navigating bridge and at the maneuvering platform or ECC, as applicable, and must be guarded against inadvertent operation.
              (3) Remote propulsion control systems must be failsafe by maintaining the preset (as is) speed and direction of thrust until local manual or alternate manual control is in operation, or the manual safety trip control operates. Failure must activate alarms on the navigating bridge and in the machinery spaces.

              (b) Feedwater control. Automatic feedwater control subsystems must sense, at a minimum, boiler water level and steam flow.
              (c) Combustion control. Automatic combustion control subsystems must provide—
              (1) An air/fuel ratio which ensures complete combustion and stable flame with the fuel in use, under light off, steady state, and transient conditions; and
              (2) Stable boiler steam pressure and outlet temperatures under steady state and transient load conditions; and
              (3) A low fire interlock to prevent high firing rates and superheater damage during boiler warm up.
              (d) Programming control. The programming control must provide a programed sequence of interlocks for the safe ignition and normal shutdown of the boiler burners. The programming control must prevent ignition if unsafe conditions exist and must include the following minimum sequence of events and interlocks:
              (1) Prepurge. Boilers must undergo a continuous purge of the combustion chamber and convecting spaces to make sure of a minimum of 5 changes of air. The purge must not be less than 15 seconds in duration, and must occur immediately prior to the trial for ignition of the initial burner of a boiler. All registers and dampers must be open and an air flow of at least 25 percent of the full load volumetric air flow must be proven before the purge period commences. The prepurge must be complete before trial for ignition of the initial burner.
              
              
                Note:
                A pre-purge is not required immediately after a complete post-purge.

              (iii) The burner igniter must be in position and proven energized before admission of fuel to the boiler. The igniter must remain energized until the burner flame is established and stable, or until the trial for ignition period ends.
              (iv) The trial for ignition period must be as short as practical for the specific installation, but must not exceed 15 seconds.
              (v) Failure of the burner to ignite during a trial for ignition must automatically actuate the burner safety trip controls.
              (3) Post-purge. (i) Immediately after normal shutdown of the boiler, an automatic purge of the boiler equal to the volume and duration of the prepurge must occur.
              (ii) Following boiler safety trip control operation, the air flow to the boiler must not automatically increase. Post purge in such cases must be under manual control.
              (e) Burner fuel oil valves. Each burner must be provided with a valve that is—
              (1) Automatically closed by the burner or boiler safety trip control system; and
              (2) Operated by the programming control or combustion control subsystems, as applicable.
              (f) Master fuel oil valves. Each boiler must be provided with a master fuel oil valve to stop fuel to the boiler automatically upon actuation by the boiler safety trip control system.
              (g) Valve closure time. The valves described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section must close within 4 seconds of automatic detection of unsafe trip conditions.

            Subpart 62.50—Automated Self-propelled Vessel Manning
            
              § 62.50-1
              General.
              (a) Where automated systems are provided to replace specific personnel in the control and observation of the engineering plant and spaces, or reduce overall crew requirements, the arrangements must make sure that under all sailing conditions, including maneuvering, the safety of the vessel is equal to that of the same vessel with the entire plant under fully attended direct manual supervision.
              (b) Coast Guard acceptance of automated systems to replace specific personnel or to reduce overall crew requirements is predicated upon—
              (1) The capabilities of the automated systems;
              (2) The combination of the personnel, equipment, and systems necessary to ensure the safety of the vessel, personnel, and environment in all sailing conditions, including maneuvering;
              (3) The ability of the crew to perform all operational evolutions, including emergencies such as fire or control or monitoring system failure;
              (4) A planned maintenance program including routine maintenance, inspection, and testing to ensure the continued safe operation of the vessel; and

              (5) The automated system's demonstrated reliability during an initial trial period, and its continuing reliability.
              
              
                Note:
                The cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, (OCMI) also determines the need for more or less equipment depending on the vessel characteristics, route, or trade.
              
              
              (c) Equipment provided to replace specific personnel or to reduce overall crew requirements that proves unsafe or unreliable in the judgment of the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, must be immediately replaced or repaired or vessel manning will be modified to compensate for the equipment inadequacy.
            
            
              
              § 62.50-20
              Additional requirements for minimally attended machinery plants.
              
                Note:
                Minimally attended machinery plants include vessel machinery plants and spaces that are automated, but not to a degree where the plant could be left unattended. Emphasis is placed on the centralized remote control and monitoring of the machinery plant and machinery spaces.
              
              
              (a) General. (1) Navigating bridge propulsion control must be provided.
              (2) An ECC must be provided and must include the automatic and remote control and monitoring systems necessary to limit the operator's activity to monitoring the plant, initiating programmed control system sequences, and taking appropriate action in an emergency.
              (3) The ECC must include control and monitoring of all vital engineering systems, including—
              (i) The propulsion plant and its auxiliaries;
              (ii) Electrical power generation and distribution;
              (iii) Machinery space fire detection, alarm, and extinguishing systems; and
              (iv) Machinery space flooding safety systems, except the valves described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.

              (4) ECC control of vital systems must include the ability to place required standby systems, auxiliaries, and power sources in operation, unless automatic transfer is provided, and to shut down such equipment when necessary.
              
              
                Note:
                ECC remote control need not include means for a single operator to bring the plant to standby from a cold plant or dead ship condition or controls for non-vital systems or equipment.
              
              
              (b) Alarms and instrumentation. (1) A personnel alarm must be provided and must annunciate on the bridge if not routinely acknowledged at the ECC or in the machinery spaces.
              (2) Continuous or demand instrumentation displays must be provided at the ECC to meet the system and equipment monitoring requirements of this part if the ECC is to be continuously attended. If the watchstander's normal activities include maintenance, a roving watch, or similar activities in the machinery spaces but not at the ECC, both alarms and instrumentation must be provided.
              (3) All required audible alarms must annunciate throughout the ECC and machinery spaces.
              (c) Fire detection and alarms. An approved automatic fire detection and alarm system must be provided to monitor all machinery spaces. The system must activate all alarms at the ECC, the navigating bridge, and throughout the machinery spaces and engineers' accommodations. The ECC and bridge alarms must visually indicate which machinery space is on fire, as applicable.
              
              
                Note:
                For purposes of this part, the specific location of fires that are not in machinery spaces need not be indicated.
              
              
              (d) Fire pumps. (1) The ECC must include control of the main machinery space fire pumps.
              (2) Remote control of a required fire pump must be provided from the navigating bridge. Where one or more fire pumps is required to be independent of the main machinery space, at least one such pump must be controlled from the navigating bridge.
              (e) Flooding safety. (1) Machinery space bilges, bilge wells, shaft alley bilges, and other minimally attended locations where liquids might accumulate must be monitored from the ECC to detect flooding angles from vertical of up to 15° heel and 5° trim.
              (2) The ECC must include the controls necessary to bring at least one independent bilge pump and independent bilge suction required by § 56.50-50(e) of this chapter into operation to counter flooding.
              (3) Where watertight doors in subdivision bulkheads are required in the machinery spaces, they must be Class 3 watertight doors and must be controllable from the ECC and the required navigating bridge control location.

              (4) Controls must be provided to operate the sea inlet and discharge valves required by § 56.50-95(d) of this chapter and the emergency bilge suction required by § 56.50-50(f). These controls must be arranged to allow time for operation in the event of flooding with the vessel in the fully loaded condition. Time considerations must include detection, crew response, and control operation time.
              
              (f) Communications. (1) A means must be provided at the ECC to selectively summon any engineering department member from the engineering accommodations to the ECC.
              (2) The voice communications system required by § 113.30-5(a) of this chapter must also include the engineering officers' accommodations.
              (g) Electrical systems. (1) The ECC must include the controls and instrumentation necessary to place the ship service and propulsion generators in service in 30 seconds.
              (2) The main distribution and propulsion switchboards and generator controls must either be located at the ECC, if the ECC is within the boundaries of the main machinery space, or the controls and instrumentation required by part 111 of this chapter must be duplicated at the ECC. Controls at the switchboard must be able to override those at the ECC, if separate. Also see § 111.12-11(g) and § 111.30-1 regarding switchboard location.
              (h) Maintenance program. (1) The vessel must have a planned maintenance program to ensure continued safe operation of all vital systems. Program content and detail is optional, but must include maintenance and repair manuals for work to be accomplished by maintenance personnel and checkoff lists for routine inspection and maintenance procedures.

              § 62.50-30
              Additional requirements for periodically unattended machinery plants.
              
                Note:
                Periodically unattended machinery plants include machinery plants and spaces that are automated to the degree that they are self-regulating and self-monitoring and could safely be left periodically unattended. Emphasis is placed on providing systems that act automatically until the crew can take action in the event of a failure or emergency. Requirements are in addition to those of a minimally attended machinery plant.
              
              
              (a) General. The requirements of this section must be met in addition to those of § 62.50-20 of this part.
              (b) Automatic transfer. Redundant vital auxiliaries and power sources must automatically transfer to the backup units upon failure of operating units.
              (c) Fuel systems. Each system for the service or treatment of fuel must meet section 4-6-4/13.5 of the ABS Steel Vessel Rules (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 62.05-1).

              § 63.25-3
              Electric hot water supply boilers.
              (a) Electric hot water supply boilers that have a capacity not greater than 454 liters (120 U.S. gallons), a heat input rate not greater than 200,000 Btu/hr. (58.6 kilowatts), meet the requirements of UL 174 or UL 1453 (both incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 63.05-1), and are protected by the relief device(s) required in 46 CFR 53.05-2 do not have to meet any other requirements of this section except the periodic testing required by paragraph (j) of this section. Electric hot water supply boilers that meet the requirements of UL 174 may have temperature-pressure relief valves that meet the requirements of ANSI/AGA Z21.22 (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 63.05-1) in lieu of 46 CFR subpart 53.05.
              (b) Each hot water supply boiler must be constructed in accordance with the applicable requirements of part 52 or part 53 of this chapter.
              (c) Branch circuit conductors for hot water supply boilers which have a capacity not greater than 454 liters (120 U.S. gallons) must have a current carrying capacity of not less than 125 percent of the current rating of the appliance. Branch circuit conductors for hot water supply boilers with capacities of more than 454 liters (120 U.S. gallons) must have a current carrying capacity of not less than 100 percent of the current rating of the appliance. Wiring materials and methods must comply with part 111, subpart 111.60 of this chapter. A hot water supply boiler having a current rating of more than 48 amperes and employing resistance type heating elements must have the heating elements on subdivided circuits. Each subdivided load, except for an electric hot water supply boiler employing a resistance type immersion electric heating element, must not exceed 48 amperes, and it must be protected at not more than 60 amperes. An electric hot water supply boiler employing a resistance type immersion electric heating element may be subdivided into circuits not exceeding 120 amperes and protected at not more than 150 amperes. Overcurrent protection devices must comply with part 111, subpart 111.50 of this chapter.

              (d) Heating elements must be insulated electrically from the water being heated, guarded against mechanical injury and contact with outside objects, and securely supported. Consideration must be given to sagging, opening, and other adverse conditions of the elements resulting from continuous heating, and flexion of supports and wiring due to alternate heating and cooling. Wrap-around elements must be secured in a manner which prevents loosening.
              (e) Iron and steel parts must be protected against corrosion by enameling, galvanizing, or plating. Iron and steel storage tanks having a wall thickness less than 6.4mm (1/4-inch) must have the inside surface protected against corrosion.
              (f) Each heating element must have a temperature regulating device. The device must limit the water from obtaining a temperature greater than 90 °C (194 °F). If the control has a marked off position, the control must disconnect the heating element from all ungrounded conductors, and it must not respond to temperature when placed in the off position.
              (g) An independent temperature limiting device must prevent the water in the upper 25 percent of the tank from attaining a temperature higher than 99 °C (210 °F). This device must require manual resetting, be trip free from the operating means, open all ungrounded power supply conductors to the heater, and be readily accessible.
              (h) Electric hot water supply boilers must have pressure and temperature relieving valves. The valve temperature setting must not be more than 99 °C (210 °F). The pressure relief setting must not be higher than the marked working pressure of the boiler. The pressure and temperature relief valves must meet part 53, subpart 53.05 of this chapter. The pressure and temperature relief valves may be combined into a pressure-temperature relief valve.
              (i) Electric hot water supply boilers must be marked in a visible location with the manufacturer's name, model or other identification number, water capacity, and the electrical ratings of each heating element. When two or more heating elements are installed, the maximum wattage or current consumption must be indicated. The cold water inlet and the hot water outlet must each be clearly distinguished or marked for identification purposes.
              (j) All electric hot water supply boilers must have their pressure relief devices tested as required by 46 CFR part 52 or part 53, as applicable. Electric hot water supply boilers that meet the requirements of UL 174 or UL 1453 and have heating elements, temperature regulating controls, and temperature limiting controls are satisfactory for installation and service without further installation testing. All electric hot water supply boilers not meeting the requirements of UL 174 or UL 1453 must have their heating elements, temperature regulating controls, and temperature limiting controls tested by the marine inspector at the time of installation.

              § 63.25-5
              Fired thermal fluid heaters.
              (a) Construction. Fired thermal fluid heaters must meet the requirements of part 52 of this chapter, as applicable.
              (b) Controls. Fired thermal fluid heaters must have a low fluid level cutout device or a low flow device. When the rate of fluid flow through the heating coils is insufficient to ensure proper heat transfer, the device must cut off the fuel supply to the burner. If the fluid temperature exceeds the designed maximum operating temperature, a high temperature limit device must cut off the fuel supply to the burner. These devices must be of the manual reset type.
            
            
              § 63.25-7
              Exhaust gas boilers.
              (a) Construction. An auxiliary exhaust gas boiler must meet the applicable construction requirements of part 52 or part 53 of this chapter as determined from § 54.01-5, Table 54.01-5(A) of this chapter.
              (b) Controls. Each drum type exhaust gas steam boiler must have a feed water control system. The system must automatically supply the required amount of feed water and maintain it at the proper level. For boilers without a fixed water level, the control system must supply the feed water at a rate sufficient to ensure proper heat transfer. The system must adequately fill the boiler when cold.
              (c) Alarms. When a condition arises which results in inadequate heat transfer, a high temperature alarm or low flow alarm must be activated. An audible alarm must automatically sound, and a visual indicator must indicate when the fluid temperature exceeds the maximum operating temperature or when the fluid/steam flowing through the heat exchanger is insufficient to ensure proper heat transfer. Additionally, an audible alarm must automatically sound, and a visual indicator must indicate when a soot fire is present in the exhaust gas boiler's uptake.

Pursuant to extraordinary legislation at 46 U.S.C. 12118 (Bowater Amendment) and 46 U.S.C. 12117 (Oil Pollution Act of 1990), Certificates of Documentation with limited endorsements may be issued in accordance with part 68 of this chapter to vessels owned by certain persons who are not citizens as defined in this part.

              § 67.31
              Stock or equity interest requirements.
              (a) The stock or equity interest requirements for citizenship under this subpart encompass: title to all classes of stock; title to voting stock; and ownership of equity. An otherwise qualifying corporation or partnership may fail to meet stock or equity interest requirements because: Stock is subject to trust or fiduciary obligations in favor of non-citizens; non-citizens exercise, directly or indirectly, voting power; or non-citizens, by any means, exercise control over the entity. The applicable stock or equity interest requirement is not met if the amount of stock subject to obligations in favor of non-citizens, non-citizen voting power, or non-citizen control exceeds the percentage of the non-citizen interest permitted.
              (b) For the purpose of stock or equity interest requirements for citizenship under this subpart, control of non-fishing industry vessels includes an absolute right to: Direct corporate or partnership business; limit the actions of or replace the chief executive officer, a majority of the board of directors, or any general partner; direct the transfer or operations of any vessel owned by the corporation or partnership; or otherwise exercise authority over the business of the corporation or partnership. Control does not include the right to simply participate in these activities or the right to receive a financial return, e.g., interest or the equivalent of interest on a loan or other financing obligations.
              (c) For the purpose of this section, control of a fishing industry vessel means having:
              (1) The right to direct the business of the entity that owns the vessel;

              Title to a vessel may be established through one of the following methods:
              (a) Simplified method without evidence of build. The owner must produce a copy of the last registration of the vessel (State, Federal, or foreign) and evidence which establishes chain of title from that registration to the present owner.
              
              (b) Simplified method with evidence of build. The owner must produce a copy of the last registration of the vessel (State, Federal, or foreign) and evidence which establishes chain of title from that registration to the present owner along with evidence of the facts of build in accordance with subpart F of this part.
              (c) Complete chain of title, without evidence of citizenship for each entity in that chain of title. The owner must provide evidence which establishes:
              (1) The facts of build in accordance with subpart F of this part; and
              (2) A complete chain of title for the vessel from the person for whom the vessel was built to the present owner.
              (d) Complete chain of title, with evidence of citizenship for each entity in that chain of title. The owner must provide evidence which establishes:
              (1) The facts of build in accordance with subpart F of this part; and
              (2) A complete chain of title for the vessel from the person for whom the vessel was built to the present owner, accompanied by competent and persuasive evidence establishing the citizenship of each entity in the chain of title.
            
            
              § 67.55
              Requirement for removal from foreign registry.
              The owner of a vessel must present evidence of removal of the vessel from foreign registry whenever:
              (a) The owner applies for initial documentation of a vessel that has at any time been registered under the laws of a foreign country; or
              (b) The owner applies for reentry into documentation of a vessel that had been registered under the laws of a foreign country since it was last documented under the laws of the United States.
            
            
              § 67.57
              Extent of title evidence required for initial documentation.
              (a) Vessels never registered under any system:
              (1) Where a coastwise endorsement is sought, the only title evidence required for a vessel being documented by the owner for whom it was built is the certification of the builder (form CG-1261) described in § 67.99. Any other applicant must present title evidence in accordance with § 67.53(d).
              (2) Where a fishery endorsement is sought, the only title evidence required for a vessel being documented by the owner for whom it was built is the certification of the builder (form CG-1261) described in § 67.99. Any other applicant must present title evidence in accordance with either paragraph (c) or (d) of § 67.53.

              (3) Where a registry or recreational endorsement is sought, the only title evidence required for a vessel being documented by the first owner of the vessel is the certification of the builder (form CG-1261) described in § 67.99, or a Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin. Any other applicant must also present title evidence in accordance with either paragraph (c)(2) or (d)(2) of § 67.53.
              
              
                Note:
                Manufacturer's Certificates of Origin are sometimes used as shipping documents for vessels, and may recite as the first owner a person other than the person for which the vessel was built. Therefore, a chain of title which begins with a Certificate of Origin will be deemed incomplete.
              
              
              (b) Vessels previously registered under the laws of a State or a foreign government:
              (1) Where a coastwise endorsement is sought, title evidence must be presented in accordance with § 67.53(d).
              (2) Where a fishery endorsement is sought, title evidence must be presented in accordance with paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of § 67.53.
              (3) Where a registry or recreational endorsement is sought, title evidence must be presented in accordance with paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of § 67.53.

              (a) Title evidence in accordance with subpart E of this part to reflect all ownership changes subsequent to the last issuance of a Certificate of Documentation; and

              (b) Where a registry, fishery, or recreational endorsement is sought, evidence of the citizenship of all owners subsequent to the last owner for whom the vessel was documented except for a vessel:
              (1) Identified in § 67.11(b); or

              (b) When a vessel is returned to documentation after having been under foreign registry, the owner must provide a copy of the last foreign registry, the evidence of removal from foreign registry required by § 67.55, and evidence establishing the complete chain of title from the last owner under foreign registry. No citizenship evidence need be provided for owners in that chain of title.

              (c) The owner of a vessel identified in § 67.11(b) or for which the Maritime Administration has granted approval for transfer or sale, either by written order or by general approval in 46 CFR part 221, and which was under a State or Federal registration or titling system, must provide a copy of the last registration or title, the evidence of removal from foreign registry required by § 67.55, if applicable, and evidence establishing the complete chain of title from the last owner under such registry or title. No citizenship evidence need be provided for owners in that chain of title.
              
              
                Note:
                Although vessels returned to documentation without a complete chain of title are not eligible for a coastwise endorsement, this does not preclude such an endorsement if the chain of title, with citizenship evidence, is completed at a later date.

              (a) In the case of a captured or forfeited vessel, the owner must provide evidence establishing the chain of title from the judicial decree of capture or decree of forfeiture, or the evidence of administrative forfeiture described in § 67.131(b). Citizenship evidence for all owners in the chain of title is required only if a coastwise endorsement is sought.
              (b) In the case of a vessel which is the subject of special legislation or a wrecked vessel, the owner must provide:
              (1) For initial documentation of a vessel or return to documentation of a vessel deleted from documentation, a copy of the last Federal, State, or foreign registration, the evidence of removal from foreign registry required by § 67.55, if applicable, and evidence establishing the chain of title from the last registration. If a coastwise endorsement is sought, the owner must present citizenship evidence for all owners in the chain of title from the grant of special legislation or the determination by the Director, National Vessel Documentation Center that the vessel is eligible for documentation under 46 U.S.C. 12107.

              Application for new vessel determination.
              (a) When a vessel has been constructed entirely of new materials, no application for a new vessel determination need be made under this section. Application for initial documentation must be made in accordance with subpart K of this part.
              (b) When parts of an existing vessel have been used in the construction of a vessel and the owner wants a determination that the resulting vessel is new in accordance with this part, the owner must file with the Director, National Vessel Documentation Center;
              (1) A builder's certification, as described in § 67.99;
              (2) A written statement describing the extent to which materials from the existing vessel were used in the construction and the extent to which those materials were torn down; and
              (3) Accurate sketches or blueprints of the hull and superstructure which must identify, where practicable, components of the old vessel.

              § 67.177
              Application for foreign rebuilding determination.

              A vessel is deemed rebuilt foreign when any considerable part of its hull or superstructure is built upon or substantially altered outside of the United States. In determining whether a vessel is rebuilt foreign, the following parameters apply:
              
              (a) Regardless of its material of construction, a vessel is deemed rebuilt when a major component of the hull or superstructure not built in the United States is added to the vessel.
              (b) For a vessel of which the hull and superstructure is constructed of steel or aluminum—
              (1) A vessel is deemed rebuilt when work performed on its hull or superstructure constitutes more than 10 percent of the vessel's steelweight, prior to the work, also known as discounted lightship weight.
              (2) A vessel may be considered rebuilt when work performed on its hull or superstructure constitutes more than 7.5 percent but not more than 10 percent of the vessel's steelweight prior to the work.
              (3) A vessel is not considered rebuilt when work performed on its hull or superstructure constitutes 7.5 percent or less of the vessel's steelweight prior to the work.
              (c) For a vessel of which the hull and superstructure is constructed of material other than steel or aluminum—
              (1) A vessel is deemed rebuilt when work performed on its hull or superstructure constitutes a quantum of work determined, to the maximum extent practicable, to be comparable to more than 10 percent of the vessel's steelweight prior to the work, calculated as if the vessel were wholly constructed of steel or aluminum.
              (2) A vessel may be considered rebuilt when work performed on its hull or superstructure constitutes a quantum of work determined, to the maximum extent practicable, to be comparable to more than 7.5 percent but not more than 10 percent of the vessel's steelweight prior to the work, calculated as if the vessel were wholly constructed of steel or aluminum.
              (3) A vessel is not considered rebuilt when work performed on its hull or superstructure constitutes a quantum of work determined, to the maximum extent practicable, to be comparable to 7.5 percent or less of the vessel's steelweight prior to the work, calculated as if the vessel were wholly constructed of steel or aluminum.
              (d) For a vessel of mixed construction, such as a vessel the hull of which is constructed of steel or aluminum and the superstructure of which is constructed of fibrous reinforced plastic, the steelweight of the work performed on the portion of the vessel constructed of a material other than steel or aluminum will be determined, to the maximum extent practicable, and aggregated with the work performed on the portion of the vessel constructed of steel or aluminum. The numerical parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section will then be applied to the aggregate of the work performed on the vessel compared to the vessel's steelweight prior to the work, calculated as if the vessel were wholly constructed of steel or aluminum, to determine whether the vessel has been rebuilt.
              (e) The owner of a vessel currently entitled to coastwise or fisheries endorsements which is altered outside the United States and the work performed is determined to constitute or be comparable to more than 7.5 percent of the vessel's steelweight prior to the work, or which has a major component of the hull or superstructure not built in the United States added, must file the following information with the National Vessel Documentation Center within 30 days following the earlier of completion of the work or redelivery of the vessel to the owner or owner's representative:
              (1) A written statement applying for a rebuilt determination, outlining in detail the work performed and naming the place(s) where the work was performed;
              (2) Calculations showing the actual or comparable steelweight of the work performed on the vessel, the actual or comparable steelweight of the vessel, and comparing the actual or comparable steelweight of the work performed to the actual or comparable steelweight of the vessel;
              (3) Accurate sketches or blueprints describing the work performed; and
              (4) Any further submissions requested by the National Vessel Documentation Center.

              (f) Regardless of the extent of actual work performed, the owner of a vessel currently entitled to coastwise or fisheries endorsements may, as an alternative to filing the items listed in paragraph (e) of this section, submit a written statement to the National Vessel Documentation Center declaring the vessel rebuilt outside the United States. The vessel will then be deemed to have been rebuilt outside the United States with loss of trading privileges.
              (g) A vessel owner may apply for a preliminary rebuilt determination by submitting:
              (1) A written statement applying for a preliminary rebuilt determination, outlining in detail the work planned and naming the place(s) where the work is to be performed;
              (2) Calculations showing the actual or comparable steelweight of work to be performed on the vessel, the actual or comparable steelweight of the vessel, and comparing the actual or comparable steelweight of the planned work to the actual or comparable steelweight of the vessel;
              (3) Accurate sketches or blueprints describing the planned work; and

              (4) Any further submissions requested by the National Vessel Documentation Center.
              
              
                Note:
                A statement submitted in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section does not constitute an application for a rebuilt determination and does not require payment of a fee.

                Register ton means a unit of volume equal to 100 cubic feet.
              
                Regulatory Measurement System means the measurement system that comprises subparts C, D, and E of this part (Standard, Dual, and Simplified Regulatory Measurement Systems, respectively), and is sometimes referred to as the national measurement system of the United States. Tonnages assigned under this system are expressed in terms of gross register tons (GRT) or net register tons (NRT).
              
                Remeasurement means the process by which tonnages or registered dimensions of a vessel that was previously measured are assigned or reassigned to that vessel, or are verified to be correct, as appropriate. This includes assignment of tonnages or registered dimensions under a different measurement system.
              
                Self-propelled vessel means a vessel with a means of self-propulsion, including sails.
              
                Simplified Regulatory Measurement System means the measurement system under subpart E of this part, which is one of three sub-systems of the Regulatory Measurement System. It is based on the rules of the Standard Regulatory Measurement System but employs a simplified computational method using hull dimensions as the principal inputs. Tonnages assigned under this system are expressed in terms of gross register tons (GRT) or net register tons (NRT).
              
                Standard Regulatory Measurement System means the measurement system under subpart C of this part, which is one of three sub-systems of the Regulatory Measurement System. This Formal Measurement System is based on the rules of the British Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 and uses volumes of internal spaces as the principal inputs for tonnage calculations, allowing for exemptions or deductions of qualifying spaces according to their location and use. Tonnages assigned under this system are expressed in terms of gross register tons (GRT) or net register tons (NRT).
              
                Tonnage means the volume of a vessel's spaces, including portable enclosed spaces, as calculated under a measurement system in this part, and is categorized as either gross or net. Gross tonnage refers to the volumetric measure of the overall size of a vessel. Net tonnage refers to the volumetric measure of the useful capacity of the vessel. Deck cargo is not included in tonnage.
              
                Tonnage threshold means a delimitating tonnage value specified in an international convention or a Federal statute or regulation.

              Remeasurement.

              (a) If a vessel that is already measured is to undergo a structural alteration, a change to its service, or if the use of its space is to be changed, a remeasurement may be required. For vessels measured under a Formal Measurement System, owners must report immediately to an authorized measurement organization any intent to structurally alter the vessel or to change its service or the use of its space. The measurement organization advises the owner if remeasurement is necessary. For all other vessels, owners must report the intent to structurally alter the vessel to Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center (MSC-4), for a remeasurement determination. Remeasurement is initiated by completing and submitting, where applicable, the appropriate application for measurement services. Spaces not affected by the alteration or change need not be remeasured.
              (b) Remeasurement must also be performed as follows:
              (1) When there is a perceived error in the application of this part, the vessel owner should contact the responsible measurement organization, or Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center (MSC-4), as appropriate. Remeasurement is performed to the extent necessary to verify and correct the error.
              (2) At the vessel owner's option, to reflect the latest tonnage measurement rules and associated interpretations under this part.
              (c) For vessels measured under a Formal Measurement System, if a remeasurement or adjustment of tonnage is required, the authorized measurement organization will issue a new tonnage certificate. For all other vessels, Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center (MSC-4) will take action, as appropriate.
              (d) A vessel of less than 79 feet in overall length measured under a Formal Measurement System may be remeasured at the owner's request under the Simplified Regulatory Measurement System.

              (a) General. Tonnage thresholds are applied using the vessel's tonnage assigned under this part, and as provided for by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. In general, and except as under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, tonnage thresholds expressed in terms of “gross tonnage,” “gross tonnage ITC,” or “GT ITC” are applied using Convention Measurement System tonnage (if assigned) and thresholds expressed in terms of “gross tons,” “registered gross tons,” or “GRT” are applied using the Regulatory Measurement System tonnage (if assigned). Similarly, in general, and except as under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, tonnage thresholds expressed in terms of “net tonnage,” “net tonnage ITC,” or “NT ITC” are applied using Convention Measurement System tonnage (if assigned) and thresholds expressed in terms of “net tons,” “registered net tons,” or “NRT” are applied using the Regulatory Measurement System tonnage (if assigned).
              (b) Thresholds found in international conventions. Unless otherwise provided for by law, apply tonnage thresholds in international conventions as follows:
              (1) For vessels measured under the Convention Measurement System, apply all tonnage thresholds using Convention Measurement System tonnage, except as provided for under the following international tonnage grandfathering provisions, which may be applied at the option of the vessel owner:
              (i) Under Article 3(2)(d) of the Convention:
              
              (A) For a U.S. flag vessel, this Article allows associated tonnage thresholds in effect on or before July 18, 1994 to be applied, at the vessel owner's option, using Regulatory Measurement System tonnage to a vessel whose keel was laid on or before July 18, 1982, and which did not subsequently undergo alterations resulting in a change in its tonnage of a magnitude deemed by the Commandant to constitute a substantial variation in its tonnage.
              (B) For a foreign flag vessel, this Article allows associated tonnage thresholds in effect on or before July 18, 1994, to be applied, at the vessel owner's option, using the foreign country's national measurement system tonnage to a vessel whose keel was laid on or before July 18, 1982, and which did not subsequently undergo alterations resulting in a change in its tonnage of a magnitude deemed by that country to constitute a substantial variation in its tonnage.
              (ii) Under International Maritime Organization (IMO) Resolutions A.494 (XII) of November 19, 1981 and A.541 (XIII) of November 17, 1983:
              

              (A) For a U.S. flag vessel, these resolutions allow tonnage thresholds in effect on July 18, 1994 to be applied using the gross register tonnage (Regulatory Measurement System), to a vessel whose keel was laid on or after July 18, 1982 but before July 19, 1994, and which did not subsequently undergo alterations resulting in a change substantially affecting its tonnage as deemed by the Commandant.
              (B) For a foreign flag vessel, these resolutions allow tonnage thresholds in effect on July 18, 1994 to be applied, at the vessel owner's option, using the foreign country's national measurement system tonnage, to a vessel whose keel was laid on or after July 18, 1982, but on or before July 18, 1994, and which did not undergo alterations after July 18, 1994 of a magnitude deemed by that country to constitute a substantial variation in its tonnage subject to the provisions of these resolutions.
              (iii) Any other international grandfathering provisions as authorized under appropriate International Maritime Organization instruments to which the United States is a party, or which are otherwise recognized or accepted by the United States.
              (2) For all other vessels, apply all tonnage thresholds using Regulatory Measurement System tonnage.
              (c) Thresholds found in Federal statutes and regulations. Unless otherwise provided for by law, apply tonnage thresholds in Federal statutes and regulations as follows:
              (1) For vessels measured under the Convention Measurement System only, apply all thresholds using Convention Measurement System tonnage.
              (2) For vessels measured under the Regulatory Measurement System only, apply all thresholds using Regulatory Measurement System tonnage.
              (3) For all other vessels, apply thresholds in effect before July 19, 1994 using the vessel's Regulatory Measurement System tonnage, and all other thresholds using the vessel's Convention Measurement System tonnage.
              (d) Alternate tonnage thresholds. 46 U.S.C. 14104 authorizes the Coast Guard to establish tonnage thresholds based on the Convention Measurement System as an alternative to tonnage thresholds based on the Regulatory Measurement System. Although 46 U.S.C. 14104 addresses only thresholds in Federal statutes, it does not preclude establishing alternate tonnage thresholds for Federal regulations that currently specify thresholds that were based on the Regulatory Measurement System, where appropriate.
              (1) If an alternate tonnage threshold is prescribed or authorized by Federal statute or regulation, apply the alternate tonnage threshold using the Convention Measurement System tonnage.
              (2) A vessel regulated under paragraph (d) of this section must not be measured under the Regulatory Measurement System.

              § 69.51
              Purpose.
              This subpart prescribes the requirements for measuring a vessel in order to comply with the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969 (Convention), and 46 U.S.C. chapter 143.
            
            
              § 69.53
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart—
              
                Amidships means the midpoint of the registered length, as “registered length” is defined in this section.
              
                Boundary bulkhead means the bulkhead or partition that separates an enclosed interior space from the surrounding weather. In general, the exterior bulkhead of a deck structure is the boundary bulkhead.
              
                Cargo space means an enclosed space appropriated for the transport of cargo which is to be discharged from the vessel. The term does not include a space which qualifies as an excluded space under § 69.61.
              
                Enclosed space is defined in § 69.59.
              
                Excluded space is defined in § 69.61.
              
                Line of the upper deck means a longitudinal line at the underside of the upper deck or, if that deck is stepped, the longitudinal line of the underside of the lowest portion of that deck parallel with the upper portions of that deck.
              
                Molded depth means the vertical distance amidships between the following points:

              (a) From the line of the upper deck at the vessel's side or, if the vessel has rounded gunwales, from the intersection of the line of the upper deck extended to the molded line of the shell plating as though the gunwales were of angular design.
              
              (b) To the top of the flat keel, to the lower edge of the keel rabbet if the vessel is of wood or composite structure, or to the point where the line of the flat of the bottom extended inward cuts the side of the keel if the vessel's lower part is hollow or has thick garboards.
              
                Molded draft means—
              (a) For vessels assigned a load line under parts 42, 44, 45, or 47 of this chapter, the draft corresponding to the Summer Load Line (other than a timber load line);
              (b) For passenger vessels assigned a load line under part 46 of this chapter, the draft corresponding to the deepest subdivision load line assigned;
              (c) For vessels to which parts 42, 44, 45, 46, or 47 of this chapter do not apply but which otherwise have been assigned a load line, the draft corresponding to the Summer Load Line so assigned;
              (d) For vessels to which no load line has been assigned but the draft of which is restricted under any Coast Guard requirement, the maximum draft permitted under the restriction; and
              (e) For other vessels, 75 per cent of the molded depth.
              
                Passenger means a person on board a vessel other than—
              (a) The master, a member of the crew, or other person employed or engaged in any capacity in the business of the vessel; and
              (b) A child under one year of age.
              
                Registered breadth means the maximum breadth of a vessel measured amidships to the molded line of the frame in a vessel with a metal shell and to the outer surface of the hull in all other vessels.
              
                Registered length means either 96 percent of the length on a waterline at 85 percent of the least molded depth measured from the top of the flat keel or the length from the fore side of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, whichever is greater. In vessels designed with a rake of keel, this length is measured on a waterline parallel to the design waterline.
              
                Upper deck means the uppermost complete deck exposed to weather and sea, which has permanent means of weathertight closing of all openings in the weather part of the deck, and below which all openings in the sides of the vessel are fitted with permanent means of watertight closing.
              
                Weathertight means secure against penetration of water into the vessel in any sea condition.

              Enclosed spaces.
              
                Enclosed space means a space which is bounded by the vessel's hull, by fixed or portable partitions or bulkheads, or by decks or coverings other than permanent or movable awnings. No break in a deck, nor any opening in the vessel's hull, in a deck or in a covering of a space, or in the partitions or bulkheads of a space, nor the absence of a partition or bulkhead precludes the space from being included in the enclosed space. Portable enclosed spaces, regardless of method of attachment to the vessel, are treated as enclosed spaces as defined in this paragraph.
              [CGD 87-015b, 54 FR 37657, Sept. 12, 1989, as amended by USCG-2011-0522, 81 FR 18721, Mar. 31, 2016]
            
            
              § 69.61
              Excluded spaces.
              (a) Excluded space means an enclosed space which is excluded from the total volume of all enclosed spaces (V) in calculating gross tonnage ITC. Spaces that are below the upper deck and open to the sea, as well as those spaces listed in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, are excluded spaces, except as under paragraph (g) of this section.
              (b) A space that is within a structure and that is opposite an end opening extending from deck to deck (except for a curtain plate of a height not exceeding by more than one inch the depth of the adjoining deck beams) and having a breadth equal to or greater than 90 percent of the breadth of the deck at the line of the opening is an excluded space, subject to the following:
              (1) Only the space between the actual end opening and a line drawn parallel to the line or face of the opening at a distance from the opening equal to one-half of the breadth of the deck at the line of the opening is excluded. (See § 69.75, figure 1.)
              (2) If, because of any arrangement (except convergence of the outside plating as shown in § 69.75, figure 3), the breadth of the space is less than 90 percent of the breadth of the deck, only the space between the line of the opening and a parallel line drawn through the point where the athwartship breadth of the space is equal to 90 percent or less of the breadth of the deck is excluded. (See § 69.75, figures 2 and 4.)
              (3) When any two spaces, either of which is excluded under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, are separated by an area that is completely open except for bulwarks or open rails, these two spaces must not be excluded if the separation between the two spaces is less than the least half breadth of the deck in way of the separation. (See § 69.75, figures 5 and 6.)
              (4) When the deck at the line of an opening has rounded gunwales, the breadth of the deck is the distance between the tangent points indicated in § 69.75, figure 11.
              (c) A space that is open to the weather and that is under an overhead deck covering with no connection on the space's exposed sides between the covering and the deck other than the stanchions necessary for the covering's support is an excluded space. An open rail or bulwark fitted at the vessel's side does not disqualify the space from being an excluded space if the height between the top of the rail or bulwark and the overhead structure or curtain plate (if fitted) is not less than 2.5 feet or one-third of the height of the space, whichever is greater. (See § 69.75, figure 7.)
              (d) A space in a side-to-side structure directly in way of opposite side openings not less than 2.5 feet in height or one-third of the height of the structure, whichever is greater, is an excluded space. If the opening is only on one side of the structure, the space to be excluded is limited inboard from the opening to a maximum of one-half of the breadth of the deck in way of the opening. (See § 69.75, figure 8.)
              (e) A space in a structure immediately below an uncovered opening in the deck overhead is an excluded space, if the opening is exposed to the weather and the space to be excluded is limited to the area of the opening. (See § 69.75, figure 9.)
              (f) A recess in the boundary bulkhead of a structure which is exposed to the weather and which has an opening that extends from deck to deck without a means of closing is an excluded space, if the interior width of the space is not greater than the width of the opening and extension of the space into the structure is not greater than twice the width of the opening. (See § 69.75, figure 10.)
              (g) Any space described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section which fulfills at least one of the following conditions is not an excluded space:

              (1) The space is fitted with shelves or other means designed for securing cargo or stores.
              
              (2) The opening that would otherwise permit the space to be excluded space is fitted with a means of closure.
              (3) Other features of the space make it possible for the space to be closed.

              Tonnage certificates.
              (a) On request of the vessel owner, the authorized measurement organization must issue an International Tonnage Certificate (1969) as evidence of the vessel's measurement under this subpart for a vessel that is 24 meters (79.0 feet) or more in registered length, will engage on a foreign voyage, and is not a vessel of war. The Certificate is delivered to the vessel owner or master and must be maintained on board the vessel when it is engaged on a foreign voyage. For a vessel for which a remeasurement under § 69.71 resulted in a net tonnage ITC decrease due to changes other than alterations or modifications to the vessel deemed by the Commandant to be of a major character, an International Tonnage Certificate (1969) reflecting the decreased net tonnage ITC will not be reissued until 12 months have elapsed from the date of measurement indicated on the current certificate.
              (b) If an International Tonnage Certificate (1969) is not issued for a vessel measured under this part, the measurement organization must issue a U.S. Tonnage Certificate as evidence of the vessel's measurement under this subpart, which must also indicate the vessel's measurement under any other subpart of this part. There is no requirement to maintain the U.S. Tonnage Certificate on board the vessel.
              (c) For a vessel that transfers flag to a foreign country that is party to the Convention, the International Tonnage Certificate (1969) remains valid for a period not to exceed 3 months after the flag transfer, or until an International Tonnage Certificate (1969) is issued under authority of the foreign country to replace it, whichever is earlier.

              (a) When a vessel is altered so that the net tonnage is increased, the new net tonnage must be applied immediately.
              (b) A vessel concurrently assigned load lines under both the International Convention on Load Lines and either the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) or other international agreement must be assigned only one net tonnage. The net tonnage assigned must be the net tonnage applicable to the load line assigned under the International Convention on Load Lines, SOLAS or other international agreement for the trade in which the vessel in engaged.
              (c) When a vessel is altered so that the net tonnage is decreased or the vessel's trade is changed so that the load line assigned for that trade under paragraph (b) of this section is no longer appropriate and results in a decrease in its net tonnage, a new International Tonnage Certificate (1969) incorporating that net tonnage may not be issued until twelve months after the date on which the current Certificate was issued. However, if one of the following apply, a new Certificate may be issued immediately:
              (1) The vessel is transferred to the flag of another nation.
              (2) The vessel undergoes alterations or modifications which the Commandant deems to be of a major character, such as the removal of a superstructure which requires an alteration of the assigned load line.

                Step means a cutoff in a deck or in the bottom, top, or sides of a space resulting in varying heights of a deck or varying heights or widths of a space.
              
                Superstructure means all permanently closed-in structures, including all portable enclosed spaces, on or above the line of the uppermost complete deck or, if the vessel has a shelter deck, on or above the line of the shelter deck. Examples of superstructure spaces include forecastles, bridges, poops, deckhouses, breaks, portable tanks, and modular quarters units.
              
                Tonnage deck is defined in § 69.109(c).
              
              
                Tonnage interval means the longitudinal distance between transverse sections of a vessel's under-deck, between-deck, or superstructure when divided into an even number of equal parts for purposes of volume integration.

              (a) Defined. “Uppermost complete deck” means the uppermost deck which extends from stem to stern and from side to side at all points of its length and is bound by the vessel's hull.
              (b) Restrictions. The uppermost complete deck must not:
              (1) Extend above any space exempted as open space under paragraph (d) of § 69.117;
              (2) Extend below the design waterline, except in the case of vessels such as submersibles, where the entire uppermost complete deck is submerged during normal operations; or

              (3) Rest directly on consecutive or alternating ordinary bottom frames or floors for a distance of over one-half of the tonnage length.
              (c) Deck discontinuities. Decking athwartships of the following deck discontinuities is not considered to be part of the uppermost complete deck:
              (1) Through-deck openings that are not protected from the sea and the weather, such as would be provided by hatch covers or a surrounding superstructure that encloses the opening and whose area is more than 10 percent of the total deck area from stem to stern as viewed from above.
              (2) Middle line openings conforming to the requirements of § 69.117(e)(2).
              (3) Deck recesses that are not through-hull for which the depth of the deck recess at its deepest point is more than five feet below adjacent portions of the deck, and whose area (as viewed from above) is more than 10 percent of the total deck area from stem to stern, as viewed from above.
              (4) Notches bounded by a deck below that wrap around from the ends to the sides of the vessel for which the depth at the deepest point is more than five feet below adjacent portions of the deck, the area is more than one percent of the total deck area from stem to stern as viewed from above, the length of the notch in the direction of the vessel's longitudinal axis exceeds 10 feet at any point across its width, and the width of the notch in the direction of the vessel's longitudinal axis exceeds two feet at any point along its length.

              § 69.109
              Under-deck tonnage.
              (a) Defined. “Under-deck tonnage” means the tonnage of the space below the line of the tonnage deck, as that volume is calculated under this section.
              (b) Method of calculating tonnage. Under-deck tonnage is calculated by applying Simpson's first rule using the tonnage length and the areas of the transverse sections prescribed by this section.
              (c) Identifying the tonnage deck. In vessels with two or less enumerated decks, the tonnage deck is the uppermost complete deck. In vessels with more than two enumerated decks, the tonnage deck is the second enumerated deck from the keel as determined in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (d) Enumerating the decks to identify the second deck from the keel. The uppermost complete deck is an enumerated deck. Decks below the uppermost complete deck that extend from stem to stern and side to side at all points along their lengths are also enumerated, provided they are not disqualified by either of the following deck discontinuities:
              (1) A through-deck opening that is not fitted with a cover (or equivalent) and whose area is more than 10 percent of the total deck area, as viewed from above.
              (2) A deck recess that is not through-hull for which the depth at its deepest point is more than five feet below adjacent portions of the deck and whose area as viewed from above is more than 10 percent of the total deck area from stem to stern, as viewed from above.
              (e) Identifying the line of the tonnage deck. (1) If the tonnage deck runs in a continuous line from stem to stern, the line of the tonnage deck is the longitudinal line at the underside of the tonnage deck.
              (2) If the tonnage deck is stepped, the line of the tonnage deck is the longitudinal line of the underside of the lowest portion of that deck parallel with the upper portions of that deck. Steps that do not extend from side to side or are less than three feet in length are ignored when establishing the line of the tonnage deck. (See § 69.123, figures 1 and 2.) Spaces between the line of the tonnage deck and the higher portions of that deck are not included in under-deck tonnage.
              (f) Tonnage length. (1) “Tonnage length” means the length of a horizontal straight line measured at the centerline of the vessel from the point forward where the line of the tonnage deck intersects the line of the inboard faces of the ordinary side frames to the point aft where the line of the tonnage deck intersects the inboard face of the ordinary transom frames or cant frames. (See § 69.123, figure 3.)

              (2) For a vessel having a headblock or square end with framing which extends from the tonnage deck to the bottom of the vessel, the tonnage length terminates on the inboard face of the headblock or ordinary end frames. (See § 69.123, figure 4.)
              (3) For a vessel having a square bow or stern and tonnage deck with camber, the effect of the camber on the tonnage length must be considered. The tonnage length must be measured below the tonnage deck at a distance equal to one-third of round camber and one-half of straight pitch camber.
              (4) The forward and after termini of the tonnage length must be a distance of no more than eight and one-half feet from the associated inboard surface of the skin of the hull at the bow and stern as measured at the centerline of the vessel, and the after terminus must not be forward of the centerline of the rudderstock.
              (g) Division of vessel into transverse sections. (1) Except as under paragraph (m)(1)(iii) of this section, the tonnage length is divided into an even number of equal parts as indicated in the following table:

              (2) Transverse sections are cut at each end of the tonnage length and at each point of division of the tonnage length, whose location is referred to as a tonnage station, and assigned sequential tonnage station numbers, beginning at the stem. Intervals and one-third intervals between the points of division are measured to the nearest thousandth of a foot. (See § 69.123 figures 5 and 6.)
              (h) Depths of transverse sections. (1) Transverse section depths are measured at each point of division of the tonnage length at the centerline of the vessel from a point below the line of the tonnage deck equal to one-third of the camber or to one-half of the pitch of the beam down to the upper side of the ordinary frames, floors, longitudinals, or tank top of a double bottom for water ballast, as the case may be.
              (2) When a depth falls at a point where the tank top of a double bottom for water ballast has a straight fall from centerline to the wings, the depth terminates at one-half of the height of fall. (See § 69.123 figure 8.)
              (3) When a depth falls at a point where the tank top of a double bottom for water ballast rises from the centerline to the wings, the depth terminates at one-half the dead rise. (See § 69.123, figure 9.)
              (4) The depth at the midpoint of the tonnage length or, when a vessel is measured in parts, the depth at the midpoint of each part determines the number of equal parts into which each depth is divided, as follows:
              (i) If the midpoint depth is 16 feet or less, each depth is divided into four equal parts. If the midpoint depth exceeds 16 feet, each depth is divided into six equal parts. (See § 69.123, figure 7.)
              (ii) The interval between the points of division of a depth and one-third intervals are carried to the nearest hundredth of a foot.
              (i) Breadths of transverse sections. (1) Transverse section breadths are measured horizontally at each point of division of each depth and also at the upper and lower points of each depth. Breadths are measured to the inboard face of the ordinary frames or to the line of the ordinary frames. Breadths are measured parallel to each other and at right angle to the vessel's centerline. (See § 69.123, figure 7.)
              (2) Upper breadths are not reduced by measuring to deck-beam brackets. In cases of camber when an upper breadth passes through the deck (see § 69.123, figure 7), the breadth is measured to the line of the side frames at the under side of the deck projected vertically up to the height of the upper breadth.

              (3) Bottom breadths are measured only as far as the flat of the floor extends. (See § 69.123, figures 7 and 10.) When bottom frames rise immediately from the flat keel, bottom breadths are equal to the breadth of the flat keel. Where there is no double bottom for water ballast and where there is dead rise of the bottom out to the sides of the vessel, bottom breadths are equal to the part of the bottom plating not affected by dead rise.
              
              (4) Bottom breadths falling in way of a double bottom, the top of which rises or falls from centerline to the wings, are measured between the inboard faces of the frame brackets which connect the double bottom with the frames. (See § 69.123, figures 8 and 9.)
              (j) Measuring spaces having ceiling. The maximum allowance for terminating measurements on ceiling is three inches on the bottom frames or tank top and three inches on each side frame. When ceiling is less than three inches thick, only the actual thickness is allowed. When ceiling is fitted on a platform directly above the bottom frames, depths are measured down through the platform to the upper side of the frames and the allowable ceiling on the platform is then deducted.
              (k) Area of transverse sections. (1) A transverse section at an end of the tonnage length may not yield area, except in vessels (such as barges) with an upright bow or stern.
              (2) The breadths of each transverse section are numbered from above, the upper being “1”, the second down being “2”, and so on to the lowest.
              (3) Multiply the even numbered breadths by four and the odd numbered breadths by two, except for the first and last breadths, which are multiplied by one.
              (4) Add together the products from paragraph (k)(3) of this section.
              (5) Multiply the sum from paragraph (k)(4) of this section by one-third of the interval between the breadths. The product is the area of the transverse section.
              (l) Tonnage. (1) Number the transverse sections successively “1”, “2”, and so forth, beginning at the bow.
              (2) Multiply the area of the even numbered sections by four and the area of the odd numbered sections by two, except the first and last sections, which are multiplied by one.
              (3) Add together the products from paragraph (l)(2) of this section and multiply the sum by one-third of the interval between the sections. The product is the volume under-deck.
              (4) The volume under-deck is divided by 100 and is, subject to exemptions, the under-deck tonnage.
              (m) Steps in double bottom for water ballast. (1) The tonnage length of a vessel having a step exceeding six inches in height in its double bottom for water ballast is divided into longitudinal parts at the step. Each part is subdivided as follows to determine the number of transverse sections:
              (i) Parts 20 feet or under in length are divided into two equal parts.
              (ii) Parts over 20 feet and under 40 feet in length are divided into four equal parts.
              (iii) Parts 40 feet or over are divided as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
              (2) The tonnage of each part is calculated separately. The sum of the tonnages of the parts is the under-deck tonnage.
              (n) Spaces open to the sea. In calculating the tonnage of spaces below the uppermost complete deck, subtract from each breadth measurement the portion of that measurement that spans a space, or a portion thereof, that is open to the sea.
              (o) Open vessels. (1) An open vessel is a vessel without an uppermost complete deck.
              (2) The line of the tonnage deck for an open vessel is the upper edge of the upper strake. Depths of transverse sections are taken from this line.
              (3) Any vessel, other than one having a mechanically refrigerated hold, that is not an open vessel and that has a tonnage length of less than 50 feet is measured as an open vessel, if the distance between the line of its tonnage deck and the upper edge of the upper strake is more than one-sixth of the midship depth. “Midship depth” means the depth measured from the line of the upper edge of the upper strake to the point in the bottom used for measuring tonnage depths.
              (p) General requirements on ordinary frames—(1) Construction. An ordinary frame must not be penetrated by an intersecting frame used to strengthen the vessel's hull, except in a vessel of wooden construction. Ordinary frames must be of the same material, or have the same material properties, as the adjacent hull, and attach to the adjacent hull to at least the same extent as adjacent ordinary and normal frames. If comprised of different elements, the elements must be joined to each other to the same extent that the frame is joined to the hull. The frame, or portions thereof, not meeting these requirements must be treated as if not there when establishing the line of the ordinary frames.
              (2) Frame spacing and extension. Ordinary frames used to establish the line of the ordinary frames must be spaced on centers that are a maximum of four feet apart. These frames must extend for a length of at least one tonnage interval that begins at, ends at, or crosses the associated tonnage station. For a longitudinally-framed vessel, the frames must begin and end at a transverse ordinary frame or at the vessel's hull.
              (3) Different sized framing. When an ordinary frame has a different depth of frame than an adjacent ordinary frame, the line of the ordinary frames is established using the set of alternating frames that yields the smallest sectional area at the associated tonnage station, with the sectional area based on the frame with the smallest depth of frame in the chosen alternating set.
              (4) Frame openings. If an opening in an ordinary frame is oversized, or is penetrated by a frame other than an ordinary frame, the line of the ordinary frames is established as if the frame material above and inboard of the opening is not there. Similarly, frame material separating adjacent openings that are within the longest linear dimension of either opening must be treated as if not there when establishing the line of the ordinary frames. An opening is oversized if the opening is:
              (i) Circular in shape with a diameter exceeding 18 inches;

              (ii) Oval in shape of a size greater than 15 × 23 inches (i.e., either the minor axis exceeds 15 inches or the major axis exceeds 23 inches, and the oval's area exceeds 255 square inches (345 square inches in a fuel tank)); or
              (iii) Any shape other than circular or oval, whose area exceeds 255 square inches (345 square inches in a fuel tank).
              (5) Asymmetrical framing. Where ordinary frames are configured such that the line of the ordinary frames would be asymmetrical about the centerline of the vessel, breadth measurements are determined by taking half-breadths on the side of the vessel that yields the greatest sectional area at the associated tonnage station, and multiplying those half-breadths by a factor of two to yield the full breadths.

              § 69.111
              Between-deck tonnage.
              (a) Defined. “Between-deck tonnage” means the tonnage of the space above the line of the tonnage deck and below the line of the uppermost complete deck.
              (b) Identifying the line of the uppermost complete deck. (1) If the uppermost complete deck runs in a continuous line from stem to stern, the line of the uppermost complete deck is the longitudinal line of the underside of the uppermost complete deck.
              (2) If the uppermost complete deck is stepped, the line of the uppermost complete deck is the longitudinal line of the underside of the lowest portion of that deck parallel with the upper portions of that deck. Steps that do not extend from side to side or are less than three feet in length are ignored when establishing the line of the uppermost complete deck. Spaces between the line of the uppermost complete deck and the higher portions of the deck are included in superstructure tonnage.
              (c) Method for calculating tonnage. The tonnage of each level of the between-deck space is calculated separately, as follows:
              (1) The length of each level is measured at the mid-height between the line of the deck above and the line of the deck below. Measure from the point forward where the continuation of the line of the normal frames intersects the center line of the vessel aft to the forward face of the normal transom framing.
              (2) Divide the length under paragraph (c)(1) of this section into the same number of equal parts into which the tonnage length is divided under § 69.109(g)(1).

              (3) Measure at mid-height the inside breadth of the space to the line of the normal frames at each end and at each point of division of the length. Number the breadths successively “1”, “2”, and so forth beginning at the bow.
              (4) Multiply the even numbered breadths by four and the odd numbered breadths by two, except the first and last, which are multiplied by one.
              (5) Add together the products under paragraph (c)(4) of this section and multiply the sum by one-third of the interval between the points at which the breadths are taken. The product is the square foot area of the space at mid-height.
              (6) Multiply the area of the space at mid-height by the average of the heights taken each point of division of the space. The product divided by 100 is the tonnage of that space.
              (7) The between-deck tonnage is the sum of the tonnage of each level within the between-deck space.

              § 69.113
              Superstructure tonnage.
              (a) Defined. “Superstructure tonnage” means the tonnage of all superstructure spaces.
              (b) Method of calculating tonnage. The tonnage of all structures on each level on or above the uppermost complete deck (or shelter deck, if applicable) is calculated separately as follows:
              (1) Measure the length of each structure along its centerline at mid-height to the line of the normal frames. (See § 69.123, figure 11.)
              (2) Divide the length under paragraph (b)(1) of this section into an even number of equal parts most nearly equal to those into which the tonnage length is divided under § 69.109.
              (3) Measure at mid-height the inside breadth to the line of the normal frames at each end and at each point of division of the length. Number the breadths successively “1”, “2”, and so forth, beginning at the extreme forward end of the structure. If an end of the structure is in the form of a continuous arc or curve, the breadth at that end is one-half the nearest breadth. If an end is in the form of an arc or curve having a decided flat, the breadth at the end is two-thirds of the nearest breadth.
              (4) Multiply the even numbered breadths by four and the odd numbered by two, except the first and last breadth, which are multiplied by one.
              (5) Add together the products under paragraph (b)(4) of this section and multiply the sum by one-third of the interval between the points at which the breadths are taken. The product is the square foot area of the structure at mid-height.
              (6) Multiply this area by the average of the heights taken at each point of division of the structure between its decks or the line of its decks. The product divided by 100 is the tonnage of that structure.
              (c) A structure having steps in its deck or side must be measured in parts.
              (d) The superstructure tonnage is the sum of tonnages of each level above the line of the uppermost complete deck (or shelter deck, if applicable).
              (e) When a structure is located over a cut-away portion of the tonnage deck, the structure's height is measured from the under side of its overhead deck to the line of the tonnage deck. If the tonnage deck has no camber, allow for camber in the overhead deck.
              (f) For structures of a standard geometric shape, a simple geometric formula that yields an accurate volume may be used. All measurements are terminated at the line of the normal frames.

              § 69.115
              Excess hatchway tonnage.
              (a) Hatchways that are above the tonnage deck and are either open to the weather or within open structures are measured to determine excess hatchway tonnage. Hatchways that are in between-deck spaces, on decks within closed-in structures, or on open structures are not measured.
              (b) The tonnage of a hatchway is its length times breadth times mean depth divided by 100. Mean depth is measured from the under side of the hatch cover to the top of the deck beam.

              (c) From the sum of the tonnage of the hatchways under this section, subtract one-half of one percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage exclusive of the hatchway tonnage. The remainder is added as excess hatchway tonnage in calculating the gross register tonnage.

              § 69.117
              Spaces exempt from inclusion in tonnage.
              (a) Purpose. This section lists spaces which are exempt from inclusion in tonnage.
              (b) Spaces on or above the line of the uppermost complete deck. The following spaces or portions of spaces on or above the line of the uppermost complete deck are exempt if the spaces or portions are reasonable in extent and adapted and used exclusively for the purpose indicated:
              (1) Spaces for anchor gear, including capstan, windlass, and chain locker, are exempt.
              (2) Companions and booby-hatches protecting stairways or ladderways leading to spaces below are exempt, whether or not the spaces below are exempt.
              (3) Galley or other spaces fitted with a range or oven for cooking food to be consumed on board the vessel are exempt.
              (4) Spaces designed to provide light or air to propelling machinery are exempt, as follows:
              (i) When propelling machinery is located entirely on or above the line of the uppermost complete deck, the entire propelling machinery space and all fuel bunker spaces that are also located above that line are exempt as light or air spaces. (See exception in § 69.121(d)(1) for framed-in spaces.)
              (ii) When part of the propelling machinery projects above the line of the uppermost complete deck into a space used exclusively to provide light or air to the propelling machinery, the entire space is exempt as light or air space. When any portion of this space is used for purposes other than providing light or air, only the portion of the space used for light or air, the space occupied by the propelling machinery itself, and a propelling machinery working space allowance under § 69.121 limited to two feet, if available, on each side of the propelling machinery are exempt.
              (iii) Any part of an escape shaft, or a companion sheltering an escape shaft, above the line of the uppermost complete deck is exempt as light or air space.
              (iv) Space that would otherwise be exempt as a light or air space is not exempt when propelling machinery is boxed-in and does not extend above the line of the uppermost complete deck. Any portion of the boxed-in space above the line of the uppermost complete deck is exempt.
              (5) Skylights affording light or air to a space below, other than to propelling machinery spaces. Space immediately below the line of the deck on which a skylight is located is exempt only when there is an opening in the next lower deck directly below the skylight to permit light or air to an even lower deck.
              (6) Machinery spaces, other than for propelling machinery under § 169.121.
              (7) Spaces for steering gear.
              (8) Water closet spaces that are fitted with at least a toilet and are intended for use by more than one person.
              (9) The space in a wheelhouse necessary for controlling the vessel.
              (c) Passenger spaces. (1) As used in this section, the term “passenger” includes officers and enlisted men on military vessels who are not assigned ship's duties and not entered on the ship's articles.
              (2) As used in this section, “passenger space” means a space reserved exclusively for the use of passengers and includes, but is not limited to, berthing areas, staterooms, bathrooms, toilets, libraries, writing rooms, lounges, dining rooms, saloons, smoking rooms, and recreational rooms. The space need not be part of or adjacent to a berthing area to be considered a passenger space. Spaces used by both passengers and crew members (e.g., first aid stations), or used for passenger support but not accessible to passengers at all times (e.g., vaults on a gaming vessel) cannot be exempted as passenger space.

              (3) A passenger space located on, or above the first deck above the uppermost complete deck is exempt from tonnage. To qualify as the first deck above the uppermost complete deck, the deck must be at least six inches above the uppermost complete deck at all points along its length.
              (d) Open structures.(1) Structures that are located on or above the line of the uppermost complete deck that are under cover (sheltered), but open to the weather are exempt from tonnage as open space. The following additional requirements apply:
              (i) If a structure is divided into compartments, only those compartments which are open to the weather are exempt from tonnage under the provisions of this section.
              (ii) Open space cannot progress vertically through openings in a deck within the structure.
              (iii) A space that is outside a structure's boundary bulkhead as defined in § 69.53 is considered open to the weather provided the space is eligible to be treated as an excluded space under the provisions of § 69.61, regardless of whether or not the space is fitted with means designed for securing cargo or stores.
              (2) A structure is considered open to the weather when an exterior end bulkhead of the structure is open and, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4), (5), and (6) of this section, is not fitted with any means of closing. To be considered open to the weather, the end bulkhead must not have a coaming height of more than two feet in way of any required opening nor any permanent obstruction within two and one-half feet of the opening, it must be fitted with a deck or platform that is a minimum of two and one-half feet wide on the exterior side of the opening, and it must have one of the following:
              (i) Two openings, each at least three feet wide and at least four feet high in the clear, one on each side of the centerline of the structure. If the openings lead to two separate interior compartments, there must be circulation of open space between the two compartments via a single such opening, or series of such openings, in the intermediate bulkhead(s).
              (ii) One opening at least four feet wide and at least five feet high in the clear.
              (iii) One opening at least 20 square feet in the clear with a breadth in excess of four feet and a height of not less than three feet.
              (3) A compartment within an open structure is considered open to the weather only when an interior bulkhead of that compartment has an opening or openings that meet the requirements for end bulkheads under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (iii) of this section. Other compartments within the structure are not considered open to the weather. The following additional requirements apply:
              (i) For the interior compartment to be considered open to the weather, any compartment or series of compartments from which the open space progresses must have an opening or openings meeting the requirements for end bulkhead openings, except that the opening(s) need not be located in the forward or after end of the compartment.
              (ii) Open space may not progress from a space that is open under the provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section unless the space may also be considered open under another provision of this section.
              (4) An interior or exterior opening that is temporarily closed by shifting boards dropped into channel sections at the sides of the opening is considered open to the weather if battening, caulking, or gaskets of any material are not used.
              (5) An interior or exterior opening that is temporarily closed by cover plates or boards held in place only by hook bolts (see § 69.123, Figure 12) is considered open to the weather—
              (i) If hook bolts used to secure cover plates or boards are spaced at least one foot apart and hook over a stiffener installed around the perimeter of the opening;
              (ii) If the cover plates or boards fit tightly against the weather side of the bulkhead; and
              (iii) If battening, caulking, or gaskets of any material are not used.
              (6) An interior or exterior opening that is temporarily closed by cover plates or boards held in place only by bolts and crosspieces is considered open to the weather—
              (i) If the bolts are not installed through the bulkhead;

              (ii) If the bolts and crosspieces are not held in place by cleats or other attachments to or through the bulkhead;
              
              (iii) If the cover plates or boards fit tightly against the weather side of the bulkhead; and
              (iv) If battening, caulking, or gaskets of any material are not used.
              (7) Notwithstanding the opening size requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a structure with its aft end entirely open from the under side of its overhead stiffeners down to the deck, to the line of the deck, or to a coaming not exceeding three inches in height and open athwartship between the inboard faces of the side stiffeners is considered open to the weather. The opening may be covered by a wire mesh screen or temporarily closed by canvas secured at the top and lashed or buttoned in place.
              (8) A structure is considered open to the weather if:
              (i) Both sides of the structure are open and not fitted with any means of closing other than temporary covers meeting the requirements of paragraphs (d)(4), (5), and (6) of this section;
              (ii) The openings are directly across from each other, are not separated by a bulkhead or bulkheads, and do not have any permanent obstruction within two and one-half feet of either opening; and
              (iii) The openings have a continuous height of at least three feet, or the full height of the structure, whichever is less, and either extend the full length of the structure or each have an area of 60 square feet.
              (e) Open space between the shelter deck and the uppermost complete deck. (1) Space that is between the shelter deck and the uppermost complete deck and that is under cover (sheltered) but open to the weather is exempt from tonnage when all openings in the uppermost complete deck are provided with a watertight means of closing.
              (2) A space is considered “open to the weather” under paragraph (e)(1) of this section when the shelter deck above the space has a middle line opening which conforms to the following:
              (i) The middle line opening must be at least four feet long in the clear and at least as wide as the after cargo hatch on the shelter deck, but not less than one-half the width of the vessel at the midpoint of the length of the opening. The opening may have rounded corners not exceeding a nine inch radius. When a greater radius is required by the Coast Guard or a Coast Guard recognized classification society under § 42.05-60 of this chapter, notification of that requirement must be submitted to the Commandant.
              (ii) The middle line opening must be located so that the distance between the aft edge of the middle line opening and the vessel's stern is not less than one-twentieth of the tonnage length of the vessel and the distance between the fore edge of the opening and the vessel's stem is not less than one-fifth of the tonnage length of the vessel.
              (iii) The middle line opening must not be within a structure of any type.
              (iv) If the middle line opening is guarded by rails or stanchions, the rails and stanchions must not be used to secure or assist in securing a cover over the opening.
              (v) The coaming of the middle line opening must not exceed one foot mean height above the shelter deck. Bolts must not pass through the stiffeners or flanges on the coaming, nor may there be any other attachments on the coaming for fastening a cover. Portable wood covers may be fitted over the middle line opening if held in place only by lashings fitted to the under side of the covers. Metal covers may be fitted if held in place only by hook bolts spaced not less than 18 inches apart that pass through the cover and hook over angle stiffeners or flanges fitted to the outside of the coaming. Battening, caulking, seals, or gaskets of any material may not be used in association with any middle line opening cover.
              (vi) The space below the middle line opening must have a minimum length of four feet throughout its entire breadth and height and be in the clear at all times.
              (vii) A scupper having a five inch minimum inside diameter and fitted with a screw down non-return valve geared to and operated from the shelter deck must be fitted on each side of the upper deck in way of the middle line opening.

              (3) When the shelter deck space forward or aft of the middle line opening is divided by interior bulkheads, only those compartments with at least two openings that progress to the middle line opening are considered “open to the weather” under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Each required opening must be at least three feet wide and at least four feet high in the clear, must not have a coaming height of more than two feet, and must not be fitted (except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4), (d)(5), and (d)(6) of this section) with any means of closing. Other compartments within the shelter deck space are not considered “open to the weather” under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
              (f) Water ballast spaces. A space, regardless of location, adapted only for water ballast and not available for stores, supplies, fuel, or cargo (other than water to be used for underwater drilling, mining, and related purposes, including production), upon request, may be exempt from tonnage if the following are met:
              (1) The space must be available at all times only for water ballast that is piped through a system independent of other systems (except fire fighting and bilge suction systems). Pumps, pipes, and other equipment for loading and unloading water ballast must be of a size suitable for the efficient handling of the water ballast within a reasonable time frame. All manholes providing access to a water ballast space must be oval or circular and not greater than 34 inches in diameter. Except for those on a deck exposed to the weather, the manholes may have a coaming not exceeding six inches in height. Existing hatches over spaces being converted to water ballast spaces must have a watertight cover plate welded to the hatch and a manhole, as described in this paragraph, fitted in the plating.
              (2) The primary purpose of the water ballast must be to afford a means of maintaining the vessel's stability, immersion, trim, pre-loading conditions, or seakeeping capabilities.
              (3) If the space is in a vessel that is subject to inspection under 46 U.S.C. 3301, the space must be considered when determining the adequacy of the vessel's stability under 46 CFR chapter I.
              (4) If the total of all water ballast spaces to be exempted from tonnage exceeds 30 percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage (as calculated under this subpart without any allowance for water ballast), a justification of the operating conditions that require the water ballast must be submitted to the measuring organization for approval. Although a single condition may justify all water ballast spaces, several conditions may be necessary in other cases. However, a particular tank is not justified by a condition if another tank already justified by another condition could be used as effectively. The justification must—
              (i) Designate the vessel's service;
              (ii) Explain for what purpose under paragraph (f)(2) of this section the water ballast is being used;
              (iii) Include the capacity, tank arrangement, and piping plans for the vessel;
              (iv) Include a statement certifying that the space will be used exclusively for water ballast as prescribed by this section;
              (v) If water ballast is used for stability, describe each loading condition and the resultant metacentric height (GM) and include calculations;
              (vi) If water ballast is used for immersion or trim, describe those conditions and include loading and trim calculations;
              (vii) If water ballast is used for pre-loading, describe how it is used and include strength and weight calculations; and
              (viii) If water ballast is used for seakeeping, describe each loading condition, GM, period of roll, and, if speed is involved, speed versus trim and draft and include calculations.
              (5) If the water ballast space or its use, purpose, or piping are changed, the vessel owner or operator must report the change promptly to a measurement organization listed in § 69.15 for a determination as to whether a tonnage remeasurement is required.Changes in vessel service must also be reported if a water ballast justification was required to be submitted for the vessel.
              (g) Methods for measuring exempt spaces. (1) If the exempt space is located within the superstructure, the exempt space is measured using the same procedures used to measure superstructure tonnage under § 69.113.
              
              (2) If the exempt space is located between-deck, the space is measured using the same procedures used for between-deck tonnage under § 69.111(c), except that the length of the exempt space is divided into the even number of spaces most equal to the number of spaces into which the between-deck was divided.
              (3) If the exempt space is located under-deck, the space is measured using the same procedures used for under-deck tonnage under § 69.109, except that the length of the exempt space is divided into the even number of spaces most equal to the number of spaces into which the under-deck was divided, and the zone of influence method must be applied if the ordinary frames upon which the under-deck breadth measurements are based do not have the same depth of frame.

              § 69.119
              Spaces deducted from tonnage.
              (a) Purpose. This section lists the requirements for spaces (other than propelling machinery spaces under § 69.121) which, though included in calculating gross register tonnage (i.e., are not exempt under § 69.117), are deducted from tonnage in deriving net register tonnage.
              (b) General. (1) A deductible space must be used exclusively for, and be reasonable in size for, its intended purpose.
              (2) When a space is larger than necessary for the safe and efficient operation of deductible equipment, only the space occupied by the equipment plus a two foot maximum working space on each side of the equipment, if available, is deductible.
              (3) Space specified in this section may be located anywhere within the vessel, unless otherwise specified.
              (c) Anchor gear. A space below the line of the uppermost complete deck occupied by the anchor gear, capstan, windlass, and chain locker is deductible. A fore peak used exclusively as chain locker is measured by the method prescribed under § 69.117(g)(3).
              (d) Boatswain's stores. A space containing oils, blocks, hawsers, rigging, deck gear, or other boatswain's stores for daily use is deductible. The maximum deduction allowed for vessels less than 100 gross register tons is one ton and, for vessels 100 gross register tons or over, is one percent of the gross register tonnage, not to exceed 100 tons.
              (e) Chart room. A space for keeping charts and nautical instruments and for plotting the vessel's course is deductible. For a combined wheelhouse and chart room, that part not exempted as wheelhouse under § 69.117(b)(9) is deductible. For small vessels in which the only space for a chart room is in a cabin or saloon, one half the space not to exceed 1.5 tons is deductible as chart room.
              (f) Donkey engine and boiler. Donkey engine and boiler space is deductible when connected with the main (non-cargo) pumps of the vessel, except as follows:
              (1) If the space is within the engine room or within the casing above the engine room and if the donkey engine is an auxiliary to the main propelling machinery, the space is an engine room deduction under § 69.121(b).
              (2) If the space is above the line of the uppermost complete deck and if the donkey engine is not an auxiliary to the main propelling machinery, the space is exempt under § 69.117(b).
              (g) Spaces for the exclusive use of officers or crew. (1) The following spaces, regardless of their location (unless otherwise noted), are deductible if not used by passengers:
              (i) Sleeping rooms.
              (ii) Bathrooms with a bath tub or shower but without a water closet.
              (iii) Water closets below the line of the uppermost complete deck serving more than one person, with or without a bath tub or shower. Water closets, regardless of location, that serve only one person or that are accessible only through a stateroom or bedroom serving one person are considered as part of the space they serve and are deductible only if that space is deductible.
              (iv) Clothes drying rooms.
              
              (v) Drinking water filtration or distilling plant below the line of the uppermost complete deck.
              (vi) Hospitals.
              (vii) Mess rooms.
              (viii) Office of the chief engineer.
              (ix) Oil skin lockers.
              (x) Pantries.
              (xi) Recreation rooms.
              (xii) Smoking rooms.
              (xiii) Galleys below the line of the uppermost complete deck.
              (2) Shops for engineers, carpenters, plumbers, or butchers and offices for clerks, pursers, or postmasters are not deductible, wherever located.
              (h) Master's cabin. The master's sleeping room, dressing room, bathroom, observation room, reception room, sitting room, water closet, and office are deductible.
              (i) Radio room. Spaces in which radio apparatus is installed and messages are sent and received and which may provide off-duty operator accommodations are deductible.
              (j) Steering gear. Spaces for steering gear below the line of the uppermost complete deck are deductible.
              (k) Generators. Spaces for generators below the line of the uppermost complete deck are deductible regardless of what space the generators serve. These spaces may include other equipment necessary for the generator's operation.
              (l) Pump room. Spaces below the line of the uppermost complete deck containing pumps that are not capable of handling cargo and that are not fuel oil transfer pumps considered part of the propelling machinery under § 69.121(b)(2)(v) are deductible.
              (m) Sail stowage. A space for stowing sails on a vessel propelled only by sails is deductible up to two and one-half percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage.
              (n) Waste material space. (1) A tank or collection space, regardless of location, used for the carriage or collection of sewage, garbage, galley waste, trash, slop-oil mixture, tank cleaning residue, bilge residue, or other waste material generated aboard the vessel is deductible.
              (2) Space below the line of the uppermost complete deck used exclusively to separate, clarify, purify, or otherwise process waste material generated aboard the vessel is deductible.
              (o) Passageways. A passageway or companionway is deductible—
              (1) If it serves deductible spaces only; or
              (2) If it serves deductible spaces and is also the sole means of access to one of the following non-deductible spaces:
              (i) Lockers of less than two tons each, containing medicine, linen, mops, or other items for the free use of the crew.
              (ii) A ship's office.
              (iii) Spare rooms (not exceeding two) used by a pilot, customs officer, reserve engineer, or employee or agent of the vessel's owner or operator.
              (p) Markings for deductible spaces. (1) Each space deducted under this section must be marked with the words “Certified ___” (inserting the space designation, such as “Seaman”, “Generator”, Office of Chief Engineer”, “Hospital”, or “Anchor Gear”). If a deductible space berths more than one crew member, the marking must indicate the number of crew members berthed, such as “Certified ___ Seamen” (inserting the number of crew).
              (2) The abbreviations “Cert.” for “certified” and “W.C.” for “water closet” may be used.
              (3) The markings must be in Roman letters and Arabic numerals at least 1/2 inch in height, must be painted in a light color on a dark background, must be embossed, center-punched, carved, or permanently cut in a bulkhead or metal plate, and must be placed in a legible location over a doorway on the inside of the space. A metal plate, if used, must be permanently fastened in place by welding, riveting, lock screws, or a Coast Guard-approved bonding agent.
              (q) Method for measuring deductible spaces. (1) A rectangular space must be measured by taking the product of its length, breadth, and height.
              (2) A space with curved sides on or above the tonnage deck is measured according to § 69.109.
              (3) Space less than 15 feet in length may be measured by any practical method.

              (4) Spaces below the tonnage deck exceeding 15 feet in length and bounded by a curved surface conforming to the side of the vessel must be measured by the formula used for measuring the superstructure under § 69.113.
              (5) The height of a space located on a platform in the hull must be measured from the top of the bottom hull frames, if the platform is used only to form a flat surface at the bottom of the space, if the platform is not more than one foot above the top of the bottom frames, and if the space below the platform is not usable.
              (6) The height of a space is measured through any ceiling, paneling, false overhead, or other covering, to the space's structural boundary, unless the space enclosed by the covering is available for a non-deductible use.

              § 69.121
              Engine room deduction.
              (a) General. The engine room deduction is either a percentage of the vessel's total propelling machinery spaces or a percentage of the vessel's gross register tonnage.
              (b) Propelling machinery spaces. (1) Propelling machinery spaces are the spaces occupied by the main propelling machinery and auxiliary machinery and spaces reasonably necessary for the operation and maintenance of the machinery. Propelling machinery spaces do not include spaces for fuel tanks, spaces exempt from tonnage under § 69.117, and spaces not used or not available for use in connection with the propelling machinery.
              (2) Propelling machinery spaces are—
              (i) Space below the crown. The crown is the top of the main space of the engine room to which the heights of the main space are taken. The crown is either the underside of a deck or, if the side bulkheads are sloping, the uppermost point at which the slope terminates. (See § 69.123, figures 13 and 14.)
              (ii) Framed-in space located between the crown and the uppermost complete deck and used for propelling machinery or for the admission of light or air to propelling machinery spaces. (See § 69.123, figures 13 and 14.)
              (iii) Shaft tunnel space and thrust block recess space.
              (iv) Space below the uppermost complete deck used for escape shafts or trunked ladderways leading from the aft end of the shaft tunnel to the deck above.
              (v) Space containing a fuel oil transfer pump located in a separate space and not used for bunkering the vessel. When the pump serves both ballast and fuel oil, only one-half of the pump's space is considered a propelling machinery space.
              (vi) Spaces containing fuel oil settling tanks used solely for the main boilers. The space must not exceed one percent of the vessel's gross tonnage.
              (vii) Spaces for engineers' stores and workshops located below the uppermost complete deck and either open to a propelling machinery space or separated from a propelling machinery space only by a screen bulkhead. The space must not exceed three-quarters of one percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage.
              (viii) Framed-in space located above the line of the uppermost complete deck and used for propelling machinery or for the admission of light or air to a propelling machinery space, when requested under paragraph (d) of this section.
              (ix) If the propelling machinery is boxed-in below the tonnage deck, the boxed-in space plus the spaces outside of the boxing for the shaft, auxiliary engines, and related propelling machinery. If a portion of the boxed-in space extends above a platform or partial deck that is below the uppermost complete deck, that portion is also considered part of the propelling machinery space.
              (c) Methods for measuring propelling machinery spaces. (1) If the propelling machinery space is bulkheaded off or is not larger than necessary for the safe operation and maintenance of the propelling machinery, the entire space, or, if bulkheaded off, the portion bulkheaded off, is measured for the engine room deduction.

              (2) If the propelling machinery space is not bulkheaded off or is larger than necessary for the safe operation and maintenance of the propelling machinery, only the space occupied by the propelling machinery itself plus a working space of two feet, if available, on each side of the propelling machinery is measured for the engine room deduction. If the working space overlaps another working space not related to the propelling machinery, only one-half of the overlapping working space is included in the propelling machinery space. The height of the working space is measured as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (3) If the propelling machinery is located in more than one space, each space must be measured separately.
              (4) If the propelling machinery is located in a space with a step in the bottom or side lines, each stepped portion of the space must be measured separately.
              (5) The length of a space under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is measured from the bulkhead just forward of the propelling machinery to the bulkhead just aft of the propelling machinery. The length of a space under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is measured from the forward edge of the working space to the aft edge of the working space.
              (6) If the boundaries of the propelling machinery space form a rectangle, the product of the length, breadth, and height, divided by 100, is the tonnage of the space.
              (7) If the boundaries of the propelling machinery space are continuous fair lines, heights are measured at the fore and aft ends and at the center of the space from the bottom frames, floors, or tank top of a double bottom up to the line of the crown. A breadth is measured at half-height of each height. The product of the length, mean breadth, and mean height, divided by 100, is the tonnage of the space.
              (8) If the propelling machinery space is in the aft end of the hull, extends from side to side of the hull, and has a continuous bottom line, the length of the space is divided into the even number of equal parts most nearly equal to the number of parts that the tonnage length under § 69.109(g) was divided. The tonnage is then calculated by the same method used for calculating the under-deck tonnage in § 69.109(l).
              (9) The tonnage of a framed-in space located between the crown and the uppermost complete deck and used for propelling machinery or for the admission of light or air to the propelling machinery space, is the product of its length, breadth, and height, divided by 100.
              (10) The tonnage of a shaft tunnel, or a thrust block recess, having a flat top is the product of its length, breadth, and height, divided by 100. If the shaft tunnel or thrust block recess top is not flat, the space above must be calculated by using the appropriate geometrical formula. If the space aft of the shaft tunnel extends from side to side of the vessel, the tonnage of the space is found by the formula for measuring peak tanks in § 69.109(l).
              (11) The length and breadth of the space for a shaft tunnel, or a thrust block recess, when not cased is that which is necessary for maintenance of the shaft. The height allowed for thrust block recess space must not exceed seven feet. The mean height allowed for the shaft tunnel space must not exceed six feet. In a multi-screw vessel where the shaft tunnel or thrust block recess space is open from side to side, measure only the space used for purposes of propelling the vessel.
              (12) When the propelling machinery is on a bed at the vessel's bottom, the height of the propelling machinery space is measured from the top of the bottom frames or floors.
              (d) Request to treat certain framed-in engine room spaces as part of a propelling machinery space. (1) Under § 69.117(b)(4), framed-in spaces located above the line of the uppermost complete deck and used for propelling machinery or for admitting light or air to a propelling machinery space are exempt from inclusion in tonnage. However, upon written request to a measurement organization listed in § 69.15, the vessel owner may elect to have these spaces included in calculating the gross register tonnage, then deducted from the gross register tonnage as propelling machinery spaces under paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section when calculating the net register tonnage.

              (2) The framed-in space must be safe, seaworthy, and used only for propelling machinery or for the admission of light or air to the propelling machinery space. The length of the space must not exceed the length of the propelling machinery space and the breadth must not exceed one-half of the extreme inside midship breadth of the vessel. Portions of the framed-in space that are plated over are not included in the propelling machinery space.
              (3) To exercise the option in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, all of the framed-in space need not be treated as propelling machinery space, but only that portion required to entitle the vessel to have 32 percent of its gross register tonnage deducted as an engine room deduction under paragraph (e) of this section.
              (e) Calculating the engine room deduction. (1) The engine room deduction is based on a percentage of the vessel's gross register tonnage or a percentage of the total propelling machinery space.
              (2) For vessels propelled in whole or in part by screw—
              (i) If the total propelling machinery space is 13 percent or less of the vessel's gross register tonnage, deduct 32/13 times the total propelling machinery space;
              (ii) If the total propelling machinery space is more than 13 but less than 20 percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage, deduct 32 percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage; or
              (iii) If the total propelling machinery space is 20 percent or more of the vessel's gross register tonnage, deduct either 32 percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage or 1.75 times the total propelling machinery space, whichever the vessel owner elects.
              (3) For vessels propelled in whole or in part by paddle-wheel—
              (i) If the total propelling machinery space is 20 percent or less of the vessel's gross register tonnage, deduct 37/20 times the total propelling machinery space;

            Subpart D —Dual Regulatory Measurements System
            
              § 69.151
              Purpose.
              This subpart prescribes measurement requirements for the assignment of either one gross and one net register tonnage or two gross and two net register tonnages to vessels under this subpart.
              [CGD 87-015b, 54 FR 37657, Sept. 12, 1989, as amended by USCG-2011-0522, 81 FR 18731, Mar. 31, 2016]
            
            
              § 69.153
              Application of other laws.
              (a) If a vessel is assigned two gross register tonnages under § 69.175(b), the higher gross register tonnage is the tonnage used when applying inspection, manning, and load line laws and regulations to the vessel.
              (b) Tonnage marks are not to be construed as additional load line marks. Whether or not a tonnage mark is submerged under § 69.171 has no effect on the applicability of load line laws and regulations.

              § 69.171
              When the tonnage mark is considered submerged.
              For the purpose of this subpart, a tonnage mark is considered submerged when—
              (a) In salt or brackish water, the upper edge of the tonnage mark is submerged; and
              (b) In fresh or tropical water, the upper edge of the line for fresh and tropical waters is submerged.
            
            
              § 69.173
              Register Tonnage assignments for vessels with only one deck.

              A vessel without a second deck is assigned only one gross and one net register tonnage. In calculating the gross register tonnage, only the exemptions in § 69.169 (a) through (d) are allowed. Markings under § 69.177 are not permitted on these vessels.

              § 69.175
              Tonnage assignments for vessels with a second deck.
              (a) At the option of the vessel owner, a vessel having a second deck is assigned either two gross and two net register tonnages or one gross and one net register tonnage corresponding to the lower gross and net register tonnages.
              (b) If two gross and two net register tonnages are assigned, the higher tonnages (i.e. those based only on exemptions under § 69.169 (a) through (d)) are applicable when the upper edge of the tonnage mark is submerged and the lower tonnages (i.e. those based only on all exemptions under § 69.169) are applicable when the upper edge of the tonnage mark is not submerged.
              (c) If only the low gross and low net register tonnages, as calculated under paragraph (b) of this section, are assigned, these tonnages are applicable at all times. On these vessels, a load line must be assigned at a level below the line of the second deck, and the tonnage mark must be located in accordance with § 69.177(a)(6) at the level of the uppermost part of the load line grid.

              § 69.177
              Markings.
              (a) Tonnage mark. (1) All vessels with a second deck that are measured under this subpart must have, on each side of the vessel, a tonnage mark, and an inverted triangle identifying the tonnage mark, as described and located under this section. (See the figure in § 69.183(a).) Vessels with only one deck are not assigned markings under this section.
              (2) The tonnage mark is a horizontal line 15 inches long and one inch wide. The tonnage mark must be designated by a welded bead or other permanent mark 15 inches long placed along the top edge of the tonnage mark.
              (3) Above the tonnage mark is placed an inverted equilateral triangle, each side of which is 12 inches long and one inch wide, with its apex touching the upper edge of the center of the tonnage mark.
              (4) If the vessel has a load line mark, the longitudinal location of the center of the tonnage mark must be between 21 inches and six feet six inches aft of the vertical centerline of the load line ring. (See the figures in § 69.183 (b) and (c).) If the vessel does not have a load line mark, the center of the tonnage mark must be located amidships.
              (5) Except as under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the upper edge of the tonnage mark must be located below the line of the second deck at the distance indicated in Table 69.177(a)(5). (See the figure in § 69.183(b).)

              (6) For the following vessels with a load line mark, the upper edge of the tonnage mark must be located at the level of the uppermost part of the load line grid:
              (i) Vessels assigned only one gross and one net register tonnage under § 69.175(c).
              (ii) Vessels for which a load line assigning authority certifies that the vessel's load line mark was located as though the second deck were the freeboard deck.
              (b) Line for fresh and tropical waters. (1) Except as under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a horizontal line for fresh and tropical waters may be assigned at the vessel owner's request.
              
              (2) The line must be nine inches long and one inch wide and located above and to the left of the tonnage mark at a distance equal to one forty-eighth of the distance from the top of the flat keel to the tonnage mark. The tonnage mark and the line for fresh and tropical waters must be connected by a vertical line one inch wide. (See the figure in § 69.183(a).)
              (3) The line for fresh and tropical waters must be designated by a welded bead or other permanent mark nine inches long placed along the upper edge of the line.
              (4) For vessels with a load line mark, if the load line assigning authority certifies that the load line mark was located as though the second deck were the freeboard deck, a line for fresh and tropical waters must not be placed on the vessel.
              (c) Freeboard deck mark. A vessel assigned two gross and two net register tonnages which has more than one deck and no load line mark assigned must have a mark on each side of the vessel with the same dimensions and location as the freeboard deck line mark under § 42.13-20 of this chapter, except that the mark must be located directly above the tonnage mark.
              (d) The line of the second deck. The line of the second deck must not be marked on the side of the vessel, except in the case of a freeboard deck line mark placed at the location of the second deck if the second deck is the actual freeboard deck for purposes of a vessel's load line assignment.
              (e) Color of markings. All markings under this section must be maintained in either a light color on a dark background or a dark color on a light background.

              Certification of markings.
              (a) Before a certificate of measurement is issued for a vessel requiring a tonnage mark, a certification by a measurement organization under § 69.15 that all markings meet the requirements of this subpart is required.
              (b) The Coast Guard, at any time, may verify markings under this subpart.
            
            
              § 69.181
              Locating the line of the second deck.
              (a) If the second deck is not stepped, the line of the second deck is the longitudinal line of the underside of the second deck at the side of the hull.
              (b) If the second deck is stepped (as in the examples following this paragraph), the line of the second deck is a longitudinal line extended parallel to each portion of the second deck and located at the height of the underside of the amidships portion of the second deck at the side of the hull—
              (1) Plus, for each stepped portion of the second deck higher than the second deck at amidships, a distance equal to the length of the stepped portion divided by the total length of the second deck times the height that the step is above the height of the amidship portion of the second deck; and

              § 69.201
              Purpose.
              This subpart prescribes the procedures for measuring a vessel under the Simplified Regulatory Measurement System described in 46 U.S.C. chapter 145, subchapter III.
              [CGD 87-015b, 54 FR 37657, Sept. 12, 1989, as amended by USCG-2011-0522, 81 FR 18732, Mar. 31, 2016]
            
            
              § 69.203
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart and in Coast Guard Form CG-5397 under § 69.205—
              
                Overall breadth means the horizontal distance taken at the widest part of the hull, excluding rub rails, from the outboard side of the skin (outside planking or plating) on one side of the hull to the outboard side of the skin on the other side of the hull.
              
                Overall depth means the vertical distance taken at or near midships from a line drawn horizontally through the uppermost edges of the skin (outside planking or plating) at the sides of the hull (excluding the cap rail, trunks, cabins, and deckhouses) to the outboard face of the bottom skin of the hull, excluding the keel. For a vessel that is designed for sailing and has a keel faired to the hull, the keel is included in “overall depth” if the distance to the bottom skin of the hull cannot be determined reasonably.
              
                Overall length means the horizontal distance between the outboard side of the foremost part of the stem and the outboard side of the aftermost part of the stern, excluding rudders, outboard motor brackets, and other similar fittings and attachments.
              
                Registered breadth means—
              (a) For a single-hull vessel, the vessel's overall breadth; and

              (b) For a multi-hull vessel, the horizontal distance taken at the widest part of the complete vessel between the outboard side of the skin (outside planking or plating) on the outboardmost side of one of the outboardmost hulls to the outboard side of the skin on the outboardmost side of the other outboardmost hull, excluding rubrails.
              
                Registered depth means—
              (a) For a single-hull vessel, the vessel's overall depth; and
              (b) For a multi-hull vessel, the overall depth of the deepest hull.
              
                Registered length means—
              (a) For a single-hull vessel, the vessel's overall length; and
              (b) For a multi-hull vessel, the horizontal distance between the outboard side of the foremost part of the stem of the foremost hull and the outboard side of the aftermost part of the stern of the aftermost hull, excluding fittings or attachments.
              
                Vessel designed for sailing means a vessel which has the fine lines of a sailing craft and is capable of being propelled by sail, whether or not the vessel is equipped with an auxiliary motor, a decorative sail, or a sail designed only to steady the vessel.
              [CGD 87-015b, 54 FR 37657, Sept. 12, 1989; 54 FR 40240, Sept. 29, 1989; USCG-1999-6216, 64 FR 53225, Oct. 1, 1999]
            
            
              § 69.205
              Application for measurement services.
              (a) Except as noted under paragraph (c) of this section, to apply for measurement under this subpart, the vessel owner must complete an Application for Simplified Measurement (form CG-5397). If the vessel is documented, or intended to be documented, as a vessel of the United States under part 67 of this chapter, the vessel owner must submit the application form to the National Vessel Documentation Center. Otherwise, the form is not further processed, but may be retained, at the vessel owner's option, as evidence of the tonnage measurement under this part.
              (b) The Application for Simplified Measurement (form CG-5397) must include the following information:
              (1) Vessel's name and number (e.g., official number, International Maritime Organization (IMO) number, or Coast Guard number).
              (2) Vessel hull identification number or other number assigned by builder.
              (3) Hull material.
              (4) Hull shape.
              (5) Overall length, breadth, and depth of vessel and each of the vessel's individual hulls.
              (6) Location of any propelling machinery (e.g., inside or outside of the hull).
              (7) Dimensions of the principal deck structure, if its volume exceeds the volume of the hull.
              (c) At the vessel owner's option, a Builder's Certification and First Transfer of Title (form CG-1261), which includes the same information specified in paragraph (b) of this section may be submitted to the National Vessel Documentation Center instead of the Application for Simplified Measurement for a vessel that is documented, or intended to be documented, as a vessel of the United States under part 67 of this chapter.

              § 69.207
              Measurements.
              (a) All lengths and depths must be measured in a vertical plane at centerline and breadths must be measured in a line at right angles to that plane. All dimensions must be expressed in feet and inches to the nearest inch or in feet and tenths of a foot to the nearest tenth of a foot.
              (b) For a multi-hull vessel, each hull must be measured separately for overall length, breadth, and depth and the vessel as a whole must be measured for registered length, breadth, and depth.
              (c) The Coast Guard may verify dimensions of vessels measured under this subpart.

              § 69.209
              Gross and net register tonnages.
              (a) Gross register tonnage. (1) Except as in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this section, the gross register tonnage of a vessel designed for sailing is one-half of the product of its overall length, overall breadth, and overall depth (LBD) divided by one hundred (i.e., 0.50 LBD/100), and the gross register tonnage of a vessel not designed for sailing is 0.67 LBD/100.

              (2) The gross tonnage of a vessel with a hull that approximates in shape a rectangular geometric solid (barge-shape) is 0.84 LBD/100.
              
              (3) The gross tonnage of a multi-hull vessel is the sum of all the hulls as calculated under this section.
              (4) If the volume of the principal deck structure of a vessel is as large as, or larger than, the volume of the vessel's hull, the volume of the principal deck structure in tons of 100 cubic feet is added to the tonnage of the hull to establish the vessel's gross tonnage. The volume of the principal deck structure of a vessel is determined by the product of its average dimensions.
              (5) If the overall depth of a vessel designed for sailing includes the keel, only 75 percent of that depth is used for gross tonnage calculations.
              (b) Net register tonnage. (1) For a vessel having propelling machinery in its hull—
              (i) The net register tonnage is 90 percent of its gross register tonnage, if it is a vessel designed for sailing; or
              (ii) The net register tonnage is 80 percent of its gross register tonnage, if it is not a vessel designed for sailing.
              (2) For a vessel having no propelling machinery in its hull, the net register tonnage is the same as its gross register tonnage.
              (c) Certification of measurement. For a vessel that is documented as a vessel of the United States under part 67 of this chapter, the vessel's Certificate of Documentation serves as evidence of measurement under this subpart. For all other vessels, a completed Application for Simplified Measurement (form CG-5397) serves as evidence of the tonnage measurement under this part.
