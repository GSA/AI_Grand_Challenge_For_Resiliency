      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This specification covers life preservers which essentially consist of a vest-cut envelope containing pockets in which are enclosed pads of buoyant material, the life preserver being fitted with tapes and webbing to provide complete reversibility, proper adjustment for close fit to the bodies of various size wearers, and proper flotation characteristics to hold the wearer in an upright backward position with head and face out of water.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Envelope.</E> The envelope shall be of not more than two pieces, one piece for either side, cut to the pattern shown on Dwg. No. 160.005-1, Sheet 1, for adult size, and Sheet 4, for child size, joined by seams and stitching as shown on the drawing. A drawstring tunnel shall be formed by stitching a strip of the tunnel strip material as shown by the drawing. The ends of the tunnel strip shall be tucked under the reinforcing tape stitched around the end openings so there is no direct access to the pads from the outside. Three pockets shall be formed for insertion of the pads. The two front pads shall be removable from the envelope when portions of the lower longitudinal seam are opened, and the back pad shall be removable when a portion of one armhole seam is opened.<PRTPAGE P="30"/>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Buoyancy test.</E> Known weights are loaded on the sample buoyant apparatus until it is awash. The buoyancy is the downward force exerted by the weights loaded on the apparatus. A raised platform of known weight having two runners on edge spaced so as to bear on the apparatus may be used to support the weights out of water to avoid the necessity for making allowances for the displacement of submerged weights. This test is not a required production test if the manufacturer—</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Watertight integrity test.</E> The buoyant apparatus is submerged for 24 hours at a depth of 3 m (10 ft.) or equivalent water pressure. The final buoyancy of the buoyant apparatus is determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The final buoyancy must be at least 145 N (32 lb.) per person capacity of the buoyant apparatus or 180 N (40 lb.) per person capacity if the apparatus is designed so that persons supported are only partially immersed or if facilities are provided for climbing on top of the apparatus. The loss of buoyancy must not exceed 5 percent of the initial buoyancy. This test is not a required production test if the manufacturer uses the plastic buoyancy foam controls permitted as an alternative to the buoyancy test in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Painter attachment strength test.</E> The apparatus must be positioned with its painter attachment fitting at the lowest point of the apparatus, directly below the center of buoyancy. The apparatus must be suspended in this position from the highest side. A load equal to twice the buoyancy of the apparatus must be suspended from the painter attachment fitting for 10 minutes. The fitting must remain firmly attached to the buoyant apparatus and the apparatus must not sustain any visible damage.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Stability test.</E> With the sample buoyant apparatus floating in water, a weight of 22.5 kg of iron per meter of length (15 lb. per foot) must be suspended in the water from the life lines along one of the longer edges. The same test must be performed along one of the shorter edges. The minimum weight along any one edge must be 27 kg (60 lb.). The buoyant apparatus must neither capsize nor become partially awash under either of these tests.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Weight test.</E> One buoyant apparatus of the lot submitted for approval must be weighed. The weight of the complete buoyant apparatus must be within the limit required in § 160.010-3(d).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Each approval test must be conducted on a ladder of the longest length for which approval has been requested. If a ladder fails one of the tests in this section, the cause of the failure must be identified and any needed changes made. After a test failure and any design change, the failed test, and any other previously completed tests affected by the design change, must be rerun.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Visual examination.</E> Before starting the tests described in this section, an assembled chain ladder is examined for evidence of noncompliance with the requirements in §§ 160.017.11, 160.017-13, and 160.017-15.</P>
              <P>(c) The following approval tests must be conducted:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Strength test #1.</E> An assembled ladder is supported so that a static load, if placed on any of its steps, would exert a force both on the step and each suspension member. A static load of 315 kg (700 lb.) is then placed on one step for at least one minute. The load must be uniformly distributed over a contact surface that is approximately 100 mm (4 in.) wide. The center of the contact surface must be at the center of the step. This test is performed on six different steps. No step may break, crack, or incur any deformation that remains after the static load is removed. No attachment between any step and a suspension member may loosen or break during this test.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Strength test #2.</E> A ladder is suspended vertically to its full length from its top lashing rings. A static load of 900 kg (2000 lbs.) is then applied to the bottom lashing rings so that it is distributed equally between the suspension members. The suspension members, lashing rings, and spacer ears must not break, incur any elongation or deformation that remains after the test load is removed, or be damaged in any other way during this test.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Strength test #3.</E> A rolled-up ladder is attached by its top lashing rings to anchoring fixtures in a location away from any wall or structure that would prevent it from falling freely, and where it can hang to its full length vertically. The ladder when dropped must unroll freely. When unrolling the ladder, its steps and attachments must not become cracked, broken, or loosened. Other similar damage making the ladder unsafe to use must likewise not occur.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Each ladder manufactured under Coast Guard approval must be tested in accordance with this section and subpart 159.007 of this chapter. Steps that fail testing may not be marked with the Coast Guard approval number and each assembled ladder that fails testing may not be sold as Coast Guard approved.<PRTPAGE P="44"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Test #1: Steps.</E> Steps must be separated into lots of 100 steps or less. One step from each lot must be selected at random and tested as described in § 106.017-21(c)(1), except that the step may be supported at the points where it would be attached to suspension members in an assembled ladder. If the step fails the test, ten more steps must be selected at random from the lot and tested. If one or more of the ten steps fails the test, each step in the lot must be tested.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Test #2: Ladders.</E> Assembled ladders must be separated into lots of 20 ladders or less One ladder must be selected at random from the ladders in the lot. The ladder selected must be at least 3 m (10 ft.) long or, if each ladder in the lot is less than 3 m long, a ladder of the longest length in the lot must be selected. The ladder must be tested as prescribed in § 160.017-21(c)(2), except that only a 3 m section of the ladder need be subjected to the static load. If the ladder fails the test each other ladder in the lot must be tested.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Independent laboratory.</E> Each production test must be conducted or supervised by an independent laboratory. However, if a test is performed more than 4 different times per year, laboratory participation is required only 4 times per year. If the laboratory does not participate in all tests, the times of laboratory participation must be as selected by the laboratory. The times selected must provide for effective monitoring throughout the production schedule.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Visual examination.</E> The visual examination described in § 160.017-21(b) must be conducted as a part of each production test.</P>

              <P>(a) Hand red flare distress signals specified by this subpart shall be of one type which shall consist essentially of a wooden handle to which is attached a tubular casing having a sealing plug at the handle end, the casing being filled with a flare composition and having a button of ignition material at the top, with a removable cap having a friction striking material on its top which may be exposed for use by pulling a tear strip. The flare is ignited by scraping the friction striker on top of the cap against the igniter button on top of the flare. The general arrangement of the flare is shown by Figure No. 160.021-2(a). Alternate arrangements which conform to all the performance requirements of this specification (and other arrangements which conform with all performance requirements except candlepower and burning time, but provide not less than 3,000 candela-minutes with a minimum of <FR>1/3</FR> minute burning time) will be given special consideration.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Materials, workmanship, construction and performance requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Materials.</E> The materials shall conform strictly to the specifications and drawings submitted by the manufacturer and approved by the Commandant. The color of the tube shall be red. Flare compositions containing sulphur shall not contain more than 2.6 percent of potassium chlorate or an equivalent amount of any other chlorate. Flare compositions containing chlorates in any quantity shall not contain any ammonium salts.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Workmanship.</E> Hand red flare distress signals shall be of first class workmanship and shall be free from imperfections of manufacture affecting their appearance or that may affect their serviceability. Moistureproof coatings shall be applied uniformly and shall be free from pinholes or other visible defects which would impair their usefulness.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Construction.</E> The casing shall be fitted and secured to the handle with not less than a 25 mm (1 in.) overlap and shall be attached to the handle in such a manner that failure of the joint will not occur during tests, ignition, or operation. The plug shall be securely affixed in the casing to separate the flare composition from the wooden handle. The flare composition shall be thoroughly mixed and be uniformly compressed throughout to preclude variations of density which may adversely affect uniformity of its burning characteristics. The cap shall have a lap fit of not less than 25 mm (1 in.) over the end of the casing and flare composition to entirely and securely protect the exposed surface of the igniter button and end of flare composition and casing, and shall have an inner shoulder so constructed that it is mechanically impossible for the inner surface of the cap to come in contact with the igniter button. The cap shall be securely attached to the casing in such manner as to preclude its accidental detachment. The cap shall be provided on its top with a friction striking material which shall, by a pull of the tear strip, be entirely exposed for striking the friction igniter button. The igniter button shall be non-water soluble or be protected from moisture by a coating of some waterproof substance, and shall be raised or exposed in such manner as to provide positive ignition by the friction striker. The igniter button shall be firmly secured in or on the top of the flare composition; the arrangement shall be such that the ignition will be transmitted to the flare composition. The assembled flare, consisting of tear strip, cap, casing, and handle, shall be sealed and treated to protect the flare from deterioration by moisture. The protective waterproof coating shall be applied so none adheres to the friction striking surface. Special consideration will be given to alternate waterproofing of the signal by means of a water-resistant coating on the signal plus packaging in a sealed plastic waterproof bag satisfactory to the Commandant.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Approval and production tests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval tests.</E> The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least 100 signals from which samples must be taken for testing for approval under § 160.021-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this Chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Production inspections and tests.</E> Production inspections and tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the procedures in § 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and the results of the second test.<PRTPAGE P="47"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Lot size.</E> For the purposes of sampling the production of signals, a lot must consist of not more than 30,000 signals. Lots must be numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started with: (i) Any change in construction details, (ii) any change in sources of raw materials, or (iii) the start of production on a new production line or on a previously discontinued production line.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by the manufacturer.</E> The manufacturer's quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested in accordance with the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory.</E> An independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this Chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the number of lots produced in year is less than four. The inspections and tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no lots are produced during that period. If less than four lots are produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Operational tests.</E> Each lot of signals must be sampled and tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria.</E> A sample of signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample must be the individual sample size in Table 160.021-4(c)(1) corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defects (Table 160.021-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance with that table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal. If the sum of all the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the lot is accepted. If the cumulative failure percent falls between the accept and reject criteria, another sample is selected from the production lot and the operational tests are repeated. The cumulative failure percent of each sample tested is added to that of the previous samples to obtain the cumulative failure percent for all the signals tested (cumulative sample size). Additional samples are tested and the tests repeated until either the accept or reject criterion for the cumulative sample size is met. If any signal in the sample explodes when fired or ignited in a way that could burn or otherwise injure the person firing it, the lot is rejected without further testing. (This procedure is diagrammed in figure 160.021-4(c)).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Conditioning of test specimens—water resistance.</E> Immerse specimen horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours. If the signal is protected by alternate waterproofing consisting of a water-resistant coating on the signal plus packaging in a sealed plastic waterproof bag, the 24-hour water immersion conditioning will be conducted while the signal is in the sealed plastic waterproof bag and will be followed by an additional immersion of the bare signal (i.e., after removal from the bag) 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 10 minutes.<PRTPAGE P="48"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Waterproofing of igniter button.</E> Remove the cap from the test specimen. Place head of specimen without cap about 25 mm (1 in .) under the surface of water for approximately 5 minutes. Remove specimen from the water and wipe dry.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Ignition and burning characteristics.</E> Test specimens shall ignite and burn satisfactorily with uniform intensity when the directions on the signal are followed. Test specimens shall not ignite explosively in a manner that might be dangerous to the user or persons close by. The plug separating the flare composition from the handle shall in no case allow flame or hot gases to pass through it or between it and the casing in such manner as might burn the hand while holding the signal by the handle.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Burning time.</E> The burning time of a specimen shall be obtained by stop watch measurements from the time a distinct sustained flame is emitted until it ceases. Test specimens shall burn in air not less than 2 minutes.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Underwater burning.</E> Condition each sample in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Ignite specimen and let it burn about 5 seconds in air. Submerge the burning signal in water in a vertical position with head down. Obtain under water burning time by stop watch measurement from time of submersion until distinct, sustained flame emission ceases. The test specimen shall burn under water not less than 5 seconds when subjected to this test.</P>

              </GPH>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Bending strength.</E> Place the specimen on supports 15 cm (6 in.) apart. Attach a weight of 35 kg (77 lb.) to a length of wire. Hang the weight from the supported signal by looping the wire around the signal approximately <PRTPAGE P="50"/>equidistant from the two points of support. Let the weight hang approximately 5 minutes. The test specimen shall not deflect more than 7 mm (1/4 in.), nor shall the joint between the casing and the handle fail, when subjected to this test.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Tensile strength.</E> Place the specimen in a chuck firmly holding it about 13 mm (1/2 in.) below the cap. Attach a weight of 35 kg (77 lb.) to a length of wire. Hang the weight from the supported signal by looping the wire through a hole bored perpendicular to and through the axis of the handle. Let the weight hang approximately 5 minutes. The test specimen shall not show noticeable distortion, nor shall the joint between the casing and handle fail, when subjected to this test.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Luminous intensity.</E> The luminous intensity of each specimen tested shall be measured by a visual photometer or equivalent photometric device, while the specimen is supported in a horizontal position and the photometer is at right angles to the axis of the specimen. Visual luminous intensity readings shall be observed and recorded at approximately 20 second intervals during the burning of the specimen. The minimum photometric distance shall be 3 m (10 ft.). Recording photometers shall have a chart speed of at least 25 mm (1 in.) per minute. The luminous intensity of specimen shall be computed as the arithmetical average of the readings recorded. The average luminous intensity of a test specimen shall be not less than 500 candela. The burning time of a specimen shall be obtained by stop watch measurements from the time distinct, sustained flame is emitted until it ceases. Test specimens shall burn in air not less than 2 minutes.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Elevated temperature, humidity and storage.</E> Place specimen in a thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75 °C. with not less than 90 percent relative humidity for 72 hours. Remove specimen and store at room temperature (20° to 25 °C.) with approximately 65 percent relative humidity for 10 days. If for any reason it is not possible to operate the oven continuously for the 72-hour period, it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity for 8 hours out of each 24 during the 72-hour conditioning period. (Total of 24 hours on and 48 hours off.) The signal shall not ignite or decompose during this conditioning. The signal shall ignite and operate satisfactorily following this conditioning.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Spontaneous ignition.</E> Place the specimen in a thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75 °C. with not more than 10% relative humidity for 48 consecutive hours. The signals shall not ignite or undergo marked decomposition.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Chromaticity.</E> The color of the burning signal must be vivid red as defined by sections 13 and 14 of the “Color Names Dictionary.” Two identical test plates of white cardboard about 30 cm × 60 cm (12″ × 24″) are used. Except for a negligible amount of stray daylight, the first test plate is illuminated by light from the specimen placed at a distance of about 1.5 m (5 ft.). The second test plate is illuminated only by light from an incandescent lamp operated at a color temperature close to 2,848 °K at a distance of about 30 cm (1 ft.). The first plate is viewed directly, the second through combinations of Lovibond red, yellow, and blue glasses selected so as to approximate a chromaticity match. By separating the test plates by a wide unilluminated area (subtending at the observer about 45°), it is possible to make accurate determinations of chromaticity in terms of the 1931 CIE Standard Observer and Coordinate System, in spite of fluctuations in luminous intensity of the specimen by factors as high as 2 or 3. The CIE coordinates are converted to the Munsell notation which is cross-referenced to the color name in Section 13 of the “Color Names Dictionary” (see the discussion in section 10 of “The Universal Color Language”).</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Heptane ignition.</E> (i) A metal pan must be used to hold a layer of water at least 12mm (<FR>1/2</FR> in.) deep with a layer of technical grade heptane on top of the water. The pan must be at least 1 m (39 in.) square with sides extending between 175 mm (7 in.) and 200 mm (8 in.) above the surface of the water. The amount of heptane used to form the layer must be 2.0 liters per square <PRTPAGE P="51"/>meter of pan area (6.25 fluid ounces per square foot).</P>
              <P>(ii) The test must be conducted in a draft-free location. The ambient temperature, the temperature of the water, and the temperature of the heptane must all be between 20 °C (68 °F) and 25 °C (77 °F) at the time of the test.</P>
              <P>(iii) The signal under test must be held with the flame end pointing upward at an angle of approximately 45°, 1.2 m (4 ft.) directly above the center of the pan. The signal must be ignited as soon as the heptane is observed to spread out over the water in continuous layer. The signal must be allowed to burn completely, and must remain in position until it has cooled.</P>

              <P>(iv) The heptane must not be ignited by the flare or by material from the flare.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval tests.</E> The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least 100 signals from which samples must be taken for testing for approval under § 160.022-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Production inspections and tests.</E> Production inspections and tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the procedures in § 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and the results of the second test.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Lot size.</E> For the purposes of sampling the production of signals, a lot must consist of not more than 30,000 signals. Lots must be numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started with:</P>
              <P>(i) Any change in construction details,</P>
              <P>(ii) Any change in sources of raw materials, or</P>
              <P>(iii) The start of production on a new production line or on a previously discontinued production line.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by the manufacturer.</E> The manufacturer's quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested in accordance with the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory.</E> An independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the number of lots produced in a year is less than four. The inspections and tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no lots are produced during that period. If less than four lots are produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each reworked lot and the next lot of signals must not be counted for the purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Operational tests.</E> Each lot of signals must be sampled and tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria.</E> A sample of signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample must be the individual sample size in Table 160.022-4(c)(1) corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defects (Table 160.022-4(c)(2)) is <PRTPAGE P="55"/>assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance with that table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal. If the sum of all the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the lot is accepted. If this sum is equal to or more than the reject criterion the lot is rejected. If the cumulative failure percent falls between the accept and reject criteria, another sample is selected from the production lot and the operational tests are repeated. The cumulative failure percent of each sample tested is added to that of the previous samples to obtain the cumulative failure percent for all the signals tested (cumulative sample size). Additional samples are tested and the tests repeated until either the accept or reject criterion for the cumulative sample size is met. If any signal in the sample explodes when fired or ignited in a way that could burn or otherwise injure the person firing it, the lot is rejected without further testing. (This procedure is diagrammed in figure 160.022-4(c).)</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test Procedure.</E> Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Conditioning of test specimens—water-resistance.</E> Immerse specimens horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Smoke emitting time.</E> Ignite specimen according to the directions printed on the signal and place signal in tub or barrel of water. The smoke emitting time of a specimen shall be obtained by stop watch measurements from the time of distinct, sustained smoke emission until it ceases. The watch shall be stopped during periods of flame emission. The smoke emitting time for a specimen shall be not less than 4 minutes.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Ignition and smoke emitting characteristics.</E> Test specimens shall ignite and emit smoke properly when the directions on the signal are followed. Test specimens shall not ignite explosively in a manner that might be dangerous to the user or persons close by. Test specimens shall emit smoke at a uniform rate while floating in calm to rough water. Signals should be so constructed that water submerging the signal in moderately heavy seas will not cause it to become inoperative.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval tests.</E> The approval tests are those tests prescribed for the preproduction sample in MIL-S-18655. The approval tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Production inspections and tests.</E> Production inspections and tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the procedures in § 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and the results of the second test.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by the manufacturer.</E> The manufacturer's quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, to determine that signals are being produced in <PRTPAGE P="59"/>accordance with the approved plans. The manufacturer must select samples from each lot and test them as specified in the production lot procedures in MIL-S-18655.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory.</E> An independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under paragraph (b)(1) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the number of lots is less than four. The inspections and tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no lots are produced during this period. If less than four lots are produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and testing of each lot. If a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.</P>

The approval tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Production inspections and tests.</E> Production inspections and tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the procedures in § 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and the results of the second test.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Lot size.</E> For the purposes of sampling the production of signals, a lot must consist of not more than 30,000 signals. Lots must be numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started with: (i) Any change in construction details, (ii) any change in sources of raw materials, or (iii) the start of production on a new production line or on a previously discontinued production line.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by the manufacturer.</E> The manufacturer's quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested in accordance with the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory.</E> An independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and <PRTPAGE P="61"/>tests under paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the number of lots produced in a year is less than four. The inspections and tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no lots are produced during this period. If less than four lots are produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Operational tests.</E> Each lot of signals must be sampled and tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria.</E> A sample of signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample must be the individual sample size in Table 160.024-4(c)(1) corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defects. (Table 160.024-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance with the table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal. If the sum of all the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the lot is accepted. If this sum is equal to or more than the reject criterion the lot is rejected. If the cumulative failure percent falls between the accept and reject criteria, another sample is selected from the production lot and the operational tests are repeated. The cumulative failure percent of each sample tested is added to that of the previous samples to obtain the cumulative failure percent for all the signals tested (cumulative sample size). Additional samples are tested and the tests repeated until either the accept or reject criterion for the cumulative sample size is met. If any signal in the sample explodes when fired or ignites in a way that could burn or otherwise injure the person firing it, the lot is rejected without further testing. (This procedure is diagrammed in figure 160.024-4(c).)</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Conditioning of test specimens—water resistance.</E> Immerse specimen horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Firing and operating characteristics.</E> Signals shall fire and operate satisfactorily when shot from a pistol of the type described in subpart 160.028. The parachute and pyrotechnic candle shall be ejected at approximately the maximum altitude reached by the projectile case. The parachute shall open and properly suspend the pyrotechnic candle without fouling. The pyrotechnic candle shall burn with uniform intensity and without damaging the parachute, shrouds, or leader line.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Altitude.</E> The altitude reached by a signal is considered to be the height at which the parachute and pyrotechnic candle are ejected from the projectile case, as determined by visual observation against an object of known height, such as a tower or balloon, or by triangulation from two or more points of observation, or by other method satisfactory to the Commandant. The altitude reached shall be not less than 45 m (150 ft.).</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Rate of descent.</E> The rate of descent of a signal is considered to be the calculated average rate obtained by dividing the altitude by the time of descent to the surface. The rate of descent shall not exceed 1.8 m (6 ft.) per second.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Burning time.</E> The burning time of the pyrotechnic candle shall be obtained by stop watch measurement from the time distinct, sustained flame is emitted until it ceases. The burning time shall be not less than 30 seconds.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Technical tests.</E> Three signals must be subjected to each of the following tests. Two of the three signals must pass each test in order for the lot of signals to be accepted.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Luminous intensity.</E> The luminous intensity of each pyrotechnic candle tested shall be measured by a visual photometer or equivalent photometric device while the specimen is supported in a horizontal position and the photometer is at right angles to the axis of <PRTPAGE P="64"/>the specimen. Visual luminous intensity readings shall be observed and recorded at approximately 5-second intervals during the burning of the specimen. The minimum photometric distance shall be 3 m (10 ft.). Recording photometers shall have a chart speed of at least 10 cm (4 in.) per minute. The luminous intensity of the specimen shall be computed as the arithmetical average of the readings recorded. The average luminous intensity of a specimen shall be not less than 20,000 candela.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Elevated temperature, humidity, and storage.</E> Place specimen in a thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75 °C. with not less than 90 percent relative humidity for 72 hours. Remove specimen and store at room temperature (20° to 25 °C.) with approximately 65 percent relative humidity for 10 days. If for any reason it is not possible to operate the oven continuously for the 72-hour period, it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity for 8 hours out of each 24 during the 72-hour conditioning period. (Total of 24 hours on and 48 hours off.) The signal shall not ignite or decompose during this conditioning. The signal shall fire and operate satisfactorily following this conditioning.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Spontaneous ignition.</E> Place the specimen in a thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75 °C. with not more than 10% relative humidity for 48 consecutive hours. The signal shall not ignite or undergo marked decomposition.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Chromaticity.</E> The color of the burning signal must be vivid red as defined by Sections 13 and 14 of the “Color Names Dictionary.” Two identical test plates of white cardboard about 30 cm × 60 cm (12″ × 24″) are used. Except for a negligible amount of stray daylight, the first test plate is illuminated by light from the specimen placed at a distance of about 1.5 cm (5 ft.). The second test plate is illuminated only by light from an incandescent lamp operated at a color temperature close to 2,848° K at a distance of about 30 cm (1 ft.). The first plate is viewed directly, the second through combinations of lovibond red, yellow, and blue glasses selected so as to approximate a chromaticity match. By separating the test plates by a wide unilluminated area (subtending at the observer about 45°), it is possible to make accurate determinations of chromaticity in terms of the 1931 CIE Standard Observer and Coordinate System, in spite of fluctuations in luminous intensity of the specimen by factors as high as 2 or 3. The CIE coordinates are converted to the Munsell notation which is cross-referenced to the color name in Section 13 of the “Color Names Dictionary” (see the discussion in section 10 of “the Universal Color Language”).</P>

                <PRTPAGE P="68"/>
                <GID>EC03MR91.008</GID>
              </GPH>

              <P>(1) A lattice type platform must be of western red cedar, port orford cedar, sitka spruce, northern white pine, or southern cypress slats constructed on an oak frame. The slats must have nominal cross-section dimensions not less than 90 mm (3<FR>5/8</FR> in.) by 9.5 mm (<FR>3/8</FR> in.). The frame members must have <PRTPAGE P="69"/>nominal cross-section dimensions not less than 100 mm (4 in.) by 12.5 mm (<FR>1/2</FR> in.). The space between adjacent slats must not exceed the width of the slats. The space between each frame member and the adjacent slat must not exceed twice the width of the slats. The platform must be riveted together at each intersection of—</P>
              <P>(i) Frame members,</P>
              <P>(ii) Slats, and</P>
              <P>(iii) Frame members and slats.</P>
              <P>(2) A plywood platform must be made of exterior or marine type plywood with surfaces that are either “A” or “B” grade as commonly designated in the plywood industry. Holes 35 mm (1<FR>3/8</FR> in.) to 50 mm (2 in.) in diameter must be drilled through the platform. The number of holes must be at least the number equal to (L-25) (W-25)/225, where L is the length of the platform in cm and W is the width of the platform in cm. (The formula is (L-10)(W-10)/36 where L and W are measured in inches.) The thickness of the plywood must be at least—</P>
              <P>(i) 12.5 mm (<FR>1/2</FR> in.) for life floats of 10 persons capacity and under,</P>
              <P>(ii) 16 mm (<FR>5/8</FR> in.) for life floats between 11 and 25 persons capacity inclusive, and</P>
              <P>(iii) 19 mm (<FR>3/4</FR> in.) for life floats of 26 persons capacity and over.</P>
              <P>(3) A platform of construction differing from that described in either (1) or (2) of this paragraph will be approved if it has holes to permit the passage of water and if it passes the tests in § 160.027-7. The number of holes must be the same as required for a plywood platform. If the platform is netting on a frame, the netting must be constructed of cordage with a breaking strength of at least 1600 N (355 lb.). The netting must be constructed on not more than 5 cm (2 in.) centers and must be knotted together at each point where the lines intersect.</P>
              <P>(c) Each platform must be of a material that is resistant to deterioration by exposure to weather or must have a surface that protects it from deterioration by exposure to weather. For a wood platform, this surface must be at least two coats of water resistant spar varnish, or two coats of marine paint.</P>
              <P>(d) Each part of the platform, including surfaces, edges, and rivets must be smooth and must not have cutting edges, points, or splinters which would be dangerous for bare feet.</P>
              <P>(e) The platform must be arranged so that under normal stowed conditions, it can be retained in the center of the float and can be readily released from this position for use.</P>
              <P>(f) The platform must be suspended from the body of the float by a net or an equivalent arrangement, which when fully extended, holds the top of the platform approximately 900 mm (36 in.) below the center of the float body.</P>
              <P>(1) The net must be constructed of cordage with a minimum breaking strength of 1600 N (355 lb.). The net must be attached to the platform through holes on centers that do not exceed 165 mm (6<FR>1/2</FR> in.).</P>
              <P>(2) If the platform is suspended from the body of the float by an arrangement other than a net as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the arrangement must be of equivalent to the net in terms of strength, resistance to tangling, and allowing the platform to freely pass through the center of the life float body.</P>

              <P>(a) The tests in this section are for life float platforms that do not meet the requirements of either § 160.027-3(b) (1) or (2).</P>
              <P>(b) The float body must be supported so that the platform is suspended in the air by the net or equivalent supporting arrangement. The platform must be loaded evenly with a weight equal to 60 percent of the weight of the total number of persons for which the float is to be rated, assuming a weight of 75 kg (165 lb.) per person. The weight must be allowed to remain on the platform for ten minutes after which it is removed. The supporting arrangement and platform must not show any evidence of damage or permanent deformation as a result of this test.</P>

              <P>(c) The float body must be supported so that the platform is suspended in the air by the net or equivalent supporting arrangement. A bag of sand, shot or similar granular material weighing 90 kg (200 lb.) must be dropped onto the center of the platform <PRTPAGE P="70"/>from a height of 3 m (10 ft.). The supporting arrangement and platform must not show any damage that would affect the serviceability of the float or platform.</P>

              <P>(d) As part of the buoyancy test required in § 160.010-7(e) of this chapter, the platform must be loaded with weights equal to <FR>1/2</FR> the rated capacity of the float. There must be no damage to the supporting arrangement or platform as a result of this test.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Materials.</E> The materials used in handheld rocket-propelled parachute red flare distress signals shall conform strictly to the specifications and drawings submitted by the manufacturer and approved by the Commandant. In general, all exposed parts shall be corrosion-resistant or properly protected against corrosion.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Workmanship.</E> Handheld rocket-propelled parachute red flare distress signals shall be of first class workmanship and shall be free from imperfections of manufacture affecting their appearance or that may affect their serviceability.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 160.036-4</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Approval and production tests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval tests.</E> The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least 100 signals from which samples must be taken for testing for approval under § 160.036-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Production inspections and tests.</E> Production inspections and tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the procedures in § 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot must not be represented as meeting this Subpart or as being approved by the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and the results of the second test.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Lot size.</E> For the purposes of sampling the production of signals, a lot must consist of not more than 30,000 signals. Lots must be numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started with:</P>
              <P>(i) Any change in construction details,</P>
              <P>(ii) Any changes in sources of raw materials, or</P>
              <P>(iii) The start of production on a new production line or on a previously discontinued production line.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by the manufacturer.</E> The manufacturer's quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested in accordance with the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Inspections and test by an independent laboratory.</E> An independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the number of lots produced in a year is less than four. The inspections and tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no lots are produced during this period. If less than four lots are produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Operational tests.</E> Each lot of signals must be sampled and tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria.</E> A sample of signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample must be the individual sample size in Table 160.036-4(c)(1) corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defects (Table 160.036-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance with that table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal. If the sum of all the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the lot is accepted. If this sum is equal to or more than the <PRTPAGE P="77"/>reject criterion the lot is rejected. If the cumulative failure percent falls between the accept and reject criteria, another sample is selected from the production lot and the operational tests are repeated. The cumulative failure percent of each sample tested is added to that of the previous samples to obtain the cumulative failure percent for all the signals tested (cumulative sample size). Additional samples are tested and the tests repeated until either the accept or reject criterion for the cumulative sample size is met. If any signal in the sample explodes when fired or ignites in a way that could burn or otherwise injure the person firing it, the lot is rejected without further testing. (This procedure is diagrammed in figure 160.036-4(c)).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Conditioning of test specimens—water resistant.</E> Immerse specimen horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Firing and operating characteristics.</E> Signals shall fire and operate satisfactorily when the manufacturer's directions are followed. The parachute and pyrotechnic candle shall be ejected at approximately the maximum altitude reached by the projectile case. The parachute shall open and properly suspend the pyrotechnic candle without fouling. The pyrotechnic candle shall burn with uniform intensity and without damaging the parachute, shrouds, or leader line.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Altitude.</E> The altitude reached by a signal is considered to be the height at which the parachute and pyrotechnic candle are ejected from the projectile case, as determined by visual observation against an object of known height, such as a tower or balloon, or by triangulation from two or more points of observation, or by other method satisfactory to the Commandant. The altitude reached shall be not less than 150 m (500 ft.).</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Rate of descent.</E> The rate of descent of a signal is considered to be the calculated average rate obtained by dividing the altitude by the time of descent to the surface. The rate of descent shall not exceed 4.5 m (15 ft.) per second.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Burning time.</E> The burning time of the pyrotechnic candle shall be obtained by stop watch measurement from the time a distinct, sustained flame is emitted until it ceases. The burning time shall be not less than 30 seconds.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Technical tests.</E> Three signals must be subjected to each of the following tests. Two of the three signals must pass each test in order for the lot of signals to be accepted.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Luminous intensity.</E> The luminous intensity of each pyrotechnic candle <PRTPAGE P="80"/>tested shall be measured by a visual photometer or equivalent photometric device while the specimen is supported in a horizontal position and the photometer is at right angles to the axis of the specimen. Visual luminous intensity readings shall be observed and recorded at approximately 5-second intervals during the burning of the specimen. The minimum photometric distance shall be 3 m (10 ft.). Recording photometers shall have a chart speed of at least 10 cm (4 in.) per minute. The luminous intensity of the specimen shall be computed as the arithmetical average of the readings recorded. The average luminous intensity of a specimen shall be not less than 20,000 candela.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Elevated temperature, humidity, and storage.</E> Place specimen in a thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75 °C. with not less than 90 percent relative humidity for 72 hours. Remove specimen and store at room temperature (20° to 25 °C.) with approximately 65 percent relative humidity for ten days. If for any reason it is not possible to operate the oven continuously for the 72-hour period, it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity for 8 hours out of each 24 during the 72-hour conditioning period. (Total of 24 hours on and 48 hours off.) The signal shall not ignite or decompose during this conditioning. The signal shall fire and operate satisfactorily following this conditioning.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Spontaneous ignition.</E> Place the specimen in a thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75 °C. with not more than 10% relative humidity for 48 consecutive hours. The signal shall not ignite or undergo marked decomposition.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Chromaticity.</E> The color of the burning signal must be vivid red as defined by Sections 13 and 14 of the “Color Names Dictionary.” Two identical test plates of white cardboard about 30 cm × 60 cm (12″ × 24″) are used. Except for a negligible amount of stray daylight, the first test plate is illuminated by light from the specimen placed at a distance of about 1.5 m (5 ft.). The second test plate is illuminated only by light from an incandescent lamp operated at a color temperature close to 2,848° K at a distance of about 30 cm (1 ft.). The first plate is viewed directly, the second through combinations of Lovibond red, yellow, and blue glasses selected so as to approximate a chromaticity match. By separating the test plates by a wide unilluminated area (subtending at the observer about 45°), it is possible to make accurate determinations of chromaticity in terms of the 1931 CIE Standard Observer and Coordinate System, in spite of fluctuations in luminous intensity of the specimen by factors as high as 2 or 3. The CIE coordinates are converted to the Munsell notation which is cross-referenced to the color name in Section 13 of the “Color Names Dictionary” (see the discussion in Section 10 of “The Universal Color Language”).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Type.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Hand orange smoke distress signals specified by this subpart shall be one type which shall consist essentially of a wooden handle to which is attached a tubular casing having a sealing plug at the handle end, the casing being filled with a smoke producing composition and fuse with button of ignition material at the top, and a removable cap having a friction striking material on its top which may be exposed for use by pulling a tear strip. The signal is ignited by scraping the friction striker on top of the cap against the igniter button on top of the body of the signal. Alternate arrangements which conform to the performance requirements of this specification will be given special consideration.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Materials, workmanship, construction, and performance requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Materials.</E> The materials shall conform strictly to the specifications and drawings submitted by the manufacturer and approved by the Commandant. The color of the tube shall be orange. The combustible materials shall be of such nature as will not deteriorate during long storage, nor when subjected to frigid or tropical climates, or both.<PRTPAGE P="82"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Workmanship.</E> Hand orange smoke distress signals shall be of first class workmanship and shall be free from imperfections of manufacture affecting their appearance or that may affect their serviceability. Moisture proof coatings shall be applied uniformly and shall be free from pinholes or other visible defects which would impair their usefulness.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Construction.</E> The casing shall be fitted and secured to the handle with not less than a 25 mm (1 in.) overlap and shall be attached to the handle in such a manner that failure of the joint will not occur during tests, ignition, or operation. The plug shall be securely affixed in the casing to separate the smoke composition from the wooden handle. The smoke composition shall be thoroughly mixed and be uniformly compressed throughout to preclude variations of density which may adversely affect uniformity of its smoke emitting characteristics. The cap shall have a lap fit of not less than 25 mm (1 in.) over the end of the casing and smoke composition to entirely and securely protect the exposed surface of the igniter button and end of smoke composition and casing, and shall have an inner shoulder so constructed that it is mechanically impossible for the inner surface of the cap to come in contact with the igniter button. The cap shall be securely attached to the casing in such manner as to preclude its accidental detachment. The cap shall be provided on its top with a friction striking material which shall, by a pull of the tear strip, be entirely exposed for striking the friction igniter button. The igniter button shall be non-water soluble or be protected from moisture by a coating of some waterproof substance, and shall be raised or exposed in such manner as to provide positive ignition by the friction striker. The igniter button shall be firmly secured in or on the top of the smoke composition; the arrangement shall be such that the ignition will be transmitted to the smoke producing composition. The assembled signal, consisting of tear strip, cap, casing, and handle, shall be sealed and treated to protect the signal from deterioration by moisture. The protective waterproof coating shall be applied so none adheres to the friction striking surface. Special consideration will be given to alternate waterproofing of the signal by means of a water-resistant coating on the signal plus packaging in a sealed plastic waterproof bag satisfactory to the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Performance.</E> Signals shall meet all the inspection and test requirements contained in § 160.037-4.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 160.037-4</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Approval and production tests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval tests.</E> The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least 100 signals from which samples must be taken for testing for approval under § 160.037-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Production inspections and tests.</E> Production inspections and tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the procedures in § 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and the results of the second test.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Lot size.</E> For the purposes of sampling the production of signals, a lot must consist of not more than 30,000 signals. Lots must be numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started with:</P>
              <P>(i) Any change in construction details,</P>
              <P>(ii) Any change in sources of raw materials, or</P>
              <P>(iii) The start of production on a new production line or on a previously discontinued production line.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by the manufacturer.</E> The manufacturer's quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering into <PRTPAGE P="83"/>construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested in accordance with the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory.</E> An independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this Chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the number of lots produced in a year is less than four. The inspections and tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no lots are produced during this period. If less than four lots are produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Operational tests.</E> Each lot of signals must be sampled and tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria.</E> A sample of signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample must be the individual sample size in Table 160.037-4(c)(1) corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defeats (Table 160.037-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance with that table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal. If the sum of all the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the lot is accepted. If the sum is equal to or more than the reject criterion the lot is rejected. If the cumulative failure percent falls between the accept and reject criteria, another sample is selected from the production lot and the operational tests are repeated. The cumulative failure percent of each sample tested is added to that of the previous samples to obtain the cumulative failure percent for all the signals tested (cumulative sample size). Additional samples are tested and the tests repeated until either the accept or reject criterion for the cumulative sample size is met. If any signal in the sample explodes when fired, or ignites in a way that could burn or otherwise injure the person firing it, the lot is rejected without further testing. (This procedure is diagrammed in figure 160.037-4(c)).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Conditioning of test specimens—water resistance.</E> Immerse specimen horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours. If the signal is protected by alternate waterproofing consisting of a water-resistant coating on the signal plus packaging in a sealed plastic waterproof bag, the 24-hour water immersion conditioning will be conducted while the signal is in the sealed plastic waterproof bag and will be followed by an additional immersion of the bare signal (i.e., after removal from the bag) 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 10 minutes.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Waterproofing of igniter button.</E> Remove the cap from the test specimen. Place head of specimen without cap about 25 mm (1 in.) under the surface of water for approximately 5 minutes. Remove specimen from the water and wipe dry.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Smoke emitting time.</E> Ignite specimen according to directions printed on the signal. The smoke emitting time of a specimen shall be obtained by stop watch measurements from the time of distinct, sustained smoke emission until it ceases. The watch shall be <PRTPAGE P="84"/>stopped during periods of flame emission. The smoke emitting time for a specimen shall be not less than 50 seconds.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Ignition and smoke emitting characteristics.</E> Test specimens shall ignite and emit smoke properly when the directions on the signal are followed. Test specimens shall not ignite explosively in a manner that might be dangerous to the user or persons close by. The plug separating the smoke producing composition from the handle shall in no case allow flame or hot gases to pass through it or between it and the casing in such manner as might burn the hand while holding the signal by the handle.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Production inspections and tests.</E> Production inspections and tests must be conducted under the procedures in § 159.007 of this chapter. Each appliance or lot of rockets which fails the inspections and tests must not be represented <PRTPAGE P="90"/>as meeting this subpart or as being approved by the Coast Guard.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by the manufacturer.</E> The manufacturer's quality control procedures must include the inspection of appliances during production as well as inspection of finished appliances, to determine that the appliances are being produced in accordance with the approved plans. The performance tests in paragraph (c) of this section must be performed by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory.</E> An independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this chapter must inspect and test appliances and rockets at least once each year. The inspection must determine that the appliances and rockets are being produced in accordance with the appropriate plans. The tests must be in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Performance tests</E>—(1) <E T="03">Appliances.</E> Each appliance shall be tested by firing three rounds. These rounds may be regular rockets or buoyant type rockets carrying regular service lines, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this paragraph or may be dummy projectiles, of the same size and weight as the regular rocket projectile, expelled into an earthen bank or other resisting medium from a reasonable distance. At least one of the rounds shall be fired using a primer-ejector cartridge loaded with a charge double the normal charge; the other rounds may be fired using regular primer-ejector cartridges. After the firing tests have been completed, each appliance shall be fired twice using the regular primer-ejector cartridges only, for the purposes of demonstrating that the appliance is still in operating condition. The entire assembly of the appliance shall then be examined. Results of the test firing and the physical examination shall show none of the following: Failure to eject cartridge, failure to close breech, trigger malfunction, safety lock failure to function, breech catch malfunction, broken spring, broken handgrips, cracked barrel or discharge chamber, firing pin or plunger broken, distorted or excessively worn or loose breech. A single misfire is acceptable if a second cartridge fires on repeated test. Misfire of both shall be cause for rejection of the appliance. More than one loose screw shall be cause for rejection. If an appliance exhibits a single loose screw, it may be retightened.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Rockets.</E> The rocket shall utilize a solid fuel propellant which shall function in accordance with all applicable requirements of MIL-R-23139. The use of black powder for the rocket motor is not acceptable. The ignition of the rocket motor shall occur at such a distance from the appliance so as not to spew flame, hot gaseous exhaust, or hot particles of propellant in such a manner as to create a hazard to personnel or the vessel. The rocket shall have a service line carrier assembly permanently attached and made of material, or suitably protected, to withstand the heat from the rocket motor's exhaust. From each 200 rockets manufactured, not less than three must be selected to be tested by firing with service line attached. The rockets selected will, over a period of time, include representative samples of both the regular and buoyant type rockets, except that the approval test must include both types. The line shall be carried, under conditions of reasonably still atmosphere, a minimum of 230 m (750 ft.), without breaking or fouling the line, and the rocket shall alight not more than 15 m (50 ft.) from either side of the target line. In no case shall a test rocket be fired without a line attached. After a buoyant type rocket is fired, it shall demonstrate its ability to float in water for not less than 2 hours. Failure to meet any of the test requirements, nose cone cracks, rupture in flight, erratic flight, or unusual burning rate, shall be cause for rejection of rockets produced until suitable correction has been made. If rockets selected from this lot are used for the tests required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section this may be accepted as meeting the requirements of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Primer-ejector cartridges.</E> Inasmuch as primer-ejector cartridges are used for the tests required by paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this paragraph, additional tests of primer-ejector cartridges will be made only when deemed advisable by the independent laboratory. Misfiring or failure of any kind shall be <PRTPAGE P="91"/>cause for rejection of cartridges produced until suitable correction has been made.</P>

The thickness of metal in the container shall be at least equal to 20 USSG and all seams and joints shall be welded or brazed. Either the body or the cover shall contain a gasket of molded rubber or other material which will give a suitable watertight seal, and the mating piece shall be flanged or turned to form an effective bearing surface. The cover shall be fastened to the body by two positive closed type pull-down snap fasteners on one edge, which together with two positive open type pull-down snap fasteners at the opposite edge, and one positive open type pull-down snap fastener at each of the other two edges, shall effectively hold the bearing surfaces together to provide the required watertight closure. The container shall be capable of being opened and reclosed watertight.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Handle.</E> A suitable carrying handle, approximately 3″ × 1<FR>1/4</FR>″, of 0.125″ diameter steel wire, shall be securely mounted on the side or end of the body of the container, and be so arranged that when laid flat against the container it will not project beyond either the upper or lower edge, and shall provide ample finger clearance for carrying.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Cover fasteners.</E> The cover fasteners shall be of the pull-down, draw bolt type or equivalent and of sufficient size and strength for the purpose. The fasteners shall be so constructed as not to jar loose by vibration, but to permit easy and quick opening with one hand. There may be no sharp edges and all parts shall be adequately protected against corrosion.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This specification covers buoyant vests which essentially consist of a vest-cut envelope containing compartments in which are enclosed pads of buoyant material arranged and distributed so as to provide the proper flotation characteristics and buoyancy required to hold the wearer in an upright backward position with head and face out of water. The buoyant vests are also fitted with tapes, webbing, and hardware to provide for proper adjustment and close and comfortable fit to the bodies of various size wearers.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Envelope.</E> The envelope or cover shall be cut to the pattern shown on Dwg. No. 160.047-1, Sheet 1, for adult size, and Sheets 2 and 3 for child sizes, and sewed with seams and stitching as shown on the drawing. Three compartments shall be formed to hold the buoyant pad inserts, two front compartments and one back compartment, and reinforcing strips of the same material as the cover shall be stitched to the inside of the front compartments in way of the strap attachments as shown by the drawings. As alternate construction, the front and/or back cover panels may be made in two pieces, provided that the two pieces are joined by a double stitched seam from the top center of the neck hole to the top of the vest as shown in Section J-J of the drawings.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Pad inserts</E>—(1) <E T="03">Forming and sealing.</E> The buoyant pad inserts shall each be formed from two pieces of film cut to the patterns shown by Dwg. No. 160.047-1, Sheet 4, which shall be heat-sealed tight. The heat-sealed pad seams shall show an adhesion of not less than 8 pounds when 1 inch strips cut across and perpendicular to the seams are pulled apart at a rate of separation of the clamping jaws of the test machine of 12 inches per minute.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Kapok-filled pads for Models AK-1, CKM-1, and CKS-1.</E> The buoyant pad inserts for Models AK-1, CKM-1, and CKS-1 buoyant vests shall be filled with kapok distributed as provided in Table 160.047-4(c)(2).<PRTPAGE P="101"/>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This specification covers buoyant cushions of the box type filled with kapok or fibrous glass contained in heat-sealed vinyl film pad covers which are inserted in an outer cover fitted with grab straps. The primary purpose of such cushions is to provide buoyancy to aid a person in keeping afloat in the water. No hooks, snaps, or other means shall be included which might facilitate fastening the cushion to a boat. Buoyant cushions shall be of such size and volume as to provide not less than 20 pounds buoyancy when tested in the manner described in § 160.048-5(e), but no cushion providing less than 225 square inches of top surface area or measuring less than 2 inches or more than 3 inches in thickness will be acceptable.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Cover.</E> One piece of material each for the top and bottom shall be <PRTPAGE P="105"/>stitched together to form the cover except that piecing of the cover material will be allowed provided it is for decorative purposes only. Gusset or boxing materials shall be of not more than two pieces. If more than one piece of material is used for the top, bottom, boxing or gusset, they shall be attached by a double row of stitching of the type shown in Federal Standard No. 751, for seam types SSw-2 or LS(b)-2. The top and bottom may be of any of the materials permitted for the cover, but the boxing or gusset shall be a cotton fabric as specified by § 160.048-3(c)(1) or other equivalent material of a porous nature. Nonporous materials will not be permitted for the boxing or gusset, but coated upholstery cloth specified by § 160.048-3(d)(2), perforated to permit adequate draining and drying will be acceptable.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Buoyant material.</E> Buoyant cushions shall be filled with the minimum amounts of kapok or fibrous glass determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Rectangular buoyant cushions 2 inches thick shall be filled with the amounts of kapok or fibrous glass indicated for the various widths and lengths of such cushions by Table 160.048-4(c)(1)(i) or 160.048-4(c)(1)(ii), as applicable. Trapezoidal buoyant cushions 2 inches thick shall be filled with the amounts of kapok or fibrous glass indicated for the various widths and lengths of rectangular buoyant cushions by Table 160.048-4(c)(1)(i) or 160.048-4(c)(1)(ii) as applicable, on the basis that the length of a trapezoidal cushion shall be considered as its average length in each case.</P>

The heat-sealed pad seams shall show an adhesion of not less than 8 pounds when one inch strips cut across and perpendicular to the seams are pulled apart at a rate of separation of the clamping jaws of the test machine of 12 inches per minute. Each cushion shall contain not less than four pads and all pads in a cushion shall contain approximately equal portions of the total amount of buoyant material in the cushion. The buoyant material may be inserted directly into the vinyl film pad covers, or may first be packed in bags made of print cloth or other suitable material and then inserted into the vinyl film pad covers. The pads shall be of such size as to adequately fill the outer cover, and prior to sealing, the pads shall be evacuated of air sufficiently that when sat on the pads will not “balloon” excessively because of the pressure in the pad covers. For 15″ × 15″ × 2″ cushions the four vinyl film pad covers shall each be cut approximately 12″ wide × 12″ long or approximately 8″ wide × 18″ long shall have a sealed area of approximately 125 square inches; shall contain not less than 5 ounces of kapok or 9 ounces of fibrous glass each; and the volume displacement of the individual heat-sealed pad inserts shall be 5<FR>1/2</FR> pounds each, plus or minus <FR>1/2</FR> pound, when tested in accordance with the method set forth in § 160.048-5(e)(1), except that the pad covers shall not be slit open, and the period of submergence shall be only long enough to determine the displacement of the pads.</P>

Other means will be given special consideration.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Seams and stitching.</E> Seams shall be constructed with not less than a <FR>3/8</FR> inch border between the seam and the edge of the cover materials. All stitching shall be a lock stitch, 7 to 9 stitches per inch, except as follows: Chain stitching 6 to 8 stitches per inch, with 20/4 thread on top and 40/3 thread on the bottom, will be acceptable in constructing straps.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Workmanship.</E> All cushions shall be of first class workmanship and shall be free from defects materially affecting their appearance or serviceability. Cushions classified as “seconds” or “irregular” will not be acceptable under this specification.</P>

Securely attach the spring scale in a position directly over the test tank. Suspend the weighted wire basket from the scale in such a manner that the basket is weighed while it is completely under water. In order to measure the actual buoyancy provided by the pads, the underwater weight of the empty basket should exceed the buoyancy of the pads.

              <P>(i) Weigh the empty wire basket under water.</P>
              <P>(ii) Place the pads inside the basket and submerge it so that the top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water for 24 hours. The tank shall be locked or sealed during this 24-hour submergence period. It is important that after the pads have once been submerged that they shall remain submerged for the duration of the test, and at no time during the course of the test shall they be removed from the tank or otherwise exposed to air.</P>
              <P>(iii) After the 24-hour submergence period unlock or unseal the tank and weigh the weighted wire basket with the pads inside while both are still under water.</P>
              <P>(iv) The buoyancy is computed as (i) minus (iii).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This specification covers buoyant cushions of the box type filled with unicellular plastic foam buoyant <PRTPAGE P="111"/>material. Such cushions consist essentially of a buoyant insert contained in an outer cover fitted with grab straps. The primary purpose of such cushions is to provide buoyancy to aid a person in keeping afloat in the water. Buoyant cushions providing less than 20 pounds buoyancy or less than 2 inches in thickness will not be acceptable.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Cover.</E> One piece of material each for the top and bottom shall be stitched together to form the cover except that piecing of the cover material will be allowed provided it is for decorative purposes only. Gusset or boxing materials shall be of not more than two pieces. If more than one piece of material is used for the top, bottom, boxing or gusset, they shall be attached by a double row of stitching of the type shown in Federal Standard No. 751, for Seam types SSw-2 or LSb-2. The top and bottom may be of any of the materials permitted for the cover, but the boxing or gusset shall be a cotton fabric as specified by § 160.049-3(b)(1) or other equivalent material of a porous nature. Nonporous materials will not be permitted for the boxing or gusset, but coated upholstery cloth specified by § 160.049-3(c)(2), perforated to permit adequate draining and drying will be acceptable.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Buoyant material.</E> A buoyant insert for a buoyant cushion must comply with the requirements in paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section and may be:</P>
              <P>(1) Molded in one piece; or</P>
              <P>(2) Built up from sheet material if it is formed from:</P>
              <P>(i) Three pieces or less in each layer, cemented together with an all-purpose vinyl adhesive such as or equivalent to U.S. Rubber No. M-6256 or Minnesota Mining No. EC-870 and No. EC-1070;</P>
              <P>(ii) Three layers or less that may be cemented; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Staggered butts and seams of adjacent layers.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Grab Straps.</E> Grab straps shall be attached as shown on Dwg. No. 160,049-1 and shall finish 20 inches long and 1 inch wide at opposite ends. The grab straps, if formed from cover material shall be folded and stitched together so as to produce a double thickness with raw edges turned under. Other means will be given special consideration.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Seams and stitching.</E> Seams shall be constructed with not less than a <FR>3/8</FR>-inch border between the seam and the edge of the cover materials. All stitching shall be a lock stitch, 7 to 9 stitches per inch, except as follows: Chain stitching 6 to 8 stitches per inch with 20/4 thread on top and 40/3 thread on the bottom, will be acceptable in constructing grab straps.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Workmanship.</E> All cushions shall be of first class workmanship and shall be free from defects materially affecting their appearance or serviceability. Cushions classified as “seconds” or “irregular” will not be acceptable under this specification.</P>

In order to measure the actual buoyancy provided by the cushion, the underwater weight of the empty basket should exceed the buoyancy of the cushion. To obtain the buoyancy of the cushion, proceed as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Weigh the empty wire basket under water.</P>
              <P>(ii) Place the cushion inside the basket and submerge it so that the top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water for 24 hours. The tank shall be locked or sealed during this 24-hour submergence period. It is important that after the cushion has once been submerged that it shall remain submerged for the duration of the test, and at no time during the course of the test shall it be removed from the tank or otherwise exposed to air.</P>
              <P>(iii) After the 24-hour submergence period unlock or unseal the tank and weigh the weighted wire basket with the cushion inside while both are still under water.</P>
              <P>(iv) The buoyancy is computed as (i) minus (iii).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Construction and workmanship.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This specification covers ring life buoys which provide buoyancy to aid in keeping persons afloat in the water. Each buoy consists of a body constructed in the shape of an annular ring, with an approximately elliptical body cross section and which is fitted with a grab line around the outside periphery. The outside and inside diameters of the ring and the length and width of the cross section of the body shall be uniform throughout.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Body.</E> The body shall be made in either one or two pieces. If of two pieces, the pieces shall be equal in size and shall be adhesive bonded along a center line through an axis passing through the flat area dimension of the body. The adhesive shall be a liquid cold setting, polymerizable, nonsolvent, containing material of the phenolepichlorhydrin type or equivalent having good strength retention under outdoor weathering conditions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Grab line.</E> The finished length of the grab line shall be four times the outside diameter of the buoy. The ends of the grab line shall be securely and neatly spliced together, or shall be hand whipped with a needle and both ends securely and smoothly seized together. The grab line shall encircle the buoy and shall be held in place by the beckets. The spliced or seized ends of the grab line shall be placed in the center of the width of one of the beckets.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Beckets.</E> Each ring buoy shall be fitted with four beckets located at equidistant points about the body of the buoy. The beckets shall be passed around the body of the buoy with the free ends to the outside, and shall be securely cemented to the buoy with a suitable waterproof adhesive which is compatible with the unicellular plastic used in the buoy body. The ends of the beckets shall be turned under at least 1 inch, one end to go around the grab line, and the other to be laid flat against the first end. The beckets shall then be stitched to the grab line with not less than five hand stitches made with two parts of thread or machined stitched with not less than three stitches per inch. Alternate methods for rigging beckets and grab line will be given special consideration.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Weight.</E> The weight of the completely assembled buoy shall be not less than 2.5 pounds and not more than 4.25 pounds for the 20-inch size, not less than 3.0 pounds and not more than 5.5 pounds for the 24-inch size, and not less than 5.0 and not more than 7.5 pounds for the 30-inch size.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Workmanship.</E> Ring life buoys shall be of first class workmanship and free from any defects materially affecting their appearance or serviceability.</P>

              <P>(i) Weigh the empty wire basket under water.</P>
              <P>(ii) Place the inserts inside the basket and submerge it so that the top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water. Allow the inserts to remain submerged for 24 hours. The tank shall be locked or sealed during this 24-hour submergence period. It is important that after the inserts have once been submerged they shall remain submerged for the duration of the test, and at no time during the course of the test shall they be removed from the tank or otherwise exposed to air.</P>
              <P>(iii) After the 24-hour submergence period, unlock or unseal the tank and weigh the wire basket with the inserts inside while both are still under water.</P>
              <P>(iv) The buoyancy is computed as paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section minus paragraph (e)(i)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Buoyancy required.</E> The buoyant inserts from adult size buoyant vests shall provide not less than 15<FR>1/2</FR> pounds buoyancy in fresh water; the inserts from child medium size vests shall provide not less than 11 pounds buoyancy; and the inserts from child small size vests shall provide not less than 7 pounds buoyancy.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Body strap test.</E> The complete body strap assembly including hardware, shall be tested for strength by attaching the dee ring to a suitable support such that the assembly hangs vertically its full length. A weight as specified in § 160.052-3(d) shall be attached to the other end of the snap hook for 10 minutes. The specified weight shall not break or excessively distort the body strap assembly.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Additional approval tests for nonstandard vests.</E> Tests in addition to those required by this section may be conducted by the inspector for nonstandard vests to determine performance equivalence to a standard vest. Such additional tests may include determining performance in water, suitability of materials, donning time, ease of adjustment, and similar equivalency tests. Costs of any additional tests must be assumed by the manufacturer.</P>

Suspend the weighted wire basket from the scale in such a manner that the basket can be weighed while it is completely under water. In order to measure the actual buoyancy provided by the inserts, the underwater weight of the empty basket should exceed the buoyancy of the inserts. To obtain the buoyancy of the inserts, proceed as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Weigh the empty wire basket under water.</P>
              <P>(ii) Place the inserts inside the basket and submerge it so that the top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water. Allow the inserts to remain submerged for 24 hours. The tank shall be locked or sealed during this 24-hour submergence period.</P>
              <P>(iii) After the 24-hour submergence period, unlock the tank and weigh the wire basket with the inserts inside while both are still under water.</P>
              <P>(iv) The buoyancy is computed as paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section minus paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 160.057-4</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Approval and production tests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval tests.</E> The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least 20 signals from which samples must be taken for testing for approval under § 160.057-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Production inspections and tests.</E> Production inspections and tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the procedures in § 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and the results of the second test.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Lot size.</E> For the purposes of sampling the production of signals, a lot must consist of not more than 1,200 signals. Lots must be numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started with: (i) Any change in construction details, (ii) any change in sources of raw materials, or (iii) the start of production on a new production line or on a previously discontinued production line.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by the manufacturer.</E> The manufacturer's quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals, to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested in accordance with the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="137"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory.</E> An independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under § 159.010 of this chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the number of lots produced in a year is less than four. The inspections and tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no lots are produced during that period. If less than four lots are produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Operational tests.</E> Each lot of signals must be sampled and tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sampling procedure and accept/reject criteria.</E> A sample of signals must be selected at random from the lot. The size of the sample must be the individual sample size in Table 160.057-4(c)(1) corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defects (Table 160.057-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance with that table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal If the sum of all the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the lot is accepted. If this sum is equal to or more than the reject criterion the lot is rejected.</P>
              <FP>If the cumulative failure percent falls between the accept and reject criteria, another sample is selected from the production lot and the operational tests are repeated. The cumulative failure percent of each sample tested is added to that of the previous samples to obtain the cumulative failure percent for all the signals tested (cumulative sample size). Additional samples are tested and the tests repeated until either the accept or reject criterion for the cumulative sample size is met. If any signal in the sample explodes when fired, or ignites in a way that could burn or otherwise injure the person firing it, the lot is rejected without further testing. (This procedure is diagrammed in figure 160.057-4(c)).</FP>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Conditioning of test specimens—water resistance.</E> Immerse specimen horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately 25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Smoke emitting time.</E> Ignite specimen according to the directions printed on the signal and place signal in tub or barrel of water. The smoke emitting time of a specimen shall be obtained by stop watch measurements from the time of distinct, sustained smoke emission until it ceases. There shall be no flame emission during the entire smoke emitting time of the signal. The smoke emitting time for a specimen shall not be less than 15 minutes. When the tests are performed or supervised by an independent laboratory, this test shall be conducted with approximately 6 mm (<FR>1/4</FR> in.) of gasoline covering the water in the tub or barrel. The gasoline vapors shall not ignite during the entire smoke emitting time of the signal.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Ignition and smoke emitting characteristics.</E> Test specimens shall ignite and emit smoke properly when the directions on the signal are followed. Test specimens shall not ignite explosively in a manner that might be dangerous to the user or persons close by. Test specimens shall emit smoke at a uniform rate while floating in calm to rough water. Signals should be so constructed that water submerging the signal in moderately heavy seas will not cause it to become inoperable.<PRTPAGE P="138"/>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Technical tests.</E> One signal must be subjected to each of the following tests. Each signal must pass the test in order for the lot of signals to be accepted.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Drop test.</E> One signal must be attached to a ring life buoy and arranged <PRTPAGE P="140"/>to be ignited by the dropping buoy in the same manner as it would be when used on a vessel. The signal and buoy must be mounted at least 27 m (90 ft.) above the surface of a body of water. The buoy is released and must cause the signal to ignite and fall to the water with the buoy. The signal must remain afloat and emit smoke at least 15 minutes.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Wave test.</E> A signal shall be tested in a manner simulating its use at sea. The signal shall be ignited and thrown overboard under conditions where waves are at least 30 cm (1 ft.) high. The smoke emitting time must be for the full 15 minutes and the signal shall float in such a manner that it shall function properly during this test. The signal shall be attached to a ring life buoy in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Underwater smoke emission.</E> Condition the signal in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Ignite specimen and let it burn about 15 seconds in air. Submerge the burning signal in water in a vertical position with head down. Obtain underwater smoke emission time by stop watch measurements from time of submersion until smoke emission ceases. The test specimen shall emit smoke under water not less than 30 seconds when subjected to this test.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Elevated Temperature, Humidity and Storage.</E> Place specimen in a thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75 °C. with not less than 90 percent relative humidity for 72 hours. Remove specimen and store at room temperature (20° to 25 °C.) with approximately 65 percent relative humidity for 10 days. If for any reason it is not possible to operate the oven continuously for the 72-hour period, it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity for 8 hours out of each 24 during the 72-hour conditioning period. (Total of 24 hours on and 48 hours off.) The signal shall not ignite or decompose during this conditioning. The signal shall ignite and operate satisfactorily following this conditioning.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Spontaneous ignition.</E> Place the specimen in a thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75 °C. with not more than 10% relative humidity for 48 consecutive hours. The signal must not ignite or undergo marked decomposition.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Susceptibility to explosion.</E> Remove smoke composition from signal and punch a small hole in the composition. Insert a No. 6 commercial blasting cap. Ignite the cap. The test specimen shall not explode or ignite.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Corrosion resistance.</E> Expose the complete specimen with cover secured hand-tight to a finely divided spray of 20 percent by weight sodium chloride solution at a temperature between 32 °C and 38 °C (90 °F and 100 °F) for 100 hours. The container and cap must not be corroded in any fashion that would impair their proper functioning.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Color of smoke.</E> Ignite specimen in the open air in daytime according to the directions printed on the signal, and determine the smoke color by direct visual comparison of the unshadowed portions of the smoke with a color chart held so as to receive the same daylight illumination as the unshadowed portions of the smoke. The color of the smoke must be orange as defined by sections 13 and 14 of the “Color Names Dictionary” (colors 34-39 and 48-54).</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Volume and density of smoke.</E> The test specimen shall show less than 70 percent transmission for not less than 12 minutes when measured with apparatus having a light path of 19 cm (7<FR>1/2</FR> in.), an optical system aperture of + 3.7 degrees, and an entrance air flow of 18.4m<SU>3</SU> per minute (650 cu. ft. per minute), such apparatus to be as described in National Bureau of Standards Report No. 4792.</P>

              <P>(i) Weigh the empty wire basket under water.</P>
              <P>(ii) Place the inserts inside the basket and submerge it so that the top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water. Allow the inserts to remain submerged for 24 hours. The tank shall be locked or sealed during this 24-hour submergence period. It is important that after the inserts have once been submerged they shall remain submerged for the duration of the test, and at no time during the course of the test shall they be removed from the tank or otherwise exposed to air.</P>

              <P>(iii) After the 24-hour submergence period, unlock or unseal the tank and weigh the wire basket with the inserts inside while both are still under water.<PRTPAGE P="146"/>

              <P>(a) The procedure for conducting operational tests is described in figure (1).</P>
              <P>(1) An “accept lot” decision must be reached in order to pass the operational tests.</P>
              <P>(2) If a “reject lot” decision is reached, the entire lot is rejected.</P>
              <P>(3) Signals from “reject lots” may be reworked by the manufacturer to correct the deficiency for which they were rejected and be resubmitted for inspection. Records shall be kept of the reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the “reject lot”, and the result of the second test. Signals from “reject lots” may not, unless subsequently accepted, be sold or offered for sale as being in compliance with this specification.</P>
              <P>(b) Each signal selected for the operational tests must be conditioned by:</P>
              <P>(1) Being submerged under at least 25 mm (1 in.) of water for 24 hours without any protection other than its waterproofing; or</P>
              <P>(2) If waterproofing is provided by a sealed plastic bag or other waterproof packaging, submersion under 25 mm (1 in.) of water for 24 hours in the packaging, followed immediately by submersion under 25 mm (1 in.) of water for 10 minutes with the signal removed from the packaging.</P>
              <P>(c) After each signal selected has undergone the conditioning required by paragraph (b) of this section it must be fired as described by the manufacturer's operating instructions. The following data as observed must be recorded for each signal:</P>
              <P>(1) Burning time of the pyrotechnic candle;</P>
              <P>(2) Color;</P>
              <P>(3) Whether the pyrotechnic candle burns out above, at, or below the level of launch.</P>
              <P>(d) A signal fails the operational tests if:</P>
              <P>(1) It fails to fire,</P>
              <P>(2) The pyrotechnic candle fails to ignite,</P>
              <P>(3) The pyrotechnic candle continues to burn after it falls back to the level of launch,</P>
              <P>(4) The observed color is other than vivid red, or</P>
              <P>(5) The burning time is less than 5.5 seconds.</P>
              <P>(e) A lot is rejected if a “reject lot” decision is reached using Figure (1) and Table 1 after completion of the operational tests.</P>

              <P>(iii) For ten days;</P>
              <P>(4) Then remove each signal from any sealed packaging and fire it.</P>
              <P>(5) The test sample fails the test if:</P>
              <P>(i) Any signal ignites or decomposes before firing;</P>
              <P>(ii) Any signal when fired malfunctions in a manner that would cause burns or injury to an unprotected person firing the signal, or;</P>
              <P>(iii) Two or more of the signals fail to project and ignite the pyrotechnic candle.</P>
              <P>(c) The Spontaneous Combustion Test must be performed in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(1) Select three signals from the remaining six signals and place them in a thermostatically controlled even temperature over for 48 hours at a temperature of 75 degrees C (167 degrees F).</P>
              <P>(2) The test sample fails the test if any signal ignites or decomposes during the test.</P>
              <P>(d) The Luminous Intensity and Chromaticity Test must be performed in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(1) Remove the pyrotechnic candle from the remaining three signals.</P>
              <P>(2) Ignite, measure, and record the intensity of the burning candle with a visual photometer or equivalent photometric device or automatic recorder:</P>
              <P>(i) While the specimen is supported in a horizontal position and the photometer is at right angles to the axis of the specimen,</P>
              <P>(ii) At a distance of at least 3 m (10 ft.).</P>
              <P>(3) Calculate the intensity of the candle as in § 160.066-7(c).</P>
              <P>(4) Measure and record the chromaticity of the burning candle as specified in § 160.021-4(d)(4).</P>
              <P>(5) The test sample fails the test if more than one signal has a luminous intensity of less than 10,000 candela, or more than one signal is not “vivid red”.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Production oversight.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Production tests and inspections must be conducted in accordance with this section and subpart 159.007 of this chapter unless the Commandant authorizes alternative tests and inspections. The Commandant may prescribe additional production tests and inspections necessary to maintain quality control and to monitor compliance with the requirements of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(b) Production oversight must be performed by the same laboratory that performs the approval tests unless the Commandant determines that the employees of an alternative laboratory have received training and have access <PRTPAGE P="170"/>to the same information as the inspectors of the laboratory that conducted the approval testing.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to responsibilities set out in part 159 of this chapter and the accepted Laboratory Follow-up Procedures, each manufacturer of an inflatable PFD and each recognized laboratory inspector shall comply with the following, as applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Manufacturer.</E> Each manufacturer must—</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, perform all required tests and examinations on each PFD lot before any required inspector's tests and inspection of the lot;</P>
              <P>(ii) Follow established procedures for maintaining quality control of the materials used, manufacturing operations, and the finished product;</P>
              <P>(iii) Implement a continuing program of employee training and a program for maintaining production and test equipment;</P>
              <P>(iv) Admit the inspector to any place in the factory where work is done on PFDs or component materials, and where parts or completed PFDs are stored;</P>
              <P>(v) Have an inspector observe the production methods used in producing the first PFD lot and observe any revisions in production methods made thereafter; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Allow the inspector to take samples of completed PFDs or of component materials for tests required by this subpart and for tests relating to the safety of the design.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Recognized laboratory oversight.</E> An inspector from a recognized laboratory shall oversee production in accordance with the MOU. During production oversight, the inspector shall not perform or supervise any production test or inspection unless—</P>
              <P>(i) The manufacturer has a valid approval certificate; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The inspector has first observed the manufacturer's production methods and any revisions to those methods.</P>
              <P>(3) The inspector must perform or supervise testing and inspection of at least one in each five lots of PFDs produced.</P>
              <P>(4) During each inspection, the inspector must check for compliance with the manufacturer's quality control procedures.</P>
              <P>(5) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, at least once each calendar quarter, the inspector must examine the manufacturer's records required by § 160.076-33 and observe the manufacturer perform each of the tests required by § 160.076-31(c).</P>
              <P>(6) If less than six lots are produced during a calendar year, only one lot inspection and one records' examination and test performance observation are required during that year. Each lot tested and inspected under paragraph (c)(3) of this section must be within seven lots of the previous lot inspected.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">PFD lots.</E> A lot number must be assigned to each group of PFDs produced. Lots must be numbered serially. A new lot must be started whenever any change in materials or a revision to a production method is made, and whenever any substantial discontinuity in the production process occurs. Changes in lots of component materials must be treated as changes in materials. The lot number assigned, along with the approval number, must enable the PFD manufacturer, by referring to the records required by this subpart, to determine the supplier of the components used in the PFD and the component supplier's identifying information for the component lot.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Samples.</E> For the tests, examinations, and inspections required by § 160.076-31, inspectors and manufacturers shall select samples as provided in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(1) Samples shall be selected at random from a lot in which all PFDs or materials in the lot are available for selection. Except as provided in § 160.076-31(c), samples must be selected from completed PFDs.</P>
              <P>(2) Different samples must be selected for the manufacturer's and inspector's tests, except, if the total production for any five consecutive lots does not exceed 250 PFDs, the manufacturer's and inspector's tests may be run on the same sample(s) at the same time.</P>

              <P>(3) The number of samples selected per lot must be at least equal to the applicable number required by Table 160.076-29A for manufacturers or Table 160.076-29B for inspectors.<PRTPAGE P="171"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The following additional requirements apply as indicated in Table 160.076-29A to individual sample selections by manufacturers:</P>
              <P>(i) Samples must be selected from each lot of incoming material. The tests required under paragraphs 160.076-25(d)(2)(i) through 160.076-25(d)(2)(iv) prescribe the number of samples to select.</P>
              <P>(i) Samples must be selected from each lot of incoming material. Unless otherwise specified, Table 29.1 of UL 1191 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.076-11) prescribes the number of samples to select.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a sample fails the over-pressure test, the number of samples to be tested in the next lot produced must be at least two percent of the total number of PFDs in the lot or 10 PFDs, whichever is greater.</P>
              <P>(iv) The indicated test must be conducted at least once each calendar quarter or whenever a new lot of material is used or a production process is revised.</P>
              <P>(5) The following additional requirements apply as indicated in Table 160.076-29B to individual sample selections by inspectors:</P>
              <P>(i) Samples selected for the indicated tests may not be used for more than one test.</P>
              <P>(ii) The indicated test may be omitted if it was conducted by the manufacturer on the materials used and by the inspector on a previous lot within the past 12 months.</P>
              <P>(iii) One sample of each means of marking on each type of fabric or finish used in PFD construction must be tested at least every six months or whenever a new lot of materials is used.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Production tests and examinations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Samples used in testing must be selected in accordance with § 160.076-29(e).</P>
              <P>(b) On each sample selected—</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer must conduct the tests in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(8) of this section;</P>
              <P>(2) The recognized laboratory inspector must conduct or supervise the tests in paragraphs (c)(4) through (c)(8) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(3) In addition to meeting the requirements of this section, each test result must meet the requirements, if any, contained in the approved plans and specifications.</P>
              <P>(c) When conducting the tests specified by this paragraph, the following conditions must be met:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Inflation chamber materials.</E> The materials in each inflatable chamber must comply with the requirements in Table 29.1 of UL 1191 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.076-11) for permeability, grab strength, and tear strength. Lots not meeting this requirement must be rejected and, unless authorized by the Commandant, may not be subdivided and retested.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Seam strength.</E> The seams in each inflation chamber of each sample must be tested in accordance with Table 29.1 of UL 1191.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Over-pressure.</E> Each sample must be tested in accordance with and meet UL 1180 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.076-11) section 41. Prior to initiating the test at the specified values, samples may be prestressed by inflating them to a greater pressure than the required test pressure.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Air retention.</E> Each sample must be tested in accordance with and meet UL 1180 section 42. Prior to initiating the test at the specified values, test samples may be prestressed by inflating to a pressure greater than the design pressure, but not exceeding 50 percent of the required pressure for the tests in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. No alternate test method may be used that decreases the length of the test unless authorized by the Commandant. Such alternative test must require a proportionately lower allowable pressure loss and the same percentage sensitivity and accuracy as the standard allowable loss measured with the standard instrumentation.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Buoyancy and inflation medium retention.</E> Each sample must be tested in <PRTPAGE P="173"/>accordance with and meet UL 1180 section 29. Each buoyancy value must fall within the tolerances specified in the approved plans and specifications.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Tensile strength.</E> Each sample primary closure system must be tested in accordance with and meet UL 1180 section 31.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Detailed product examination.</E> Each sample PFD must be disassembled to the extent necessary to determine compliance with the following:</P>
              <P>(i) All dimensions and seam allowances must be within tolerances prescribed in the approved plans and specifications.</P>
              <P>(ii) The torque of each screw type mechanical fastener must be within its tolerance as prescribed in the approved plans and specifications.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Accept/reject criteria.</E> Each nonconforming PFD must be rejected. If three or more nonconforming PFDs are rejected for the same kind of defect, lot examination or inspection must be discontinued and the lot rejected.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Manufacturer examination.</E> This examination must be conducted by a manufacturer's representative who is familiar with the approved plans and specifications, the functioning of the PFD and its components, and the production testing procedures. This person must not be responsible for meeting production schedules or be supervised by someone who is. This person must prepare and sign the record required by 159.007-13(a) of this chapter and 160.076-33(b).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Independent laboratory inspection.</E> (i) The inspector must discontinue lot inspection and reject the lot if examination of individual PFDs or the records for the lot shows noncompliance with either this section or the laboratory's or the manufacturer's quality control procedures.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the inspector rejects a lot, the inspector must advise the Commandant or the recognized laboratory within 15 days.</P>
              <P>(iii) The inspector must prepare and sign the inspection record required by 159.007-13(a) of this chapter and 160.076-33(b). If the lot passes, the record must include the inspector's certification that the lot passed inspection and that no evidence of noncompliance with this section was observed.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Disposition of rejected PFD lot or PFD.</E> (1) A rejected PFD lot may be resubmitted for testing, examination or inspection if the manufacturer first removes and destroys each defective PFD or, if authorized by the Commandant, reworks the lot to correct the defect.</P>
              <P>(2) Any PFD rejected in a final lot examination or inspection may be resubmitted for examination or inspection if all defects have been corrected and reexamination or reinspection is authorized by the Commandant.</P>

              <P>(3) A rejected lot or rejected PFD may not be sold or offered for sale under the representation that it meets <PRTPAGE P="174"/>this subpart or that it is Coast Guard-approved.</P>

              <P>(2) The Commandant may prescribe additional production tests and inspections if needed to maintain quality control and check for compliance with the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Test and Inspection Responsibilities.</E> In addition to responsibilities set out in part 159 of this chapter, each manufacturer of a hybrid PFD and each independent laboratory inspector must comply with the following, as applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Manufacturer.</E> Each manufacturer must—(i) Perform all required tests and examinations on each PFD lot before the independent laboratory inspector tests and inspects the lot, except as provided in § 160.077-23(d)(5);</P>
              <P>(ii) Perform required testing of each incoming lot of inflation chamber material before using that lot in production;</P>
              <P>(iii) Have procedures for maintaining quality control of the materials used, manufacturing operations, and the finished product;</P>
              <P>(iv) Have a continuing program of employee training and a program for maintaining production and test equipment;</P>
              <P>(v) Have an inspector from the independent laboratory observe the production methods used in producing the first PFD lot produced and observe any revisions made thereafter in production methods;</P>
              <P>(vi) Admit the inspector and any Coast Guard representative to any place in the factory where work is done on hybrid PFD's or component materials, and where completed PFD's are stored; and</P>
              <P>(vii) Allow the inspector and any Coast Guard representative to take samples of completed PFD's or of component materials for tests prescribed in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Independent Laboratory.</E> (i) An inspector may not perform or supervise any production test or inspection unless—</P>
              <P>(A) The manufacturer has a current approval certificate; and</P>
              <P>(B) The inspector has first observed the manufacturer's production methods and any revisions to those methods.</P>
              <P>(ii) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, an inspector must perform or supervise testing and inspection of at least one PFD lot in each five lots produced.</P>
              <P>(iii) During each inspection, the inspector must check for noncompliance with the manufacturer's quality control procedures.</P>
              <P>(iv) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, at least once each calendar quarter, the inspector must, as a check on the manufacturer's compliance with this section, examine the manufacturer's records required by § 160.077-25 and observe the manufacturer perform each of the tests required by paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) If less than six lots are produced during any calendar year, only one lot inspection in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, and one records examination and test performance observation in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section is required during that year. Each lot tested and inspected must be within seven lots of the previous lot inspected.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">PFD Lots.</E> A lot number must be assigned to each group of PFD's produced. No lot may exceed 1000 PFD's. A new lot must be started whenever any change in materials or a production method is made, or whenever any substantial discontinuity in the production process occurs. Changes in lots of component materials must be treated as changes in materials. Lots must be numbered serially. The lot number assigned, along with the approval number, must enable the PFD manufacturer, by referring to the records required by this subpart, to determine who produced the components used in the PFD.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Samples.</E> (1) Samples used in testing and inspections must be selected at <PRTPAGE P="186"/>random. Sampling must be done only when all PFD's or materials in the lot are available for selection.</P>
              <P>(2) Each sample PFD selected must be complete, unless otherwise specified in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Each adult test subject must have a freeboard of at least:</P>

                <P>The following types of PFDs are designed to perform as described in calm water and when the wearer is not wearing any other flotation material (such as a wetsuit).</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Type I</E>—A Type I PFD has the greatest required inherent buoyancy and turns most unconscious persons in the water from a face down position to a vertical and slightly backward position, therefore greatly increasing one's chances of survival. The Type I PFD is suitable for all waters, especially for cruising on waters where rescue may be slow coming, such as large bodies of water where it is not likely that boats will be nearby. This type PFD is the most effective of all types in rough water. It is reversible and available in only two sizes—Adult (over 40 kg (90 lb)) and child (less than 40 kg (90 lb)) which are universal sizes (designed for all persons in the appropriate category).
                </P>
                <FP>[<E T="03">Insert illustration of Type I PFD</E>]</FP>
                
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Type II</E>—A Type II PFD turns most wearers to a vertical and slightly backward position in the water. The turning action of a Type II PFD is less noticeable than the turning action of a Type I PFD and the Type II PFD will not turn as many persons under the same conditions as the Type I. The Type II PFD is usually more comfortable to wear than the Type I. This type of PFD is designed to fit a wide range of people for easy emergency use, and is available in the following sizes: Adult (over 40 kg (90 lb)), Medium Child (23-40 kg (50-90 lb)), and two categories of Small Child (less than 23 kg (50 lb) or less than 14 kg (30 lb). Additionally, some models are sized by chest sizes. You may prefer to use the Type II where there is a good chance of fast rescue, such as areas where it is common for other persons to be engaged in boating, fishing and other water activities.
                </P>

                <P>
                  <E T="03">Type III</E>—The Type III PFD allows the wearer to tilt backwards in the water, and the device will maintain the wearer in that position and will not turn the wearer face <PRTPAGE P="191"/>down. It is not designed to turn the wearer face up. A Type III is generally more comfortable than a Type II, comes in a variety of styles which should be matched to the individual use, and is often the best choice for water sports, such as skiing, hunting, fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. This type PFD normally comes in many chest sizes and weight ranges; however, some universal sizes are available. You may also prefer to use the Type III where there is a probability of quick rescue such as areas where it is common for other persons to be engaged in boating, fishing, and other water activities.

                <P>
                  <E T="03">Hybrid Inflatable Type I, II, or III</E>—A Type I, II, or III Hybrid PFD is an inflatable device which is the most comfortable PFD to wear and has a minimal amount of buoyancy when deflated and significantly increased buoyancy when inflated (See accompanying table for actual buoyancy for your Type of hybrid). When inflated it turns the wearer with the action of a Type I, II, or III PFD as indicated on its label. Boaters taking advantage of the extra comfort of hybrid inflatable PFDs must take additional care in the use of these devices. Boaters should test their hybrid PFDs in the water, under safe, controlled conditions to know how well the devices float them with limited buoyancy. Approximately 90 percent of boaters will float while wearing a Type II or III hybrid inflatable PFD when it is not inflated. However, hybrid inflatable PFDs are not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with enough additional inflation to float the wearer. Almost all boaters will float while wearing a Type I hybrid inflatable PFD that is not inflated. The PFD's ‘performance type’ indicates whether it should be used only where help is nearby, or if it also may be used where help may be slow coming. Type I hybrids are suitable where rescue may be slow coming, while Types II and III are good only when there is a chance of fast rescue. Type I hybrids are approved in three weight ranges, adult, for persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); youth, for persons weighing 23-40 kg (50-90 lb); and small child, for persons weighing 14-23 kg (30-50 lb). Type II hybrid PFDs are approved in the same size ranges as Type I hybrids but may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes. Type III hybrids are only approved in adult and youth sizes but may also be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes.

                <P>
                  <E T="03">Type IV</E>—A Type IV PFD is normally thrown or tossed to a person who has fallen overboard so that the person can grasp and hold the device until rescued. Until May 15, 1995 (or May 1, 1996 at commercial liveries), the Type IV is acceptable in place of a wearable device in certain instances. However, this type is suitable only where there is a good chance of quick rescue, such as areas where it is common for other persons to be nearby engaged in boating, fishing, and other water activities. It is not recommended for use by non-swimmers and children.

                <P>
                  <E T="03">Type V (General)</E>—A Type V PFD is a PFD approved for restricted uses or activities such as boardsailing, or commercial white water rafting. These PFDs are not suitable for other boating activities. The label on the PFD indicates the kinds of activities for which the PFD may be used and whether there are limitations on how it may be used.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Type V Hybrid</E>—A Type V Hybrid PFD is an inflatable device which can be the most comfortable and has very little buoyancy when it is not inflated, and considerably more buoyancy when it is inflated. In order for the device to count toward carriage requirements on recreational boats, it must be worn except when the boat is not underway or when the user is below deck. When inflated it turns the wearer similar to the action provided by a Type I, II, or III PFD (the type of performance is indicated on the label). This type of PFD is more comfortable because it is less bulky when it is not inflated. Boaters taking advantage of the extra comfort of hybrid inflatable PFDs must take additional care in the use of these devices. Boaters should test their hybrid PFDs in the water, under safe, controlled conditions to know how well the devices float them with limited buoyancy. Approximately 70 percent of boaters will float while wearing a Type V hybrid PFD when the device is not inflated. Therefore, it is not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with enough additional inflation to float the wearer. The PFD's “performance type” indicates whether it should be used only where help is nearby, or if it may also be used where help may be slow coming. This type of PFD is approved in two sizes, adult, for persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); and youth, for persons weighing 23-40 kg (50-90 lb), and may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes.

                <P>This PFD has limited inherent buoyancy which means YOU MAY HAVE TO INFLATE THIS PFD TO FLOAT, and its inflatable portion requires maintenance. While these PFDs are not required to be worn, if you have an accident or fall overboard, you are much more likely to survive if you are already wearing a PFD.</P>

                <P>There is only one way to find out if you will float while wearing the PFD when it is not inflated. That is to try this PFD in the water as explained in [<E T="03">insert reference to the section of the manual that discusses how to test the PFD</E>]. If you have not tested this device in accordance with these guidelines, the Coast Guard does not recommend its use.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Why Do You Need a PFD?</HD>
                <P>A PFD provides buoyancy to help keep your head above water and to help you stay face up. The average in-water-weight of an adult is only about 5 to 10 pounds. The buoyancy provided by most PFDs will support that weight in water. However, the hybrid Type I, II, or III PFD may be an exception. The uninflated buoyancy provided by this PFD may only float 90 percent of the boating public. This is because the inherent buoyancy has been reduced to make it more comfortable to wear. So, you may not float adequately without inflating the device. Once the device is inflated you will have a minimum of 22 lb of buoyancy for adult sizes, which should be more than enough to float everyone. (See table above [below] for the actual minimum buoyancy for different Types of hybrids.) Your body weight alone does not determine your in-water-weight. Since there is no simple method of determining your weight in water, you should try the device in the water in both its deflated and inflated condition.</P>

                <P>Your PFD won't help you if you don't have it on. It is well-known that most boating accidents occur on calm water during a clear sunny day. It is also true that in approximately 80 percent of all boating accident fatalities, the victim did not use a PFD. Don't wait until it's too late. Non-swimmers and children especially should wear their PFD at all times when on or near the water. Hybrid Type I, II, III or V PFDs are not recommended for non-swimmers unless inflated enough to float the wearer.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fabrication of prototype lifeboats for approval.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the manufacturer is notified that the information submitted in accordance with § 160.135-9 of this subpart is satisfactory to the Commandant, the manufacturer may proceed with fabrication of the prototype lifeboat as set forth in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless the Commandant directs otherwise, an independent laboratory must perform or witness, as appropriate, inspections, tests, and oversight required by this section. Prototype inspections and tests of a lifeboat must be carried out in accordance with the procedures for independent laboratory inspection in 46 CFR part 159, subpart 159.007 and in this section, unless the Commandant authorizes alternative tests and inspections. The Commandant may prescribe additional prototype tests and inspections necessary to maintain quality control and to monitor compliance with the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) Fabrication of a lifeboat must proceed in the following sequence:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer must arrange for an independent laboratory (or Coast Guard inspector if required under paragraph (b) of this section) to inspect, test, and oversee the lifeboat during its fabrication and prepare an inspection and test report meeting the requirements of 46 CFR 159.005-11.</P>
              <P>(2) The independent laboratory must make such inspections as are necessary to determine that the prototype is constructed by the methods and with the materials specified in the plans reviewed under § 160.135-9 of this subpart. By conducting at least one inspection during its construction, the independent laboratory must determine the prototype lifeboat conforms with those plans by inspecting—</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) Construction.</E> (A) FRP components of each prototype lifeboat outer hull and any FRP inner hull or liner components that are bonded or bolted to the outer hull must have a layup made of unpigmented clear resins so that details of construction are visible for inspection. Test panels representative of each prototype layup must be tested in accordance with MIL-P-17549D(SH) (incorporated by reference, see § 160.135-5 of this subpart). If an accepted MIL-R-21607E(SH) (incorporated by reference, see § 160.135-5 of this subpart) Grade B resin is used for the prototype lifeboat, additives for fire retardancy must not be used so that the laminate is translucent for inspection purposes. Any prototype test lifeboat with Grade B resins will not be marked in accordance with § 160.135-17 of this subpart for use as a production lifeboat regardless of the outcome of the performance tests. Whichever accepted resin the manufacturer decides to use for the prototype lifeboat, the same resin must be used in the production lifeboats.<PRTPAGE P="224"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) The hull, canopy, and major structural laminates of each prototype FRP lifeboat must be tested for resin content, ultimate flexural strength, and tensile strength. The test samples must be cut out from the prototype lifeboat, or be laid up at the same time, using the same procedures and by the same operators as the laminate used in the lifeboat. The number of samples used for each test, and the conditions and test methods used, must be as per the applicable test specified in this paragraph. The resin content must be determined as per ASTM D 2584 or ISO 1172 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.135-5 of this subpart). The flexural ultimate strength must be determined by ASTM D 790 method I (test condition “A”, flatwise, dry) or the corresponding ISO 14125 test method (incorporated by reference, see § 160.135-5 of this subpart). The tensile strength, lengthwise, must be determined as per ASTM D 638 or ISO 527 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.135-5 of this subpart).</P>

For a davit-launched liferaft, these tests must be preceded by the test described in IMO Revised recommendation on testing, as amended by Resolution MSC.295(87), part 2, paragraph 5.2.</P>
              <P>(e) The test described in IMO Revised recommendation on testing, as amended by Resolution MSC.295(87), Paragraph 2/5.1.5, must be conducted under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The test must last 1 hour, with a maximum allowable pressure drop of 5 percent after compensation for changes in ambient temperature and barometric pressure.</P>

              <P>(2) For each degree Celsius of rise in temperature, 0.385 kPa must be subtracted from the final pressure reading (0.031 psig per degree Fahrenheit). For each degree Celsius of drop in temperature, 0.385 kPa must be added to the final pressure reading (again, 0.031 psig per degree Fahrenheit).<PRTPAGE P="240"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) For each mm of mercury of rise in barometric pressure, 0.133 kPa must be added to the final temperature-corrected pressure reading (0.049 psig per 0.1 inch of mercury). For each mm of mercury of drop in barometric pressure, 0.133 kPa must be subtracted from the final temperature-corrected pressure reading (again, 0.049 psig per 0.1 inch of mercury). Corrections for changes in ambient barometric pressure are necessary only if a measuring instrument open to the atmosphere, such as a manometer, is used.</P>
              <P>(f) One liferaft from each lot of fewer than 30 liferafts, and two from each lot of 30 to 50 liferafts, must pass the test described in IMO Revised recommendation on testing, as amended by Resolution MSC.295(87), part 2, paragraphs 5.1.1 and 5.1.2. If any liferaft fails this test—</P>
              <P>(1) The reason for the failure must be determined;</P>
              <P>(2) Each liferaft in the lot must be examined for the defect and repaired if reparable, or scrapped if irreparable; and</P>
              <P>(3) The lot test must be repeated, including random selection of the liferaft or liferafts to be tested. If any liferafts from the lot have left the place of manufacture, they must be recalled for examination, repair, and testing as necessary; or else the required actions must take place at an approved servicing facility.</P>
              <P>(g) The manufacturer shall arrange for inspections by an accepted independent laboratory at least once in each calendar quarter in which production of liferafts approved by the Coast Guard takes place. The time and date of each inspection must be selected by the independent laboratory, to occur when completed liferafts are in the manufacturing facility and others are under construction. The manufacturer shall ensure that the inspector from the independent laboratory—</P>
              <P>(1) Conducts the inspection and witnesses the tests required by paragraph (f) of this section, and further conducts a visual inspection to verify that the liferafts are being made in accordance with the approved plans and the requirements of this subpart;</P>
              <P>(2) Examines the records of production inspections and tests for liferafts produced since the last inspection by an independent laboratory to verify that each required inspection and test has been carried out satisfactorily;</P>
              <P>(3) Conducts a design audit on at least one liferaft approved by the Coast Guard each year. If possible, different models of liferafts must be examined in the design audit from year to year. To retain Coast Guard approval, the manufacturer shall demonstrate to the inspector during each design audit that—</P>
              <P>(i) Each part used in the liferaft matches the part called for by the approved plans;</P>
              <P>(ii) Each part and subassembly are of the materials and components indicated on the approved plans or their bills of materials; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Each critical dimension is correct as shown either by measurement or by proper fit and function in the next-higher assembly.</P>
              <P>(h) The manufacturer must notify the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) whenever final production inspections and tests are to be performed so that the OCMI may assign a marine inspector to the factory to witness the applicable tests and to ensure that the quality assurance program of the manufacturer is satisfactory.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fabrication of prototype rescue boats and fast rescue boats for approval.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the manufacturer is notified that the information submitted in accordance with § 160.156-9 of this subpart is satisfactory to the Commandant, the manufacturer may proceed with fabrication of the prototype rescue boat as set forth in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless the Commandant directs otherwise, an independent laboratory must perform or witness, as appropriate, inspections, tests, and oversight required by this section. Prototype inspections and tests of a rescue boat must be carried out in accordance with the procedures for independent laboratory inspection in 46 CFR part 159, subpart 159.007 and in this section, unless the Commandant authorizes alternative tests and inspections. The Commandant may prescribe additional prototype tests and inspections necessary to maintain quality control and to monitor compliance with the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) Fabrication of a rescue boat must proceed in the following sequence:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer must arrange for an independent laboratory (or Coast Guard inspector if required under paragraph (b) of this section) to inspect, test, and oversee the rescue boat during its fabrication and prepare an inspection and test report meeting the requirements of 46 CFR 159.005-11.</P>
              <P>(2) The independent laboratory must make such inspections as are necessary to determine that the prototype is constructed by the methods and with the materials specified in the plans reviewed under § 160.156-9 of this subpart. By conducting at least one inspection during its construction, the independent laboratory must determine the prototype rescue boat conforms with those plans by inspecting—</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) Construction.</E> (A) FRP components of each prototype rescue boat outer hull and any FRP inner hull or liner components that are bonded or bolted to the outer hull must have a layup made of unpigmented clear resins so that details of construction are visible for inspection. Test panels representative of each prototype layup must be tested in accordance with MIL-P-17549D(SH) (incorporated by reference, see § 160.156-5 of this subpart). If an accepted MIL-R-21607E(SH) Grade B resin is used for the prototype rescue boat, additives for fire retardancy must not be used so that the laminate is translucent for inspection purposes. A prototype test rescue boat with Grade B resins will not be marked in accordance with § 160.156-17 of this subpart for use as a production rescue boat regardless of the outcome of the performance tests. Whichever accepted resin the manufacturer decides to use for the prototype rescue boat, the same resin must be used in the production rescue boats.</P>
              <P>(B) The hull, canopy, and major structural laminates of each prototype FRP rescue boat must be tested for resin content, ultimate flexural strength, and tensile strength. The test samples must be cut out from the prototype rescue boat, or be laid up at the same time, using the same procedures and by the same operators as the laminate used in the rescue boat. The number of samples used for each test, and the conditions and test methods used, must be as per the applicable test specified in this paragraph. The resin content must be determined as per ASTM D 2584 or ISO 1172 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.156-5 of this subpart). The flexural ultimate strength must be determined by ASTM D 790 method I (test condition “A”, flatwise, dry) or the corresponding ISO 14125 test method (incorporated by reference, see § 160.156-5 of this subpart). The tensile strength, lengthwise, must be determined as per ASTM D 638 or ISO 527 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.156-5 of this subpart).</P>
              <P>(C) Each major FRP component, such as the hull, canopy, and inner liner(s) of each prototype FRP rescue boat, must be examined and weighed after it is completed but before it is assembled. If the rescue boat is constructed by the spray lay-up technique, the hull and canopy thicknesses must be measured using ultrasonic or equivalent techniques;</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Steel construction.</E> Steel sheet and plate used for the hull, floors, and other structural components of a prototype steel rescue boat must meet the bend tests requirement specified under ASTM A 653 (incorporated by reference, <PRTPAGE P="258"/>see § 160.156-5 of this subpart) after galvanizing or other anti-corrosion treatment has been applied. This may be demonstrated through supplier's certification papers or through witnessing actual tests;</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Welding.</E> Structural components of each prototype rescue boat joined by welding must be joined by the welding procedures and materials per the plans reviewed under § 160.156-9 of this subpart and by welders appropriately qualified;</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Buoyancy material.</E> If block foam buoyancy material is used, each piece must be weighed after it is cut and shaped to make sure that the correct amount of foam is installed. If foamed-in-place buoyancy material is used, a separate sample of the foam must be poured, and used to make a density determination after it has set. The density must be 32 ±8 kg/m<SU>3</SU> (2 ±0.5 lb/ft<SU>3</SU>). Each major subassembly such as the hull-with-liner and canopy-with-liner must be weighed after the buoyancy foam is installed and before it is further assembled;</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Coated fabric.</E> Coated fabric for inflatable collars used in the construction of each rescue boat must meet the requirements specified under § 160.156-7(b)(3) of this subpart. This may be demonstrated through a supplier's certification papers or through witnessing actual tests;</P>
              <P>(vi) Installation of the propulsion system; and</P>
              <P>(vii) Installation of the steering system.</P>
              <P>(3) The independent laboratory must submit the inspection report to the Commandant.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Approval testing for adult size immersion suit.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Caution: During each of the in-water tests prescribed in this section, a person ready to render assistance when needed should be near each subject in the water.<PRTPAGE P="275"/>
              </P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> An adult size immersion suit must be tested as prescribed in this section. If the suit is also made in a child size, a child size suit must be tested as prescribed in § 160.171-19. If the suit is also made in an oversize adult size, an oversize adult suit must be tested as prescribed in § 160.171-17(g) to determine the measured buoyancy for the suit. No additional testing will be required if the oversize adult suit is of the same design as the adult suit except for extra material to provide for larger persons.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Test samples.</E> Each test prescribed in this section may be performed by using as many immersion suits as needed to make efficient use of the test subjects and test equipment, except that each subject in the impact test described in § 160.171-17(c)(11) must not use more than one suit during the test, and the suits used in the impact test must also be used in the thermal protection test described in § 160.171-17(d).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Mobility and flotation tests.</E> The mobility and flotation capabilities of each immersion suit must be tested under the following conditions and procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Test subjects.</E> Seven males and three females must be used in the tests described in this paragraph. The subjects must represent each of the three physical types (ectomorphic, endomorphic, and mesomorphic). Each subject must be in good health. The heaviest subject, of either sex, must weigh at least 135 kg (298 lb.). The heaviest male subject must weigh at least 115 kg (254 lb.) and the lightest male subject must weigh not more than 55 kg (121 lb). The heaviest female subject must weigh at least 115 kg (254 lb.) and the lightest female subject must weigh not more than 55 kg (121 lb). Each subject must be unfamiliar with the specific suit under test. Each subject must wear a standard range of clothing consisting of:</P>
              <P>(i) Underwear (short sleeved, short legged);</P>
              <P>(ii) Shirt (long sleeved);</P>
              <P>(iii) Trousers (not woolen);</P>
              <P>(iv) Woolen or equivalent synthetic socks;</P>
              <P>(v) Rubber soled work shoes.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Donning time.</E> Each subject is removed from the view of the other subjects and allowed one minute to examine a suit and the manufacturer's instructions for donning and use of the suit in an emergency. At the end of this period, the subject attempts to don the suit as rapidly as possible without the aid of a chair or any support to lean on. If the subject does not don the suit completely, including gloves and any other accessories, within two minutes, the subject removes the suit and is given a demonstration of correct donning, and again attempts to don the suit. At least nine of the ten subjects must be able to don the suit completely, including time to remove shoes if necessary, in two minutes in at least one of the two attempts.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Field of vision.</E> The immersion suit's field of vision must be tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) While wearing a suit, each subject sits upright and faces straight ahead. An observer is positioned to one side of the subject at an angle of 60° away from the subject's straight-ahead line of sight. The observer must be able to see the subject's closest eye at this position. The observer then walks past the front of the subject to a position on the subject's other side that is at an angle of 60° away from the subject's straight-ahead line of sight. The suit must not obstruct the observer's view of the subject's eyes at any point between the two positions.</P>
              <P>(ii) While wearing the suit, each subject stands upright and faces straight ahead. An observer is positioned to one side of the subject at an angle of 90° away from the subject's straight-ahead line of sight. The subject then turns his or her head through an arc of 30° toward the position of the observer. This procedure is repeated with the observer positioned on the other side of the subject at an angle of 90° away from the subject's straight ahead line of sight. The suit must not obstruct the observer's view of the subject's eyes when the subject's head is turned 30° toward the observer.</P>

              <P>(iii) While wearing the suit, each subject stands upright and faces straight ahead. Through a combination of head and eye movement, the subject looks first at a spot directly overhead, then looks at a spot on or between the feet. <PRTPAGE P="276"/>An observer must verify that the subject can make the necessary head and eye movements while wearing the suit.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Hand dexterity.</E> A physician must always be present during this test. While wearing a suit, including a removable glove if any, and after being immersed in water at 5 °C (41 °F) for a period of one hour, each subject must be able to pick up a 9.5 mm (<FR>3/8</FR> in.) diameter wooden pencil from a flat hard surfaced table using only one hand. Still using only one hand, the subject must be able to position the pencil and write with it. At least eight of the ten test subjects must be able to complete this test. This test may be performed in conjunction with the thermal protection test described in § 160.171-17(d), in which case five of the six test subjects specified in § 160.171-17(d)(1) must be able to complete the test.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Walking.</E> A 30 m (100 ft.) long walking course must be laid out on a smooth linoleum floor. The finish on the floor must allow water to lie on it in a sheet rather than in beads. The course may have gradual turns, but must not have any abrupt change in direction. Each subject is timed walking the course two times at a normal pace with the floor dry. Each subject then dons a suit and is timed again walking the course two times with the floor wet. The subject is given adequate rest between trials to avoid fatigue. The subject must not slip on the wet floor when wearing the suit. The average time for each subject to walk the course while wearing the suit must be not more than 1.25 times the subject's average time to walk the course without the suit.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Climbing.</E> A vertical ladder extending at least 5 meters (17 feet) above a level floor must be used for this test. Each subject is timed climbing the ladder twice to a rung at least 3 meters (10 feet) above the floor. The subject then dons a suit and is again timed climbing to the same rung twice. The subject is given adequate rest between trials to avoid fatigue. The average time for each subject to climb the ladder while wearing the suit must not be more than 1.25 times the subject's average time to climb the ladder without the suit.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Swimming and water emergence test.</E> A pool with an inflatable liferaft at one side must be used for this test. The liferaft must be of a type approved under Subpart 160.051 of this Chapter and must not have a boarding ramp. Each subject, wearing a life preserver but not the immersion suit, enters the water and swims 25 m. The subject must then be able to emerge from the pool onto the liferaft using only the hands placed on top of the liferaft as an aid and without pushing off of the bottom of the pool. Any subject unable to emerge onto the liferaft within 30 seconds is disqualified for this test. At least five subjects must qualify and be used for this test. If less than five subjects of the original ten qualify, substitute subjects must be used. Each qualified subject, after sufficient rest to avoid fatigue, repeats this test wearing an immersion suit instead of the life preserver. At least two-thirds of the qualified subjects must be able to swim this distance, and emerge onto the liferaft within 30 seconds, wearing the immersion suit.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Stability and retroreflective material.</E> While wearing the suit in water without any auxiliary means of buoyancy, each subject assumes a face-up position and then allows his or her body to become limp. The distance from the water surface to the lowest part of the subject's mouth or nose is measured. This procedure is repeated using the auxiliary means of buoyancy, if one is provided. For each test subject, the stable position and the distance of the mouth and nose above the water must be prescribed in § 160.171-11(a)(2) and § 160.171-11(a)(3). During this test, each subject must be viewed by observers to determine whether the retroreflective material of the suit meets § 160.171-9(n).</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Righting.</E> Each subject while wearing a suit in water, without the use of any auxiliary means of buoyancy, takes a deep breath, assumes a face-down position, allows his or her body to become limp, and slowly expels air. The suit must cause the subject to turn to a position where the face is clear of the water within 5 seconds; or if the suit does not turn the subject within 5 seconds, the subject must be able to turn face up under his or her own power within 5 seconds. If the suit is <PRTPAGE P="277"/>provided with any means of auxiliary buoyancy, the procedure is repeated under each of the following applicable conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) With any means of auxiliary buoyancy attached but not inflated;</P>
              <P>(ii) With any means of auxiliary buoyancy which must be inflated by the wearer inflated according to the instructions; or</P>
              <P>(iii) With any means of auxiliary buoyancy which inflates automatically inflated by its automatic mechanism.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Water and air penetration.</E> Each subject is weighed while wearing a pre-wetted suit without any auxiliary means of buoyancy. The subject jumps into water from a height that will cause the subject to be completely immersed. The subject swims or treads water for approximately one minute, emerges from the water, and is weighed within 10 seconds after emerging. The procedure is repeated with the subject entering the water headfirst. If air accumulates in the legs as the subject enters the water head-first, it must be expelled automatically. At the end of this test, the weight of the subject in the suit must not exceed the weight of the subject in the suit at the beginning of the test by more than 500 grams. Each test subject then re-enters the water and floats for a period of one hour. The subject then emerges from the water and is weighed within 10 seconds. The weight of the subject in the suit at the end of this test must not exceed the weight of the subject in the suit at the beginning of the period of flotation by more than 200 grams.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Impact.</E> While wearing a suit without any auxiliary means of buoyancy, each subject jumps into water feet first six times from a height of 4.5 m (15 ft.) above the water surface. Each subject must be able to assume a face up stable position without assistance after each jump. The suit must not tear, separate at any seam, or exhibit any characteristic that could render it unsafe or unsuitable for use in water.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Thermal protection.</E> The thermal protection capability of a suit must be tested under the following conditions and procedures;</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Test subjects.</E> Male subjects must be used for this test. Each subject must be familiarized with the test procedure before starting the test. Each subject must have somatotype parameters within the following ranges according to the Heath-Carter anthropometric method: endomorphy 3.5±1.0; mesomorphy 4.0±1.5; ectomorphy 3.5±1.0.

              <FP>Each subject must have had a normal night's sleep before the test, a well-balanced meal 1 to 5 hours before the test, and no alcoholic beverages for 24 hours before the test. In addition to the suit, each subject must wear:</FP>
              <P>(i) Underwear (short sleeved, short legged);</P>
              <P>(ii) Shirt (long sleeved);</P>
              <P>(ii) Trousers (not woolen);</P>
              <P>(iv) Woolen or equivalent synthetic socks;</P>
              <P>(v) Work shoes, if the suit is designed for shoes to be worn inside.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test equipment.</E> The test must be conducted in calm water with a temperature between 0 °C (32 °F) and 2 °C (35.6 °F). The air temperature 300 mm (1 ft.) above the water surface must be between minus 10 °C (14 °F) and 20 °C (68 °F). Each subject must be instrumented with an electrocardiograph, a thermistor or thermocouple in the rectum placed 150 mm (6 in) beyond the anus, thermistor or thermocouple in the lumbar region, a thermistor or thermocouple on the tip of the index finger, and a thermistor or thermocouple on the tip of the great toe. Each thermistor or thermocouple must have an accuracy of 0.1 °C (0.18 °F). The suits used in this test must be the same ones previously subjected to the impact test described in § 160.171-17(c)(11).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> A physician must always be present during this test. Before donning the suit, each subject rests quietly in a room with a temperature between 10 °C (50 °F) and 25 °C (77 °F) for 15 minutes. The rectal temperature is then recorded as the initial rectal temperature. The subject dons a suit as rapidly as possible without <PRTPAGE P="278"/>damaging the instrumentation and immediately enters the water. The subject assumes a face-up, stable floating position. No auxiliary means of buoyancy may be used during this test. The subject remains in the water engaging in activity that maintains the heart rate between 50 and 140 per minute for the first hour, and between 50 and 120 per minute during the remainder of the test, except that no attempt is made to control heart rate if the subject is shivering. Each thermistor or thermocouple reading is recorded at least every 10 minutes.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Completion of testing.</E> Testing of a subject ends six hours after he first enters the water, unless terminated sooner.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Termination of test.</E> Testing of a subject must be terminated before completion if any of the following occurs:</P>
              <P>(i) The physician determines that the subject should not continue.</P>
              <P>(ii) The subject requests termination due to discomfort or illness.</P>
              <P>(iii) The subject's rectal temperature drops more than 2 °C (3.6 °F) below the initial rectal temperature, unless the physician determines that the subject may continue.</P>
              <P>(iv) The subject's lumbar, finger, or toe temperature drops below 10 °C (50 °F), unless the physician determines that the subject may continue.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Test results.</E> The test results must be prepared as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The total rectal temperature drop during the test period and the average lumbar, finger and toe temperature at the end of the test must be determined for each subject in the test, except subjects who did not complete testing for a reason stated in paragraph (d)(5)(i) or (d)(5)(ii) of this section. These temperatures and temperature drops must then be averaged. The average drop in rectal temperature must not be more than 2 °C (3.6 °F), and the average lumbar, toe and finger temperature must not be less than 5 °C (41 °F). Data from at least four subjects must be used in making these temperature calculations.</P>
              <P>(ii) Rates of toe, finger, lumbar, and rectal temperature drop for each subject who did not complete testing for a reason stated in paragraph (d)(5)(iii) or (d)(5)(iv) of this section must be determined using the highest temperature measured and the temperature measured immediately before testing was terminated. These rates must be used to extrapolate to 6 hours the estimated rectal, finger, lumbar, and toe temperature at the end of that time. These estimated temperatures must be the temperatures used in computing the average temperatures described in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Insulation.</E> Suit material must be tested under the following conditions and procedures, except that if the suit material meets the requirements for the control sample in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, the test procedure in paragraph (e)(2) of this section is not required.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Test equipment.</E> The following equipment is required for this test:</P>
              <P>(i) A sealed copper or aluminum can that has at least two parallel flat surfaces and that contains at least two liters (two quarts) or water and no air. One possible configuration of the can shown in figure 160.171-17(e)(1)(i).</P>
              <P>(ii) A thermistor or thermocouple that has an accuracy of ±0.1 °C (±0.18 °F) and that is arranged to measure the temperature of the water in the can.</P>
              <P>(iii) A control sample of two flat pieces of 4.75 mm (3/16 in.) thick, closed cell neoprene foam of sufficient size to enclose the can between them. The control sample must have a thermal conductivity of not more than 0.055 watt/meter−° K (0.38 Btu−in./hr.−sq.ft.− °F). The thermal conductivity of the control sample must be determined in accordance with the procedures in ASTM C 177 or ASTM C 518 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.171-3).</P>
              <P>(iv) Two flat pieces of suit material of sufficient size to enclose the can between them. The surface covering, surface treatment, and number of layers of the material tested must be the same as those of material used in the suit. If the material used in the suit varies in thickness or number of layers, the material tested must be representative of the portion of the suit having the least thickness or number of layers.</P>

              <P>(v) A clamping arrangement to form a watertight seal around the edges of <PRTPAGE P="279"/>the material when the can is enclosed inside. A sealing compound may be used. Figure 160.171-17(e)(1)(v) shows one possible arrangement of the clamping arrangement.</P>
              <P>(vi) A container of water deep enough to hold the entire assembly of the can, material, and clamp at least 1 meter (39 in.) below the surface of the water.</P>
              <P>(vii) A means to control the temperature of the water in the container between 0 °C (32 °F) and 1 °C (33.8 °F).</P>
              <P>(viii) A thermistor or thermocouple that has an accuracy of ±0.1 °C (0.18 °F) and that is arranged to measure the temperature of the water in the container at the depth at which the can, material, and clamp are held.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> The can is held under water (which can be at room temperature) and clamped between the two pieces of the neoprene control sample so that the assembly formed conforms as closely as possible to the shape of the can, and so that water fills all void spaces between the can and the sample. When the water temperature in the can is at or above 45 °C (113 °F), the assembly is then placed in the container and submerged to a depth of 1 m (39 in.) at the highest point of the assembly. The water temperature in the container must be between 0 °C (32 °F) and 1 °C (33.8 °F) and must be maintained within this range for the remainder of the test. No part of the assembly may touch the bottom or sides of the container. Every two minutes the assembly is shaken and then inverted from its previous position. The time for the water inside the can to drop from 45 °C (113 °F) to 33 °C (91 °F) is recorded. This procedure is performed three times using the control sample and then repeated three times using the suit material instead of the control sample. The shortest time for the drop in water temperature when the suit material is used must be greater than or equal to the shortest time when the neoprene control sample is used.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Storage temperature.</E> Two samples of the immersion suits, in their storage cases, must be alternately subjected to surrounding temperatures of −30 °C to + 65 °C. These alternating cycles need not follow immediately after each other and the following procedure, repeated for a total of ten cycles, is acceptable:</P>
              <P>(1) 8 hours conditioning at 65 °C to be completed in one day;</P>
              <P>(2) The specimens removed from the warm chamber that same day and left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day;</P>
              <P>(3) 8 hours conditioning at −30 °C to be completed the next day; and</P>
              <P>(4) The specimens removed from the cold chamber that same day and left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day. At the conclusion of the final cycle of cold storage, two test subjects who successfully completed the donning test in paragraph (c)(2) of this section enter the cold chamber, unpack and don the immersion suits. Alternatively, the suits may be unpacked in the chamber, then removed and immediately donned. Neither of the suits must show damage such as shrinking, cracking, swelling, dissolution or change of mechanical qualities.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Measured buoyancy.</E> The buoyancy of a suit must be measured under the following conditions and procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Test equipment.</E> The following equipment is required for this test:</P>
              <P>(i) A mesh basket that is large enough to hold a folded suit, and that is weighted sufficiently to overcome the buoyancy of the suit when placed in the basket.</P>
              <P>(ii) A tank of water that is large enough to contain the basket submerged with its top edge 50 mm (2 in.) below the surface of the water.</P>
              <P>(iii) A scale or load cell that has an accuracy of 0.15 Newtons (1/2 oz.) and that is arranged to support and weigh the basket in the tank.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> The basket is submerged so that its top edge is 50 mm (2 in.) below the surface of the water. The basket is then weighed. Thereafter, a suit is submerged in water and then filled with water, folded, and placed in the submerged basket. The basket is titled 45° from the vertical for five minutes in each of four different directions to allow all entrapped air to escape. The basket is then suspended with its top edge 50 mm (2 in.) below the surface of the water for 24 hours. At the beginning and end of this period, the basket and suit are weighed underwater. The <PRTPAGE P="280"/>measured buoyancy of the suit is the difference between this weight and the weight of the basket as determined at the beginning of the test. The measured buoyancy after 24 hours must not be more than 5% lower than the initial measured buoyancy. The measured buoyancy after 24 hours is used to determine adjusted buoyancy as described in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Adjusted buoyancy.</E> The adjusted buoyancy of a suit is its measured buoyancy reduced by the percentage buoyancy loss factor of the buoyant suit material. The percentage buoyancy loss factor is part of the buoyancy rating code determined in accordance with UL 1191, except that the minimum number of samples required to determine each property is 10 instead of 75.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Suit flame exposure.</E> The suit's resistance to flame must be tested under the following conditions and procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Test equipment.</E> The following equipment is required for this test:</P>
              <P>(i) A metal pan that is at least 300 mm (12 in.) wide, 450 mm (18 in.) long, and 60 mm (2<FR>1/2</FR> in.) deep. The pan must have at least 12 mm (<FR>1/2</FR> in.) of water on the bottom with approximately 40 mm (1<FR>1/2</FR> in.) of gasoline floating on top of the water.</P>
              <P>(ii) An arrangement to hold the suit over the gasoline.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> A suit is held from its top by the holding arrangement. The gasoline is ignited and allowed to burn for approximately 30 seconds in a draft-free location. The suit is then held with the lowest part of each foot 240 mm (9.5 in.) above the surface of the burning gasoline. After two seconds, measured from the moment the flame first contacts the suit, the suit is removed from the fire. The suit must not sustain burning or continue melting after removal from the flames. If the suit sustains any visible damage other than scorching, it must then be subjected to the stability test described in paragraph (c)(8) of this section, except that only one subject need be used; the impact test described in paragraph (c)(11) of this section, except that only one subject need be used; the thermal protection test described in paragraph (d) of this section, except that only one subject need be used; and the buoyancy test described in paragraph (g) of this section, except that the buoyancy test need be conducted for only 2 hours.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Storage case flame exposure.</E> The storage case must be tested using the same equipment required for the suit flame exposure test. The immersion suit must be inside the storage case for this test. The storage case is held from its top by the holding arrangement. The gasoline is ignited and allowed to burn for approximately 30 seconds in a draft-free location. The storage case is then held with its lowest part 240 mm (9.5 in.) above the surface of the burning gasoline. After two seconds, measured from the moment the flames first contact the case, the case is removed from the fire. If the case is burning, it is allowed to continue to burn for six seconds before the flames are extinguished. The storage case material must not burn through at any point in this test and the immersion suit must not sustain any visible damage.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Corrosion resistance.</E> Each metal part of a suit that is not 410 stainless steel, or for which published evidence of salt-spray corrosion resistance equal to or greater than 410 stainless steel is not available, must be tested as described in ASTM B 117 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.171-3). A sample of each metal under test and a sample of 410 stainless steel must be tested for 720 hours. At the conclusion of the test, each sample of test metal must show corrosion resistance equal to or better than the sample of 410 stainless steel.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Body strength.</E> The body strength of a suit must be tested under the following conditions and procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Test equipment.</E> The test apparatus shown in figure 160.171-17(1)(1) must be used for this test. This apparatus consists of—</P>
              <P>(i) Two rigid cylinders each 125 mm (5 in.) in diameter, with an eye or ring at each end;</P>
              <P>(ii) A weight of 135 kg (300 lb.); and</P>
              <P>(iii) Ropes or cables of sufficient length to allow the suit to be suspended as shown in Figure 160.171-17(1)(1).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> The suit is cut at the waist and wrists, or holes are cut into it as necessary to accommodate <PRTPAGE P="281"/>the test apparatus. The suit is immersed in water for at least two minutes. The suit is then removed from the water and immediately arranged on the test apparatus, using each closure as it would be used by a person wearing the suit. The 135 kg (300 lb.) load is applied for 5 minutes. No part of the suit may tear or break during this test. The suit must not be damaged in any way that would allow water to enter or that would affect the performance of the suit.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Seam strength.</E> The strength of each different type of seam used in a suit must be tested under the following conditions and procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Test equipment.</E> The following equipment must be used for this test.</P>
              <P>(i) A chamber in which air temperature can be kept at 23 °C (73.4 °F) ±2 °C (1.8 °F) and in which relative humidity can be kept at 50% ±5%.</P>
              <P>(ii) A device to apply tension to the seam by the means of a pair of top jaws and a pair of bottom jaws. Each set of jaws must grip the material on both sides so that it does not slip when the load is applied.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test samples.</E> Each test sample must consist of two pieces of suit material, each of which is a 100 mm (4 in.) square. The two pieces are joined by a seam as shown in figure 160.171-17(m)(3). For each type of seam, 5 samples are required. Each sample may be cut from the suit or may be prepared specifically for this test. One type of seam is distinguished from another by the type and size of stitch or other joining method used and by the type and thickness of the materials joined at the seam.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> Each sample is conditioned for at least 40 hours at 23 °C (73.4 °F) ±2°(1.8 °F) C and 50% ±5% relative humidity. Immediately after conditioning, each sample is mounted individually in the tension device as shown in figure 160.171-17(m)(3). The jaws are separated at a rate of 5 mm/second (12 in./minute). The force at rupture is recorded. The average force at rupture must be at least 225 Newtons (50 lb.).</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Tear resistance.</E> The tear resistance of suit material must be determined by the method described in ASTM D 1004. If more than one material is used, each material must be tested. If varying thickness of a material are used in the suit, samples representing the thinnest portion of the material must be tested. If multiple layers of a material are used in the suit, samples representing the layer on the exterior of the suit must be tested. Any material which is a composite formed of two or more materials bonded together is considered to be a single material. The average tearing strength of each material must be at least 45 Newtons (10 lb.).</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Abrasion resistance.</E> The abrasion resistance of each type of suit material on the exterior of the suit must be determined by the method described in Federal Test Method Standard 191, Method 5304.1. If varying thicknesses of exterior suit material are used, samples representing the thinnest portion of the material must be tested. If exterior material has multiple layers, samples of the layer on the outside surface of the suit must be tested. Any exterior material which is a composite formed of two or more layers bonded together is considered to be a single material and the abradant must be applied to the surface that is on the exterior of the suit. The residual breaking strength of each material must be at least 225 Newtons (50 lb.).</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Test for oil resistance.</E> After all its apertures have been sealed, an immersion suit is immersed under a 100 mm head of diesel oil, grade No. 2-D as defined in ASTM D 975 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.171-3) for 24 hours. The surface oil is then wiped off and the immersion suit subjected to the leak test prescribed in § 160.171-17(c)(10). The ingress of water must not be greater than 200 grams.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A thermal protective aid must be tested as prescribed in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Mobility and swimming tests.</E> The mobility and swimming capabilities of each thermal protective aid must be tested under the following conditions and procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Test subjects.</E> Seven males and three females must be used in the tests described in this paragraph. The subjects must represent each of the three physical types (ectomorphic, endomorphic, and mesomorphic). Each subject must be in good health. The heaviest male subject must weigh at least 25 kg (55 lb) more than the lightest male subject. The heaviest female subject must weigh at least 25 kg (55 lb) more than the lightest female subject. The heaviest subject must weigh 150±5 Kg (330±11 lbs.) and the lightest subject must weigh 50±5 Kg (110±11 lbs.). Each subject must be unfamiliar with the <PRTPAGE P="288"/>specific thermal protective aid under test. Each subject must wear a standard range of clothing consisting of:</P>
              <P>(i) Underwear (short sleeved, short legged);</P>
              <P>(ii) Shirt (long sleeved);</P>
              <P>(iii) Trousers (not woolen);</P>
              <P>(iv) Woolen socks;</P>
              <P>(v) Rubber soled shoes; and</P>
              <P>(vi) A life preserver.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Donning test.</E> Each subject is removed from the view of the other subjects and allowed one minute to examine the thermal protective aid and the manufacturer's instructions for donning and use of the aid in an emergency. At the end of this period, the subject attempts to don the thermal protective aid as rapidly as possible. If the subject does not don the thermal protective aid completely, including gloves and any other accessories, within 60 seconds, the subject removes the aid and is given a demonstration of correct donning, and again attempts to don the aid. At least nine out of ten subjects must be able to don the thermal protective aid completely in 60 seconds on at least one of the two attempts.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Discarding test.</E> If the thermal protective aid impairs the ability of the wearer to swim, it must be demonstrated that it can be discarded by the test subjects, when immersed in water, in not more than two minutes. Caution: During each of the in water tests prescribed in this section, a person ready to render assistance when needed should be near each subject in the water.</P>
              <P>(i) Unless the manufacturer specifies in the instructions that the thermal protective aid does impair ability to swim and should always be discarded in the water, each subject, wearing a life preserver, enters the water and swims 25 meters. The subject, after sufficient rest to avoid fatigue, repeats this test wearing a thermal protective aid in addition to the life preserver. At least nine out of ten subjects must be able to swim this distance wearing the thermal protective aid in not more than 125% of the time taken to swim the distance wearing only a life preserver, or the aid will be determined to impair the ability to swim.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the thermal protective aid is determined by the above test or specified by the manufacturer to impair the ability to swim, each subject, after entering the water from a height of one meter (three feet), attempts to remove the aid and discard it. At least nine out of ten subjects must be able to discard the device within two minutes.</P>
              <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Storage temperature.</E> Two samples of the thermal protective aids, in their storage cases, are alternately subjected to surrounding temperatures of −30 °C to + 65 °C. These alternating cycles need not follow immediately after each other and the following procedure, repeated for a total of ten cycles, is acceptable:</P>
              <P>(1) 8 hours conditioning at 65 °C to be completed in one day;</P>
              <P>(2) The specimens removed from the warm chamber that same day and left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day;</P>
              <P>(3) 8 hours conditioning at −30 °C to be completed the next day; and</P>
              <P>(4) The specimens removed from the cold chamber that same day and left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day. At the conclusion of step (3) of the final cycle of cold storage, two test subjects who successfully completed the donning test previously enter the cold chamber, unpack and don the thermal protective aids. The aids must not show any damage, such as shrinking, cracking, swelling, dissolution or change of mechanical qualities.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Water penetration.</E> A sample of the fabric from which the thermal protective aid is constructed is installed as a membrane at one end of a tube of at least 2.5 cm (one inch) diameter and 2 meters long. The tube is fixed in a vertical position with the membrane at the bottom, and filled with water. After one hour the membrane must continue to support the column of water with no leakage.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Insulation.</E> The material from which the thermal protective aid is constructed is tested in accordance with the procedures in ASTM C 177, ASTM C 518, or ASTM D 1518. The material must have a thermal conductivity of not more than 0.25 W/(m−°K) <PRTPAGE P="289"/>(incorporated by reference, see § 160.174-3).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Test for oil resistance.</E> After all its apertures have been sealed, a thermal protective aid is immersed under a 100 mm head of diesel oil, grade no. 2-D as defined in ASTM D 975 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.174-3), for 24 hours. The surface oil is then wiped off and a sample of the material from the aid is again tested in accordance with the procedures in ASTM C 177 or ASTM C 518 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.174-3). The material must still have a thermal conductivity of not more than 0.25 W/(m−° K).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Seam strength.</E> The strength of each different type of seam used in a thermal protective aid must be tested under the following conditions and procedures.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Test equipment.</E> The following equipment must be used in this test:</P>
              <P>(i) A chamber in which air temperature can be kept at 25 °C (73.4 °F) ±2 °C (1.8 °F) and in which relative humidity can be kept at 50% ±5%.</P>
              <P>(ii) A device to apply tension to the seam by means of a pair of top jaws and a pair of bottom jaws. Each set of jaws must grip the material on both sides so that it does not slip when the load is applied. Each front jaw must be 25 mm (1 inch) wide by 25 mm (1 inch) long. The distance between the jaws before the load is applied must be 75mm (3 inches).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test samples.</E> Each test sample consists of two pieces of the material from which the thermal protective aid is constructed, each of which is 100 mm (4 inches) square. The two pieces are joined by a seam as shown in figure 160.171-17(m)(3). For each type of seam, 5 samples are required. Each sample may be cut from a thermal protective aid or may be prepared specifically for this test. One type of seam is distinguished from another by the type and size of stitch or other joining method used (including orientation of warp and fill, if any) and by the type and thickness of the materials joined at the seam.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> Each sample is conditioned for at least 40 hours at 23 °C±2 °C and 50% ±5% relative humidity. Immediately after conditioning, each sample is mounted individually in the tension device as shown in figure 160.171-17(m)(3). The jaws are separated at a rate of 5 mm/second (12 in/minute). The maximum force to achieve rupture is recorded. The average force at rupture must be at least 225 Newtons (50 lb).</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Tear resistance.</E> The tear resistance of the material from which a thermal protective aid is constructed must be determined by the method described in ASTM D 1004 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.174-3). If more than one material is used, each material must be tested. If varying thicknesses of a material are used in the aid, samples representing the thinnest portion of the material must be tested. If multiple layers of a material are used in the aid, samples representing the layer on the exterior of the aid must be tested. Any material that is a composite formed of two or more materials bonded together is considered to be a single material. The average tearing strength of each material must be at least 45 Newtons (10 lb).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) This section contains requirements for approval tests and examinations of inflatable lifejackets. Each test or examination must be conducted or supervised by an independent laboratory. The tests must be done using lifejackets that have been constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications in the application for approval. Unless otherwise specified, only one lifejacket, which may or may not have been subjected to other tests, is required to be tested in each test. One or more lifejackets that have been tested as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section must be used for the tests prescribed in paragraphs (j), (n), (q), and (r) of this section. The tests prescribed in paragraph (y) of this section require one or more lifejackets as specified in that paragraph.</P>
              <P>(2) All data relating to buoyancy and pressure must be taken at, or corrected to, an atmospheric pressure of 760 mm (29.92 inches) of mercury and a temperature of 20 °C (68 °F).</P>
              <P>(3) The tests in this section are not required to be run in the order listed, except where a particular order is specified.</P>

              <P>(4) Some tests in this section require a lifejacket to be tested while being worn. In each of these tests the test subjects must represent a range of small, medium, and large heights and weights. Unless otherwise specified, a <PRTPAGE P="297"/>minimum of 18 test subjects, including both males and females, must be used. The test subjects must not be practiced in the use of the lifejacket being tested. However, they must be familiar with the use of other Coast Guard approved lifejackets. Unless specified otherwise, test subjects must wear only swim suits. Each test subject must be able to swim and relax in the water.

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Donning.</E> (1) No second stage donning is allowed in the tests in this paragraph. Test subjects may read the donning instructions to be provided with the device, if any. An uninflated lifejacket with size adjustment at its mid-range is given to each test subject with the instruction: “Please don as quickly as possible, adjust to fit snugly, and inflate.” Each subject must, within one minute, don the uninflated lifejacket, adjust it to fit snugly, and then activate the manual inflation mechanism.

              <P>(2) The average time of all subjects to complete the test in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must not exceed 30 seconds. The criteria in this paragraph do not apply to the tests in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The test in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is repeated with each subject wearing an insulated, hooded parka and gloves made from heavy, cotton-jersey (knit) fabric.</P>
              <P>(4) The test in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is then repeated twice more with a fully inflated lifejacket. In the first test the subjects must wear swim suits and in the second test, parka and gloves.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Inflation Testing.</E> No second stage donning is allowed in the tests in this paragraph. A lifejacket with each automatic inflation mechanism disabled must be used for the tests prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. For the tests prescribed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, remove any non-reusable cover or packaging from the lifejacket, but do not open any cover or closure which is intended to be closed when the lifejacket is worn in the uninflated condition.</P>
              <P>(1) Each test subject dons an uninflated lifejacket and is instructed to enter the water and swim for approximately 30 seconds and then, on command, inflate the lifejacket using only oral inflation mechanisms. Within 30 seconds after the command is given, the lifejacket must be sufficiently inflated to float each subject with respiration unimpeded.</P>
              <P>(2) Each test subject dons an uninflated lifejacket and is instructed to enter the water and swim for approximately 30 seconds, bring both hands to the surface, and then, on command, inflate the lifejacket using each manual inflation mechanism. Each test subject must find and operate all the manual inflation mechanisms within 5 seconds after the command is given. The manual inflation mechanisms must inflate the lifejacket sufficiently to float the wearers within 5 seconds after the mechanisms are operated. Within 20 seconds after activation each subject must be floating in the position described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) One small and one large test subject don uninflated lifejackets and jump feet first from a height of 1 meter into the water. The automatic inflation mechanisms must inflate the lifejackets sufficiently to float the wearers within 10 seconds after the subjects enter the water. Within 20 seconds after entering the water each subject must be floating in the position described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Air at a pressure of 4.2 kPa (0.6 psig) is applied separately to each oral inflation mechanism of the lifejacket. In each application the chamber must fully inflate within 1 minute.</P>
              <P>(5) Each oral inflation mechanism of an unpacked lifejacket is connected to a regulated air source constantly supplying air at a pressure of 7 kPa (1 psig). Each mechanism must pass at least 100,000 cc of air per minute.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Flotation stability</E>—(1) <E T="03">Uninflated flotation stability.</E> Lifejackets with their automatic inflation mechanisms disabled must be used for this test. Each subject dons an uninflated lifejacket, <PRTPAGE P="298"/>enters the water, and assumes an upright, slightly back of vertical, position. Each subject then relaxes. For each subject that floats, the uninflated lifejacket must not tend to turn the wearer face-down when the head is allowed to fall back.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Righting action.</E> (i) Each test subject dons an uninflated lifejacket, enters the water, allows the automatic inflation mechanism to inflate the lifejacket, and swims for 30 seconds. While swimming, freedom of movement and comfort are observed and noted by the person conducting the test. Freedom of movement and comfort must comply with § 160.176-11(d). Also, each subject must demonstrate that the lifejacket can be adjusted while the subject is in the water.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each subject then takes three gentle breast strokes and while still face-down in the water, relaxes completely while slowly exhaling to FRC. Each subject remains in this limp position long enough to determine if the lifejacket will turn the subject from the face-down position to a position in which the subject's breathing is not impaired. The time from the last breast stroke until breathing is not impaired is recorded. Each subject repeats these steps two additional times, and the average time for the three righting actions is calculated. This average time must not exceed 5 seconds.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the lifejacket does not have automatic inflation mechanisms for all chambers, the tests in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(ii) of this section are repeated with each lifejacket fully inflated.</P>
              <P>(iv) Each subject then performs the test in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section with one chamber of the lifejacket deflated. This test is then repeated as many times as necessary to test the lifejacket with a different chamber deflated until each chamber has been tested in this manner.</P>
              <P>(v) Each subject then performs the test in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section but exhales to FRC at the end of the third breast stroke and holds the breath prior to relaxing.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Static measurements.</E> At the end of each test with each subject in § 160.176-13(d)(2)(ii), through § 160.176-13(d)(2)(v)—</P>

              <P>(i) Face down, shoulder forward.</P>
              <P>(ii) Face down, shoulder back.</P>
              <P>(iii) Back down, shoulder forward.</P>
              <P>(iv) Back down, shoulder back.</P>
              <P>(v) Left side down, shoulder forward.</P>
              <P>(vi) Right side down, shoulder back.</P>

              <P>(2) Following each impact, there must be no sign of functional deterioration, and the lifejacket must not come off of the test form. After each <PRTPAGE P="304"/>impact the closures may be readjusted as necessary.</P>
              <P>(3) Following the six impacts, the lifejacket must fully inflate using only its oral inflation mechanisms.</P>
              <P>(4) The test in this paragraph is repeated on the same lifejacket after inflating, with manual inflation mechanisms, all chambers that have those mechanism.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Flame exposure test.</E> A lifejacket that has been subjected to the tests in paragraph (h) of this section must be used for this test.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Equipment.</E> The following equipment is required for this test:</P>
              <P>(i) A test pan 300 mm by 450 mm by 60 mm (12 in. by 18 in. by 2<FR>1/2</FR> in.) containing 12 mm (<FR>1/2</FR> in.) of water under 25 mm (1 in.) of N-heptane.</P>
              <P>(ii) an arrangement to hold the lifejacket over the N-heptane.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Method.</E> The test is only conducted when there is no significant air movement other than that caused by the fire. The N-heptane is ignited and allowed to burn for 30 seconds. A lifejacket which has been fully inflated with air is then passed through the flames in an upright, forward, vertical, free-hanging position with the bottom of the lifejacket 240 mm C 9<FR>1/2</FR> in.) above the top edge of the test pan. The lifejacket is exposed to the flames for 2 seconds.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Requirement.</E> The lifejacket must not burn or melt for more than 6 seconds after being removed from the flames. The lifejacket must remain inflated throughout the test. If the lifejacket sustains any visible damage other than discoloration after being exposed to the flames, the lifejacket must—</P>
              <P>(i) pass the test in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, except that only one subject is used and the test is done six times; and</P>
              <P>(ii) pass the tensile test in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, except that a weight of 245 kg (540 lb.) is used in lieu of the 325 kg (720 lb.) weight.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">Solvent exposure test.</E> Lifejackets with their automatic inflation mechanisms disabled must be used for this test. Two uninflated lifejackets that have been subjected to the tests in paragraph (h) of this section are totally submerged in diesel fuel, grade No. 2-D as defined in ASTM D 975 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.176-4), for 24 hours. The lifejackets are then removed and the excess fuel removed. One lifejacket must fully inflate using only its manual inflation mechanisms and the other using only its oral inflation mechanisms. The lifejackets must show no functional deterioration as a result of the test.</P>
              <P>(s) <E T="03">Puncture test.</E> A fully inflated lifejacket is placed on a flat, level surface. A test point 4 mm (<FR>5/32</FR> in.) in diameter tapering to a rounded point, 1 mm (<FR>3/64</FR> in.) in diameter, is pressed against an inflation chamber of the lifejacket perpendicular to the surface of the chamber at a rate of 300 mm/minute (12 in./minute). The test point is applied until the inflation chamber is punctured or the chamber walls are touching each other. The force required to puncture the inflation chamber or make the chamber walls touch each other is recorded. The force required must exceed 30 N (7 lb.).</P>
              <P>(t) <E T="03">Inflation chamber tests</E>—(1) <E T="03">Over-pressure test.</E> One lifejacket is used in this test. Before pressurizing the lifejacket, each over-pressure valve, if any, must be blocked. One inflation chamber is then pressurized with air to 70 kPa (10 psig) and held for 5 minutes. After the 5 minute period, there must be no sign of permanent deformation, damage, or pressure loss of more than 3.5 kPa (0.5 psig). This test is then repeated as many times as necessary to test a different chamber until each chamber has been tested in this manner.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Air retention test.</E> One inflation chamber of a lifejacket is filled with air until air escapes from the over-pressure valve or, if the lifejacket does not have an over-pressure valve, until its design pressure, as stated in the plans and specifications, is reached. After 12 hours the lifejacket must still be firm with an internal pressure of at least 14 kPa (2.0 psig). This test is then repeated as many times as necessary to test a different chamber until each chamber has been tested in this manner.</P>
              <P>(u) <E T="03">Seam strength test.</E> Samples of each type of structural sewn seam must be subjected to and pass the “Seam Strength (Sewability) Test” <PRTPAGE P="305"/>specified in Underwriters Laboratories Standard UL 1191 except that the breaking strength of each seam in the directions of both greater and lesser thread count must be at least 400 N (90 lb.).</P>
              <P>(v) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(w) <E T="03">Visual examination.</E> One complete lifejacket must be visually examined for compliance with the requirements of §§ 160.176-9 and 160.176-11 of this part</P>
              <P>(x) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(y) <E T="03">Inflation chamber properties.</E> The tests in this paragraph must be run after successful completion of all other approval tests. The results of these tests will be used to check the quality of incoming lifejacket components and the production process. Test samples must come from one or more lifejackets that were each used in all of the tests in paragraphs (e), (j), (p), (s), and (t) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Grab breaking strength.</E> The grab breaking strength of chamber materials must be determined according to Method No. 5100 of Federal Test Method Standard 191A or ASTM D 751 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.176-4).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Tear strength.</E> The tear strength of chamber materials must be determined according to Method No. 5132 or 5134 of Federal Test Method Standard 191A or ASTM D 751 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.176-4).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Permeability.</E> The permeability of chamber materials must be determined according to ASTM D 1434 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.176-4) using CO<E T="52">2</E> as the test gas.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Seam strength.</E> The seam strength of the seams in each inflation chamber of at least one lifejacket must be determined according to ASTM D 751 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.176-4) except that 25 by 200 mm (1 by 8 in.) samples may be used where insufficient length of straight seam is available.</P>
              <P>(z) <E T="03">Additional tests.</E> The Commandant may prescribe additional tests, if necessary, to approve novel or unique designs.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Lifejacket lots.</E> A lot number must be assigned to each group of lifejackets produced. No lot may exceed 1000 lifejackets. A new lot must be started whenever any change in materials or a revision to a production method is made, and whenever any substantial discontinuity in the production process occurs. Changes in lots of component materials must be treated as changes in materials. Lots must be numbered serially. The lot number assigned, along with the approval number, must enable the lifejacket manufacturer, by referring to the records required by this subpart, to determine who produced the components used in the lifejacket.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Samples.</E> (1) Samples used in testing and inspections must be selected at random. Sampling must be done only when all lifejackets or materials in the lot are available for selection.</P>
              <P>(2) Each sample lifejacket selected must be complete, unless otherwise specified in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The inspector may not select the same samples tested by the manufacturer.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Test Conditions.</E> (1) Each test described in this section must be performed at a throughput and influent pressure equal to the maximum throughput and pressure at which the separator being tested is designed to operate. The tests and each of the steps in the tests must be carried out in the order described in this section. Each test must be performed without time delay between steps in the test.</P>
              <P>(2) A test rig of the type described in § 162.050-17 must be used in performing each test.</P>
              <P>(3) If a separator has a supply pump, it must be tested using that pump. If a separator does not have a supply pump, it must be tested using the mixture pump on the test rig.</P>
              <P>(4) The influent water used in each test must be clean fresh water or clean fresh water in solution with sodium chloride. In either case, the relative density of the water must be no greater than 1.015 at 20 °C.</P>
              <P>(5) Each test must be conducted at an ambient temperature of between 10 °C and 30 °C.</P>
              <P>(6) The oil content of each sample must be measured using the method described in § 162.050-39.</P>
              <P>(7) Influent oil content must be determined during testing by measuring the flow rates of the oil and water that are mixed to form the influent or by use of an oil content meter on the inlet piping of the test rig. If an oil content meter is used, a sample of influent and a meter reading must be taken at the beginning of each test. If the meter reading is not within ±10 percent of the oil content of the sample, the meter readings subsequently taken during the test are unacceptable test results.</P>
              <P>(8) When collecting a sample at a sample point that has a stop cock, the first minute of fluid flow through the stop cock must not be included in the sample collected.</P>
              <P>(9) In each test, the separator must be operated in accordance with the procedures described in its instruction manual.</P>
              <P>(10) No maintenance, including replacement of parts, may be performed on a separator during or between the tests described in this section.</P>
              <P>(11) A 1 liter sample of each oil to be used in testing must be taken and provided for use in the sample analysis required by § 162.050-39 .</P>
              <P>(12) The separator may not be operated manually in Test No. 5A.</P>
              <P>(13) If a separator has an integral bilge alarm, the separator must be tested with the bilge alarm installed.</P>
              <P>(b) The following tests must be conducted using Test Fluid A:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Test No. 1A.</E> The separator is filled with water and started. Next, the separator is fed with pure Test Fluid A for at least 5 minutes and then with a mixture of Test Fluid A and water influent containing Test Fluid A content of between 5,000 and 10,000 ppm until a steady flow rate at a steady, constant ppm occurs. After the flow rate is steady, the influent is fed to the separator for 30 minutes. Samples of separated water effluent are taken after the first 10 and 20 minutes. At the end of the 30-minute period, the air cock on the test rig is opened and, if necessary, the oil and water supply valves are closed to stop the flow of influent. A sample is then taken of the separated water effluent as the effluent flow ceases.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test No. 2A.</E> Repeat Test No. 1A in paragraph (b)(1) of this section using an influent containing approximately 25 percent oil and 75 percent water. Percentage is on a by volume basis.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Test No. 3A.</E> The separator is fed with 100 percent Test Fluid A until Fluid A is discharged at the oil discharge outlet of the separator at essentially the same rate that oil is being fed to the separator. The separator is then fed with 100 percent Test Fluid A for 5 additional minutes. If any oily <PRTPAGE P="350"/>mixture is discharged from the separated water outlet on the separator during the test, that observation is recorded.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Test No. 4A.</E> The separator is fed with water for 15 minutes. Samples of the separated water effluent are taken at the beginning of the test and after the first 10 minutes.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Test No. 5A.</E> The separator is operated automatically for 3 hours. During the test, the separator is continuously fed with an influent varying from water to a mixture of 25 percent Test Fluid A in water and back to water every 15 minutes. The Test Fluid A concentration in the influent is varied in at least five equal increments during each 15-minute period and the time intervals between the incremental changes are equal. During the last hour, the separator must be inclined at an angle of 22.5° with the plane of its normal operating position. During the last time increment in which the unit is fed a 25 percent Fluid A mixture, a sample of the separated water effluent is taken. If the separator stops at any time during this test, that observation is recorded.</P>
              <P>(c) The following tests must be conducted using Test Fluid B:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Test No. 1B.</E> Repeat Test No. 1A in paragraph (b)(1) of this section using Test Fluid B; and</P>

              <P>(d) The following tests must be conducted using Test Fluid C: <E T="03">Test No. 1C.</E> The separator is fed with a mixture composed of 6 percent Test Fluid C and 94 percent water by volume such that the emulsified Test Fluid C content is approximately 3,000 ppm in the test water until a steady flow rate occurs. After the flow rate is steady, the influent containing the 6 percent Test Fluid C solution is fed to the separator operating automatically for 3 hours. Samples of separated water effluent are taken at 50 minutes and 100 minutes. At the end of the 3-hour period, the air cock on the test rig is opened and, if necessary, the oil and water supply valves are closed to stop the flow of influent. A sample is then taken of the separated water effluent as the effluent flow ceases.</P>

The land-based testing will determine if the biological efficacy of the BWMS under consideration for approval is sufficient to meet the applicable ballast water discharge standard (BWDS) and validate those aspects of the operating and maintenance parameters presented by the manufacturer that are appropriate for assessment under the relatively short-term, but well-controlled, circumstances of a land-based test.</P>
              <P>(b) The test set up must operate as described in the ETV Protocol Test Plan requirements during at least five consecutive, valid, and successful replicate test cycles. No adjustments to the BWMS are permitted unless specifically detailed in the Operation, Maintenance and Safety Manual. The BWMS must be operated by independent laboratory or independent laboratory subcontractor personnel.</P>
              <P>(c) Each valid test cycle must include—</P>
              <P>(1) Uptake of source water by pumping at a minimum of 200 m<SU>3</SU>/hr;</P>
              <P>(2) Treatment of a minimum of 200 m<SU>3</SU> of challenge water with the BWMS;</P>
              <P>(3) Pumping of a minimum of 200 m<SU>3</SU> of control water through the test facility in a manner that is in all ways identical to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, except that the BWMS is not used to treat the water;</P>

              <P>(iii) Treatment equipment with a TRC equal to or greater than 1,000 m<SU>3</SU>/h may be downscaled to a maximum of 1:100 scale, but must not be less than 200 m<SU>3</SU>/h.</P>
              <P>(iv) The manufacturer of the BWMS must demonstrate by using mathematical modeling, computational fluid dynamics modeling, and/or by calculations, that any downscaling will not affect the ultimate functioning and effectiveness onboard a vessel of the type and size for which the BWMS will be approved.</P>
              <P>(2) Greater scaling may be applied and lower flow rates used other than those described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section if the manufacturer can provide evidence from full-scale shipboard testing, in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, that greater scaling and lower flow rates will not adversely affect the testing's ability to predict full-scale compliance with the BWDS. The procedures of § 162.060-10(b)(1) of this subpart must be followed before scaling of flow rates other than those provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section may be used.</P>
              <P>(g) The test set-up, TRC, and scaling of all tests (including mathematical and computational fluid dynamics modeling) must be clearly identified in the Experimental Design section of the Test Plan.</P>

              <P>(i) The top end of one suspension member on each side of the ladder must extend at least 3 m (10 ft.) beyond the top ladder step; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The top ends of the other suspension members must be just above the top step and must have an eye splice or thimble large enough to fit two passes of a suspension member.</P>
              <P>(3) The top end of each suspension member that does not have an eye splice or thimble must be served or treated to prevent fraying.</P>

              <P>(4) Each pair of suspension members must be clamped together both above <PRTPAGE P="385"/>and below each step. Marline seizing may not be used.</P>
              <P>(5) The clear space between the suspension members on one side of a ladder and those on the other side must be at least 400 mm (16 in.), but not more than 480 mm (19 in.).</P>
              <P>(6) The suspension members must not have fittings at the bottom of the ladder that can be used for attaching additional ladder sections.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Steps.</E> Pilot ladder steps must meet the following requirements:</P>

Non-skid grit is applied directly to the step surface extending to almost the full width of the step.)</P>
              <P>(3) Each step at its thinnest point must be at least 25 mm (1 in.) thick and in determining this thickness, the depth of the grooves in the non-skid surface and the diameter of any hole extending from one side of the step to the other must not be counted.</P>
              <P>(4) Each step must be at least 480 mm (19 in.) long.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Approval tests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Each approval test must be conducted on a ladder of the longest length for which approval has been requested. If the ladder fails one of the tests, the cause of the failure must be identified and any needed design changes made. After a test failure and any design change, the failed test, and any other previously completed tests affected by the change, must be rerun. Any ladder step that has a residual deflection after testing under this section may not be used thereafter in any ladder represented as Coast Guard approved.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Visual examination.</E> Before starting the approval tests, an assembled pilot ladder is examined for evidence of noncompliance with the requirements in §§ 163.003-11, 163.003-13, and 163.003-15.</P>
              <P>(c) The following approval tests must be conducted:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Step flexibility test.</E> This test is performed on six different steps, one of which must be a molded step and one of which must be a replacement step if special replacement steps are made by the manufacturer. Each step is placed on a pair of supports located at the points where the step would ordinarily be attached to the suspension members. A static load must be applied uniformly for a period of at least one minute over a contact surface that is at the center of the step and is approximately 100 mm (4 in.) wide. The load must be 150 kg (330 lb.) for each molded step that is used only as one of the four bottom steps in the ladder. The load must be 320 kg (700 lb.) for each other step. The deflection of the step is measured while the step is under load and after the load is removed. The step must not deflect more than 20 mm (<FR>3/4</FR> in.) under the load, and there must be no residual deflection after the load is removed.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Strength test #1.</E> An assembled ladder is supported so that a static load, if placed on any of its steps, would exert a force on both the step and each suspension member. A static load of 900 kg (2,000 lb.) is then placed on one step for at least one minute. The load must be uniformly distributed over a contact surface that is approximately 100 mm (4 in.) wide. The center of the contact surface must be at the center of the step. This test is performed on six different steps, one of which must be a molded step. None of the steps may break or crack. No attachment between any step and a suspension member may loosen or break during this test.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Strength test #2.</E> An assembled ladder is suspended vertically to its full length. A static load of 900 kg (2,000 lb.) is then applied to the bottom step of the ladder so that it is distributed equally between the suspension members. The suspension members, and inserts must not break, incur any elongation or deformation that remains after the test load is removed, or be damaged in any other way during this test.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Strength test #3.</E> A rolled up ladder is attached to anchoring fixtures in a location away from any wall or structure that would prevent it from falling freely, and where it can hang to its full length vertically. The ladder when dropped must unroll freely. When unrolling the ladder, its steps and attachments must not become cracked, broken, or loosened. Other similar damage making the ladder unsafe to use must likewise not occur.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Step friction test.</E> One step of each type used on a pilot ladder must be subjected to this test. This test compares the dry and wet surface friction characteristics of ladder steps with those of a standard oak step.</P>

              <P>(i) The standard step must have a surface of clean oak that meets S/163.003-11(b) and that is 115 mm (4<FR>1/2</FR> in.) wide by 400 mm (16 in.) long. The stepping surface must have grooves that are 3 mm (<FR>1/8</FR> in.) deep and 3 mm wide. The grooves must run in two different <PRTPAGE P="387"/>directions at right angles to each other, and at 45 degree angles with each edge of the stepping surface, so that the grooves form a diamond pattern covering the stepping surface. The centers of all parallel grooves must be 13 mm (<FR>1/2</FR> in.) apart.</P>
              <P>(ii) The standard step must be set in a level position. A metal block must be placed on one end of the step so that the block is in contact with the stepping surface. The metal block must weigh between 1.5 kg (3.3 lb.) and 3.0 kg (6.6 lb.) and must not be more than 100 mm (4 in.) wide by 135 mm (5<FR>3/8</FR> in.) long. The surface of the block in contact with the step must have leather or composition shoe sole material attached to it.</P>
              <P>(iii) The end of the step that has the metal block on it must be slowly raised until the block starts to slide. The angle of the step in this position must be measured and recorded. The step and block must then be placed under water and the procedure repeated.</P>
              <P>(iv) The procedure in paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section must be repeated using a pilot ladder step in place of the standard step.</P>
              <P>(v) The ladder step must then be secured in a horizontal position with a block resting on its stepping surface. The block must be of a size similar to the one used in the previous tests and have the same shoe sole surface used in the previous tests. The block must be arranged to apply a vertical load of 40 kg (88 lb.) to the step. The block must be then moved back and forth in the same line from one end of the stepping surface to the other. This must be done for a total of 1,500 cycles.</P>
              <P>(vi) The step must again be tested as described in paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section, except that the initial position of the block must be on a part of the stepping surface that was subjected to the 1,500 cycles of rubbing.</P>
              <P>(vii) The angles at which the block starts to slide on a wet and dry ladder step when tested under paragraphs (c)(6)(iv) and (c)(6)(vi) of this section must be equal to or greater than the corresponding angles measured for the standard step when tested under paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Test No. 2: Ladders.</E> Assembled ladders must be separated into lots of 20 ladders or less. One ladder must be selected at random from the ladders in each lot. The ladder selected must be at least 3 m (10 ft.) long or, if each ladder in the lot is less than 3 m long, a <PRTPAGE P="388"/>ladder of the longest length in the lot must be selected. The ladder must be tested as prescribed in § 163.003-21(c)(3) except that only a 3 m section of the ladder need be subjected to the static load. If the ladder fails the test, each other ladder in the lot must be tested.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Independent laboratory.</E> Each production test must be conducted or supervised by an independent laboratory. However, if a test is performed more than 4 different times per year, laboratory participation is required only 4 times per year. If the laboratory does not participate in all tests, the times of laboratory participation must be as selected by the laboratory. The times selected must provide for effective monitoring throughout the production schedule.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Visual examination.</E> The visual examination described in § 163.003-21(b) must be conducted as a part of each production test.</P>

              <P>(a) Kapok fibers to be used in a finished product subject to inspection by the Coast Guard shall be subject to inspection and tests at the plant of the manufacturer of such product, who shall furnish the necessary testing tank, test cages, and scales.</P>
              <P>(b) Acceptance of kapok prior to being incorporated into finished products, or during the course of manufacture, shall in no case be construed as a guarantee of the acceptance of the finished product.</P>
              <P>(c) Not less than a one-pound sample from each 1,000 pounds of kapok shall be tested for buoyancy by the inspector. At his discretion, the inspector may select additional samples for tests if deemed advisable.</P>
              <P>(d) The buoyancy test shall be made with 16 ounces of processed kapok uniformly packed in a rigid wire box or cage with metal reinforced edges, and submerged by weights in a tank of fresh water to a depth of 12 inches below the surface of the water, measurement made to the top of box, for 48 hours. The test box shall be cylindrical in shape, and as nearly as practicable <FR>1/3</FR> cubic foot in volume, 4 inches deep, 13.54 inches diameter, all inside measurements; constructed of about 0.065 inch galvanized iron wire with about <FR>1/4</FR> inch mesh, and lined with about 0.007 inch copper wire screen about 18 meshes to the inch, to prevent the kapok from pushing out through the larger wire meshes. At the end of forty-eight hours submergence, the buoyancy shall be determined by subtracting the submerged weight of the box, accessory weights and kapok from the submerged weight of the box and weights without the kapok, and dividing the remainder by the volume of the kapok expressed in cubic feet.</P>
              <P>(e) Kapok fiber shall, at the option of the inspector, be subjected to a microscopic examination to detect adulteration with other fiber.</P>
              <P>(f) Processed kapok shall, at the option of the inspector, be subjected to separation of kapok fibers from foreign matter by hand, the portions of each weighed, and percentage of foreign matter computed for compliance with § 164.003-3(d).</P>

Normal protective coatings and deck attachments shall be incorporated in the samples. Each sample shall be heated in a furnace whose temperature is limited to the standard decking curve reaching 1,325 degrees F. at the end of one hour. Smoke observations shall be made at intervals not greater than five minutes during the one-hour period of test.</P>
              <P>(2) Instantaneous values of the percent of light transmission shall be calculated from the observations noted in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A plot of light transmission values shall be made using straight lines between instantaneous values.</P>
              <P>(3) Any instantaneous value of 10 percent light transmission or less shall be considered sufficient cause for rejection of a deck covering.</P>

              <P>(4) Average values of light transmission shall be calculated for 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Averages shall be an arithmetic mean with values taken at one minute intervals from the plotted curve noted in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If any of the three average values of light transmission is less than the values set forth below, it will be considered sufficient cause for rejection of a deck covering:

              <P>(2) Representative samples of the structural insulation, of a thickness or thicknesses and density as specified in § 164.007-9(a)(5), shall be tested as part of an assembly which forms a portion of a vertical wall of a furnace. The assembly shall be at least 100 cm. × 150 cm. (40″ × 60″) in size. More than one sample may be tested, see § 164.007-7.</P>

              <P>(3) The specimens shall be attached to a 5 ±0.3 mm. (<FR>3/16</FR>″) thick steel plate and mounted in the furnace with the steel plate forming the exterior wall of the furnace. Any stiffening members on the steel plate shall be installed on the face not adjacent to the insulation. Spacer strips of asbestos cement board or similar material, up to 5 cm. (2″) in width, shall be installed around the periphery of the panel. For fibrous insulations, the attachment to the steel plate shall be made by means of 5 mm. (0.19″) diameter steel pins on 30 cm. (12″) centers covered by 18-gage, 4 cm. (1<FR>1/2</FR>″) mesh expanded metal. Alternate methods will be given consideration. <PRTPAGE P="395"/>For other materials, typical installation practice shall be used.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Furnace control.</E> (1) The furnace temperature shall be determined by at least four mineral insulated thermocouples having rapid response, and distributed so as to represent fairly the furnace temperature and to insure as uniform heating as possible. The thermocouples shall be arranged so that the hot junction is approximately 10 cm. from the nearest point of the specimen.</P>
              <P>(2) The furnace temperature shall be continuously controlled so as to follow the standard time-temperature curve within the accuracy specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Testing procedure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Tests.</E> All tests, including the retests, shall be conducted at the National Bureau of Standards or other laboratories designated by the Coast Guard.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Preparation of test specimen.</E> (1) The test specimens shall be conditioned to approximately constant weight with the air being maintained at a relative humidity of 40 to 70 percent and a temperature of 15° to 25 °C. (59° to 77 °F.). After conditioning, but before testing, the temperature of the specimen should not exceed 40 °C. (104 °F.).</P>
              <P>(2) The specimens shall be mounted in the furnace in a vertical position in such a way as to give an exposed surface of at least 4.65 square meters (50 square feet) and a height of at least 2.44 meters (8 feet).</P>
              <P>(3) The specimen shall be supported at the top and secured on the vertical sides and at the bottom in a manner representative of conditions in service. If provision for movement at the edges of a bulkhead panel is made for a particular construction in service, the specimen should stimulate these conditions.</P>
              <P>(4) The method of securing shall be such that there is no possibility of misinterpretation of test results due to the passage of flame at the edges of the specimen when the method of fixing is not the subject of the test.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Furnace control.</E> (1) The furnace temperature shall be determined by at least four mineral insulated thermocouples having rapid response and distributed so as to represent fairly the furnace temperature and to insure as uniform heating as possible. The thermocouples shall be arranged so that the hot junction is approximately 10 cm. (4″) from the nearest point of the specimen.</P>
              <P>(2) The furnace temperature shall be continuously controlled so as to follow the standard time-temperature curve within the accuracy specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) The standard time-temperature curve is defined by a smooth curve drawn through the following points:

              <EXTRACT>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">At the beginning of the test, 20 °C. (68 °F.).</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">At the end of the first 5 minutes, 538 °C. (1,000 °F.).</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">At the end of the first 10 minutes, 704 °C. (1,300 °F.).</FP>

              <FP>For a further definition of the time-temperature curve, see Appendix I of the ASTM Standard E119, “Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials”.</FP>

              <P>(4) The accuracy of the furnace control shall be such that the area under the mean time-temperature curve is within 15 percent of the area under the standard curve during the first 10 minutes of the test, within 10 percent during the first one-half hour, and within 5 percent for any period after the first one-half hour. At any time after the first 10 minutes of the test the mean furnace temperature shall not differ from the standard curve by more than 100 °C. (180 °F.). Consideration will be <PRTPAGE P="400"/>given to adjusting the results for variation of the furnace exposure from that prescribed. If corrections are made, they shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in ASTM E-119.</P>
              <P>(5) The pressure in the furnace shall be equal to that in the laboratory at about one-third of the height of the specimen.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Temperature of unexposed surface.</E> For the unexposed surface temperature measurement, a thermocouple of 0.5 mm. (0.020″) diameter wires shall be soldered centrally with high temperature solder to one surface of a disc of copper 12 mm. diameter and 0.2 mm. thick. The discs shall be covered with an oven-dry asbestos pad 50 mm. × 50 mm. and 4 mm. thick. The disc and the pad may be fixed to the surface of the specimen by pins, tape or a suitable adhesive, depending on the nature of the specimen material. The asbestos pad shall have a density of approximately 1,000 kg./m.<SU>3</SU> and thermal conductivity of 0.11 kcal./m./hr. × C. at 100 °C. (212 °F.).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Flame penetration.</E> (1) Where cracks or openings are formed during the test, an ignition test as prescribed in § 164.008-4(b) shall take place immediately after the appearance of cracks or damage, followed by similar tests at frequent intervals. The purpose of the test is to indicate whether cracks and openings formed during the test are such that they would lead to passage of flame.</P>
              <P>(2) The cotton wool used for the tests prescribed in § 164.008-4(b) shall consist of new undyed soft fibers without any admixture of artificial fibers, and shall be free from thread, leaf, and shell fiber dust. A suitable material for this purpose is sold in the form of rolls for surgical use. A pad shall be cut measuring 10 cm. × 10 cm. approximately 2 cm. thick and weighing between 3 and 4 grams. It shall be oven-dried prior to the test. The pad shall be attached by means of wire clips to a 10 cm. × 10 cm. frame of 1 mm. diameter. A wire handle approximately 75 cm. long attached to the frame would facilitate its use on the specimen.</P>
              <P>(3) When testing for cracks or openings during the test, the pad shall be held in a vertical position facing the crack or opening with the aperture located in a central part of the cotton wool. The pad may be reused if it has not absorbed any moisture or become charred during the previous application.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Temperature observations.</E> (1) All observations shall be taken at intervals not exceeding 5 minutes. The surface temperatures on the unexposed side of the test specimen shall be measured by thermocouples located as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) One thermocouple located approximately in the center of each quadrant of the steel plate (four thermocouples total).</P>
              <P>(ii) One thermocouple close to the center of the test specimen, but away from the joint, if any.</P>
              <P>(iii) At least one thermocouple at the vertical joint of the test specimen.</P>
              <P>(iv) Further thermocouples at the discretion of the testing laboratory or Coast Guard for the purpose of determining the temperature at points deemed likely to give a greater temperature rise than any of the above mentioned thermocouples.</P>
              <P>(2) The average temperature rise on the unexposed surface shall be obtained by averaging the readings of the thermocouples mentioned in paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Other observations.</E> Throughout the test, observations shall be made of all changes and occurrences, which are not criteria of performance but which may create hazard in case of a fire; for example the emission of appreciable volumes of smoke or noxious vapors from the unexposed side of the test specimen. The specimen shall be examined after the test for changes that have taken place and the information shall be noted in the test report.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Duration of testing.</E> The test shall be continued for at least 30 minutes to meet the requirements of § 164.008-2(b) or at least 60 minutes to meet the requirements of § 164.008-2(c). In either case, the test shall be continued until the maximum surface temperature rise values noted in § 164.008-4(a) have been reached, or until cracks which lead to flaming as specified in § 164.008-4(b) are formed.</P>

              <P>(a) Thermal insulation: The insulation value of the specimens for the full scale test shall be such that the average temperature of thermocouples on the unexposed surface described in § 164.008-3(f)(2) will not rise more than 139 °C. (250 °F.) above the initial temperature, nor will the temperature at any point on the surface, including any joint, rise more than 225 °C. (405 °F.) above the initial temperature at the end of 15 minutes. When failure is due to excessive temperature rise on the joint, consideration will be given to alternate joint construction. The results obtained on the small scale test (2′ × 2′) (60 cm. × 60 cm.) shall be recorded.</P>
              <P>(b) The test shall determine the length of time, up to one hour, that the bulkhead panel, including the joint can withstand the passage of flame. Cracks and openings shall not be such as to lead to flaming of a cotton wool test pad as prescribed in § 164.008-3(e)(3) held facing the aperture at about 25 mm. for a period of 30 seconds. If no flaming occurs, the pad shall be removed and reapplied after a suitable interval.</P>

              <P>(a) The purpose of this specification is to set forth the fire protection standards for “Interior Finishes” applied to “Bulkhead Panels” or “Incombustible Materials” approved under subpart 164.008 or 164.009 of this subchapter. The term “Interior Finish” means any coating, overlay, or veneer except standard paint which is applied for decorative or other purpose. It includes not only the visible finish, but all material used in its composition and in its application to the approved “Bulkhead Panel” or “Incombustible Material.” When finishes are applied to both sides of a panel, each must comply with this specification.</P>
              <P>(b) “Interior Finishes” of not more than 0.075″ thickness qualifying under § 164.012-10 and those materials which are described in paragraph (c) of this section, may be used without restriction on all merchant vessels, including those locations where combustible veneers, trim, moldings, and decorations are specifically prohibited by subpart 72.05 of subchapter H (Rules and Regulations for Passenger Vessels) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) With the exception of nitrocellulose or other highly inflammable or noxious fume-producing paints or lacquers (which are prohibited), a limited number of coats of any standard paint, or any “Incombustible Material” approved under subpart 164.009 of this subchapter in any thickness, or a combination thereof, are considered as automatically satisfying the intent of this specification and no test or proof of compliance will be required. Paint may be applied to one or both sides of “Bulkhead Panels” or “Incombustible Materials,” but it shall never be applied as an internal layer in sandwich or laminar construction.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Density.</E> The density of the material shall be determined by dividing the weight of the material by its volume and shall be expressed in pounds per cubic foot. The volume shall be determined by measuring the volume of water displaced by the material or by direct measurement of the specimen using vernier calipers reading to 0.001 inch A sheet specimen 4″ × 4″ × thickness furnished shall be used unless the foam is molded shape, then the largest single piece so molded shall be used.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Buoyancy in fresh water</E>—(1) <E T="03">Specimens.</E> The buoyancy test shall be made with a sample of the sheet material measuring 12″ × 12″ × thickness of material furnished or with the largest molded shape furnished.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Securely attach a spring scale in a position directly over a test tank. Suspend a weighted wire basket from the scale in such a manner that the basket can be weighed while completely submerged in water. Proceed as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Weigh the empty basket under water.</P>
              <P>(ii) Place the sample inside the basket and submerge it so that the top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water. Allow the samples to remain submerged for 24 hours.</P>
              <P>(iii) After 24 hours submergence period, weigh the wire basket with the sample inside while both are still under water.</P>
              <P>(iv) The buoyancy is computed as paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section minus (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The resulting value is divided by the volume of the polyvinyl chloride foam expressed in cubic feet. The final result is in lbs./cu. ft.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Volume loss on heat aging</E>—(1) <E T="03">Specimen.</E> Test specimens shall consist of pieces 4″ × 4″ × the thickness of the material furnished. Where the foam is an object of molded shape, the largest single piece so molded shall be used for this test.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Volume before and after the heat aging test shall be determined by measuring the volume of water displaced by the material. The specimens shall be placed in an oven maintained at 140° ±2 °F., for a period of one week. At the end of that period the specimens shall be removed from the oven and allowed to recover in the open for 5 hours at 70° ±2 °F. before the measurement of final volume is made. The test shall be run in triplicate, the results averaged and the percentage of volume loss calculated.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Compression deflection.</E> Compression deflection shall be determined in accordance with method 12151 of Federal Standard 601, except that the deflection shall be maintained at 25 percent with automatic or manual control, and the load observed and recorded 60 seconds after the 25 percent deflection is reached.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Compression set</E>—(1) <E T="03">Specimens.</E> The specimens shall have parallel top and bottom surfaces which shall be at right angles to the side surfaces. The specimen may be cylindrical or rectangular. The minimum dimension across the top shall be at least 1.0 times the thickness and the top a minimum of 1 square inch in area, and a maximum of 16 square inches in area.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Apparatus.</E> The apparatus shall consist of a compression device with two parallel plates, between which the test specimen shall be compressed by means of four studs and nuts. The plates may be steel, aluminum or any rigid smooth metal of sufficient thickness to withstand the required compression stresses without bending. The surfaces against which the test specimens are held shall be smooth and shall be thoroughly cleaned and wiped dry before each test. Metal shims inserted between the plates shall be used to limit the compression of the specimen.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Thickness, before and after the compression set test shall be measured as specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. The test specimens shall be compressed 25% of the original thickness for 22 hours. At the end of that period, the test specimens shall be removed from the set apparatus and allowed to rest for 24 hours before measurement of final thickness is made. The compression set shall be calculated by means of the following formula:

The retroreflective material on each test panel is cut with a sharp knife from each corner to the corner diagonally opposite so that an “X” is formed. The cuts must be made completely through the material to the metal panel. One panel is immersed in distilled water in a covered container. The other panel is immersed in salt water (4% NaCl by weight) in a covered container. After 16 hours in water, the panels are removed from the containers, rinsed of deposits, and dried. Reflective intensity values at the angles listed in Table 164.018-9 must be measured within 2 hours after removal of the panels from the water. When measuring the reflective intensity values, the area within 5 mm (0.2 in.) of either side of the “X” cuts, and within 5 mm of the cut edges of the material, must not be counted.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Abrasion resistance.</E> One test panel is used. The panel and test conditions must meet paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. The test apparatus must meet Federal Test Method Standard 141, Method 6142, except that the brush must be dry. One thousand brush strokes are applied to the material. The test panel is then wiped with a clean soft cloth. Thereafter, the reflective intensity of the area of the material in contact with the brush is measured at the angles listed in Table 164.018-9.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Soil resistance and cleanability.</E> One panel is used. The test panel and test conditions must meet paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

              <P>(j) <E T="03">Accept/reject criteria.</E> (1) A component lot passes production testing and is therefore accepted if each sample tested passes each test.</P>
              <P>(2) A lot having a production test failure may be accepted if it meets the following additional test requirements.</P>
              <P>(i) When the basis of acceptability is an average result, a second sampling with an identical number of samples is taken. The results of this second sampling must be averaged with the initial results. If the average result passes the test, then the lot may be accepted.</P>
              <P>(ii) When the basis of acceptability is individual sample results, a second sampling is taken. The size of the second sampling must be as specified in the subpart of this part which covers the component. If each sample in this sampling passes the test, the lot may be accepted.</P>
              <P>(3) A rejected lot of components may be resubmitted for testing, examination, or inspection if—</P>
              <P>(i) The manufacturer first removes each component having the same type of defect or;</P>
              <P>(ii) After obtaining authorization from the Commandant or the recognized laboratory, the manufacturer reworks the lot to correct the defect.</P>
              <P>(4) A rejected lot or rejected component may not be sold or offered for sale with the representation that it meets the requirements of this subpart or is accepted by the Coast Guard, and may not be used in the construction of Coast Guard-approved PFDs.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Facilities and equipment</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The manufacturer shall provide the test equipment and facilities for performing production tests, examinations, and inspections described in the applicable subpart of this part and in the quality control and oversight procedures submitted in accordance with § 164.019-7(c) (8) and (9).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Calibration.</E> The manufacturer shall have the calibration of all test equipment checked at least every 6 months by a weights and measures agency or by the equipment manufacturer, distributor, or dealer.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Facilities for inspector's use.</E> The manufacturer shall provide a suitable place and the necessary apparatus for the inspector to use in conducting or supervising tests. For the detailed product examination, the manufacturer shall provide a suitable working environment and a smooth-top table for the inspector's use.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Access to facilities.</E> The manufacturer shall permit the inspector to have access to any place in the factory where work is being done on PFD components or where components are stored. The inspector may take samples of parts or materials entering into production or completed components, for further examinations, inspections, or tests.</P>
              <P>(l) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Alternate procedures for standard components.</E> In lieu of the quality control procedures specified in this section, manufacturers of standard components may follow the quality control procedures in a Federal or military specification with which the component is required to comply by this subchapter, or equivalent procedures accepted by the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Additional tests.</E> The Commandant may prescribe additional production tests and inspections to maintain quality control. A representative of the Commandant may conduct inspections for compliance with the requirements of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(a) Manufacturers that desire type approval should submit a written notice to the Commandant (CG-ENG-4) <PRTPAGE P="443"/>describing the product and its intended uses. The Commandant will evaluate this information and notify the manufacturer of the product's suitability for testing. The manufacturer should then contract directly with an accepted independent laboratory to perform the required tests and inspections.</P>

              <P>(b) Upon completion of the required testing and inspections, the manufacturer must submit either a written request for type approval to the Commandant (CG-ENG-4), United States Coast Guard, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Stop 7509, Washington, DC 20593-7509, or electronically submit a request to <E T="03">typeapproval@uscg.mil</E>. The request must indicate the name and address of the manufacturer, all product designations, and the address of all manufacturing facilities. The request must include a copy of the final fire test report and the production inspection procedures. From the information submitted, the Commandant determines whether or not the product is acceptable for type approval. If the product is determined to be acceptable, a type approval certificate valid for a 5-year period will be issued. If the product is not accepted, the manufacturer will be notified of the reasons why.</P>

              <P>(c) To be approved for smoke and toxicity requirements, piping systems must meet the requirements of Annex 1, Part 2 of the FTP Code (incorporated by reference, see § 164.141-2) with the following modifications:</P>
              <P>(1) Plastic piping meeting paragraph 2.2 of Annex 2 of the FTP Code as having very low flame spread when tested to Part 5 are deemed to meet the smoke and toxicity requirements without testing to Part 2.</P>
              <P>(2) Testing need only be conducted on piping sizes with the maximum and minimum wall thicknesses intended to be approved.</P>

              <P>(3) The test sample should be fabricated by cutting pipes lengthwise <PRTPAGE P="448"/>into individual sections and then assembling the sections into a test sample as representative as possible of a flat surface. All cuts should be made normal to the pipe wall.</P>
              <P>(4) The number of sections that must be assembled together to form a square test sample with sides measuring 3 inches, should be that which corresponds to the nearest integral number of sections which will result in a test sample with an equivalent linearized surface width between 3 and 3 <FR>1/2</FR> inches. The surface width is defined as the measured sum of the outer circumference of the assembled pipe sections normal to the lengthwise sections.</P>
              <P>(5) The test samples should be mounted on calcium silicate board and held in place by the edges of the test frame and, if necessary, by wire. There should be no gaps between individual sections and the samples should be constructed so that the edges of two adjacent sections coincide with the centerline of the test holder.</P>
              <P>(6) The space between the concave unexposed surface of the test sample and the surface of the calcium silicate backing should be left void.</P>
              <P>(7) The void space between the top of the exposed test surface and the bottom edge of the sample holder frame should be filled with a high temperature insulating wool where the pipe extends under the frame.</P>
              <P>(8) When the pipes are to include fireproofing or coatings, the composite structure consisting of the segmented pipe wall and fireproofing shall be tested and the thickness of the fireproofing should be the minimum thickness specified for the intended usage.</P>
              <P>(9) Test samples should be oriented in the apparatus such that the pilot burner flame will be normal to the lengthwise piping sections.</P>
              <P>(d) Where required to be approved, piping systems must comply with the non-metallic materials requirements in 46 CFR 56.60-25(a)(1).</P>

              <P>(e) All testing and inspections required by this subpart, except as allowed by paragraph (b) of this section, must be performed by an independent laboratory accepted by the Coast Guard under subpart 159.010 of this chapter. A list of independent laboratories accepted as meeting subpart 159.010 of this chapter is available online at <E T="03">http://psix.uscg.mil/EQLabs/Default.aspx</E>.</P>
              <P>(f) The independent laboratory must perform an initial factory inspection to select the test specimens and establish the materials of construction, chemical make-up, dimensions, tolerances, and other related factors needed to confirm product consistency during follow-up production inspections.</P>
              <P>(g) Production inspections must be performed by the independent laboratory in accordance with subpart 159.007 of this chapter at least annually to confirm that no changes have been made to the product that may adversely affect its fire performance as plastic piping.</P>
              <P>(h) The independent laboratory must prepare production inspection procedures and a report of the results of the fire testing program, and must furnish the manufacturer with three copies of each upon completion of the required testing.</P>
              <P>(i) Materials approved under this subpart must be shipped in packaging that is clearly marked with the name of the manufacturer, product designation, date of manufacture, batch or lot number, and Coast Guard type approval number.</P>

The Commandant will evaluate this information and notify the manufacturer of the product's suitability for testing. The manufacturer should then contract directly with an accepted independent laboratory to perform the required tests and inspections.</P>

              <P>(b) Upon completion of the required testing and inspections, the manufacturer must submit either a written request for type approval to the Commandant (CG-ENG-4), United States Coast Guard, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Stop 7509, Washington, DC 20593-7509, or electronically submit a request to <E T="03">typeapproval@uscg.mil.</E> The request must indicate the name and address of the manufacturer, all product designations, and the address of all manufacturing facilities. The request <PRTPAGE P="449"/>must include a copy of the final fire test report and the production inspection procedures. From the information submitted, the Commandant determines whether or not the product is acceptable for type approval. If the product is determined to be acceptable, a type approval certificate valid for a 5-year period will be issued. If the product is not accepted, the manufacturer will be notified of the reasons why.</P>
