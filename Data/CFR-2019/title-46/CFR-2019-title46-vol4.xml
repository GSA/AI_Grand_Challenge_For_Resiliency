      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2018), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) Each seagoing barge, as defined in 46 CFR 90.10-36, is subject to inspection and certification; except that a seagoing barge is exempt from those requirements if it is unmanned for the purposes of operating or navigating the barge, and carries neither a hazardous material as cargo nor a flammable or combustible liquid, including oil, in bulk quantities of 250 barrels or more.</P>

When it is determined by the Commandant that the gross register tonnage for a particular manned seagoing barge, which is attained by exemptions, reductions, or other devices in the basic gross tonnage formulation, will circumvent or be incompatible with the application of specific safety requirements in the regulations in this subchapter for a manned seagoing barge of such physical size, the Commandant shall prescribe the regulations to be made applicable to such seagoing barge. When the Commandant <PRTPAGE P="8"/>determines that the gross register tonnage is not a valid criterion for the invocation of safety requirements based on relative size, the parties involved will be informed of the determination and of the regulations applicable to such manner seagoing barges, and before being permitted to operate such seagoing barges, compliance therewith shall be required. Endorsements or notations on the seagoing barge's certificate of inspection may be made as appropriate.</P>

              <P>(a) Each fuel oil tank with at least one side integral to the vessel's hull and located within the hull (“integral fuel oil tank”) is subject to inspection as provided in this section. The owner or operator of the vessel shall have the <PRTPAGE P="26"/>tanks cleaned out and gas freed as necessary to permit internal examination of the tank or tanks designated by the marine inspector. The owner or operator shall arrange for an examination of the fuel tanks of each vessel during an internal structural examination at intervals not to exceed five years.</P>
              <P>(b) Integral non-double-bottom fuel oil tanks need not be cleaned out and internally examined if the marine inspector is able to determine by external examination that the general condition of the tanks is satisfactory.</P>
              <P>(c) Double-bottom fuel oil tanks on vessels less than 10 years of age need not be cleaned out and internally examined if the marine inspector is able to determine by external examination that the general condition of the tanks is satisfactory.</P>
              <P>(d) All double-bottom fuel oil tanks on vessels 10 years of age or older but less than 15 years of age need not be cleaned out and internally examined if the marine inspector is able to determine by internal examination of at least one forward double-bottom fuel oil tank, and by external examination of all other double-bottom fuel oil tanks on the vessel, that the general condition of the tanks is satisfactory.</P>
              <P>(e) All double-bottom fuel oil tanks on vessels 15 years of age or older but less than 25 years of age need not be cleaned out and internally examined if the marine inspector is able to determine by internal examination of at least one forward, one amidships, and one aft double-bottom fuel oil tank, and by external examination of all other double-bottom fuel oil tanks on the vessel, that the general condition of the tanks is satisfactory.</P>
              <P>(f) All double-bottom fuel oil tanks on vessels 25 years of age or older need not be cleaned out and internally examined if the marine inspector is able to determine by internal examination of at least one double-bottom fuel oil tank in way of each cargo hold/tank, and by external examination of all other double-bottom fuel oil tanks, that the general condition of the tanks is satisfactory.</P>

In this case, the plans will be returned directly to the submitter, with a copy of the action being forwarded to the interested Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.</P>

              <P>(3) The plans may be submitted by visitors directly to Commanding Officer, U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Center, 1900 Half Street, SW., Suite 1000, Room 525, Washington, DC 20024, or transmitted by mail to: Commanding Officer, U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Center, 2100 2nd St., SW., Stop 7102, Washington, DC 20593-7102, in a written or electronic format. Information for submitting the VSP electronically can be found at <E T="03">http://www.uscg.mil/HQ/MSC.</E> In this case, the plans will be returned directly to the submitter, with a copy of the action being forwarded to the interested Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.</P>
              <P>(4) In the case of classed vessels, upon specific request by the submitter, the American Bureau of Shipping will arrange to forward the necessary plans to the Coast Guard indicating its action thereon. In this case, the plans will be returned as noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) The American Bureau of Shipping, with its home office at ABS Plaza, 16855 Northchase Drive, Houston, TX 77060, is hereby designated as an organization duly authorized to issue the “Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate” to certain cargo ships on behalf of the United States of America as provided in Regulation 12, chapter I, of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, and Executive Order 12234 and the certificate shall be subject to the requirements in this subpart. The American Bureau of Shipping is authorized to place the official seal of the United States of America on the certificate. This designation and delegation to the American Bureau of Shipping shall be in effect until terminated by proper authority and notice of cancellation is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) At the option of the owner or agent of a vessel on an international voyage and on direct application to the American Bureau of Shipping, the Bureau may issue to such vessel a Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate, having a period of validity of not more than 60 months after ascertaining that the vessel:</P>
              <P>(1) Has met the applicable requirements of the Convention; and,</P>
              <P>(2) Is currently classed by the Bureau and classification requirements have been dealt with to the satisfaction of the Bureau.</P>

              <P>(c) When the Bureau determines that a vessel to which it has issued a Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate no longer complies with the Bureau's applicable requirements for classification, the Bureau shall immediately furnish to the Coast Guard all relevant information, which will be used by the Coast Guard to determine whether or not to withdraw, revoke or suspend the <PRTPAGE P="31"/>Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate.</P>

              <P>(1) From the conning position, the view of the sea surface is not obscured forward of the bow by more than the lesser of two ship lengths or 500 meters (1,640 feet) from dead ahead to 10 degrees on either side of the vessel. Within this arc of visibility any blind sector caused by cargo, cargo gear, or other permanent obstruction must not exceed 5 degrees.</P>
              <P>(2) From the conning position, the horizontal field of vision extends over an arc from at least 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on one side of the vessel, through dead ahead, to at least 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on the other side of the vessel. Blind sectors forward of the beam caused by cargo, cargo gear, or other permanent obstruction must not exceed 10 degrees each, nor total more than 20 degrees, including any blind sector within the arc of visibility described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) From each bridge wing, the field of vision extends over an arc from at least 45 degrees on the opposite bow, through dead ahead, to at least dead astern.</P>
              <P>(4) From the main steering position, the field of vision extends over and arc from dead ahead to at least 60 degrees on either side of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(5) From each bridge wing, the respective side of the vessel is visible forward and aft.</P>
              <P>(b) Windows fitted on the navigation bridge must be arranged so that:</P>
              <P>(1) Framing between windows is kept to a minimum and is not installed immediately in front of any work station.</P>

              <P>(2) Front windows are inclined from the vertical plane, top out, at an angle <PRTPAGE P="33"/>of not less than 10 degrees and not more than 25 degrees.</P>
              <P>(3) The height of the lower edge of the front windows is limited to prevent any obstruction of the forward view previously described in this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The height of the upper edge of the front windows allows a forward view of the horizon at the conning position, for a person with a height of eye of 1.8 meters (71 inches), when the vessel is at a forward pitch angle of 20 degrees.</P>
              <P>(c) Polarized or tinted windows must not be fitted.</P>

                  <SU>1</SU> On vessels of 65 feet (19.8 meters) in length or less, <FR>3/4</FR>-inch hose of a good commercial grade together with a commercial garden hose nozzle may be used. The pump may be hand operated and the length of hose must be sufficient to assure coverage of all parts of the vessel.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>
                  <SU>2</SU> A 1<FR>1/2</FR> inch hose that is 75 feet (22.86 meters) in length with a <FR>5/8</FR>-inch nozzle may be used where specified by § 95.10-10(b) of this subpart for interior locations and 50 feet (15.24 meters) of 1<FR>1/2</FR> inch hose may be used in exterior locations on vessels in other than ocean or coastwise service. For vessels on ocean or coastwise service, two 1<FR>1/2</FR> inch outlets, each provided with one 1<FR>1/2</FR> inch hose supplied through a wye connection may be substituted.</TNOTE>
              </GPOTABLE>
              <P>(b) On vessels of 1,000 gross tons or more on an international voyage, each required fire pump, while delivering water thru the fire main system at a pressure corresponding to that required by paragraph (c) of this section, must have a minimum capacity of at least two-thirds of that required for an independent bilge pump. However, in no case may the capacity of each fire pump be less than that otherwise required by this section.</P>
              <P>(c) Each pump must be capable of delivering water simultaneously from the two highest outlets at a Pitot tube pressure of approximately 50 p.s.i. Where 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose is permitted in lieu of 2<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose by footnote 2 of Table 95.10-5(a), the pump capacity must be determined on the same basis as if 2<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose had been permitted. Where <FR>3/4</FR>-inch hose is permitted by Table 95.10-5(a), the Pitot tube pressure need be only 35 p.s.i.</P>
              <P>(d) Fire pumps must be fitted on the discharge side with relief valves set to relieve at 25 p.s.i. in excess of the pressure necessary to maintain the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section or 125 p.s.i., whichever is greater. Relief valves may be omitted if the pumps, operating under shut-off conditions, are not capable of developing a pressure exceeding this amount.</P>
              <P>(e) Fire pumps must be fitted with a pressure gage on the discharge side of the pumps.</P>
              <P>(f) Fire pumps may be used for other purposes provided at least one of the required pumps is kept available for use on the fire system at all times. In no case shall a pump having connection to an oil line be used as a fire pump. Branch lines connected to the fire main for purposes other than fire and deck wash shall be so arranged that adequate water can be made continuously available for firefighting purposes.</P>
              <P>(g) The total area of the pipes leading from a pump must not be less than the discharge area of the pump.</P>
              <P>(h) On vessels with oil fired boilers, either main or auxiliary, or with internal combustion propulsion machinery, where two fire pumps are required, they shall be located in separate spaces, and the arrangement of pumps, sea connections, and sources of power shall be such as to insure that a fire in any one space will not put all of the fire pumps out of operation. However, when it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that it is unreasonable or impracticable to meet this requirement due to the size or arrangement of the vessel, or for other reasons, the installation of a total flooding fixed fire extinguishing or clean agent system may be accepted as an alternate method of extinguishing any fire that could affect the powering and operation of at least one of the required fire pumps.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fire hydrants and hose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The size of fire hydrants, hose, and nozzles and the length of hose required must be as noted in Table 95.10-5(a).</P>

              <P>(b) Instead of the 2<FR>1/2</FR>-in hose and hydrants specified in Table 95.10-5(a) of this subpart, on vessels of more than 1,500 gross tons:<PRTPAGE P="46"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) The hydrants in interior locations may have wye connections for 1<FR>1/2</FR>-in hoses. In these cases, the hose must be 75 ft in length, and only one hose is required at each fire station; however, if all such stations can be satisfactorily served with 50-ft lengths, a 50-ft hose may be used; and</P>
              <P>(2) The hydrants for exterior locations may substitute two 1<FR>1/2</FR> in outlets, each with a 1<FR>1/2</FR>-in hose, supplied through a wye connection.</P>
              <P>(c) On vessels of 500 gross tons or more there must be at least one shore connection to the fire main available to each side of the vessel in an accessible location. Suitable cut-out valves and check valves must be provided. Suitable adapters also must be provided for furnishing the vessel's shore connections with couplings mating those on the shore fire lines. Vessels of 500 gross tons or more on an international voyage, must be provided with at least one international shore connection complying with ASTM F 1121 (incorporated by reference, see § 95.01-2). Facilities must be available enabling an international connection to be used on either side of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(d) Fire hydrants must be of sufficient number and so located that any part of the vessel, other than main machinery spaces, accessible to persons on board while the vessel is being navigated and all cargo holds may be reached with at least 2 streams of water from separate outlets, at least one of which must be from a single length of hose. In main machinery spaces, all portions of such spaces must be capable of being reached by at least 2 streams of water, each of which must be from a single length of hose from separate outlets; however, this requirement need not apply to shaft alleys containing no assigned space for the stowage of combustibles. Fire hydrants must be numbered as required by § 97.37-15 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(e) All parts of the fire main located on exposed decks must either be protected against freezing or be fitted with cut-out valves and drain valves so that the entire exposed parts of such piping may be shut off and drained in freezing weather. Except when closed to prevent freezing, such valves must be sealed open.</P>
              <P>(f) The outlet at the fire hydrant must be limited to any position from the horizontal to the vertical pointing downward, so that the hose will lead horizontally or downward to minimize the possibility of kinking.</P>
              <P>(g) Each fire hydrant must have at least one length of firehose, a spanner wrench, and a hose rack or other device for stowing the hose.</P>
              <P>(h) Firehose must be connected to the outlets at all times. However, on open decks where no protection is afforded to the hose in heavy weather, or where the hose may be liable to damage from the handling of cargo, the hose may be temporarily removed from the hydrant and stowed in an accessible nearby location.</P>
              <P>(i) Each firehose on each hydrant must have a combination solid stream and water spray firehose nozzle approved under subpart 162.027 of this chapter. Firehose nozzles previously approved under subpart 162.027 of this chapter may be retained so long as they are maintained in good condition to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.</P>
              <P>(j) In each propulsion machinery space containing an oil fired boiler, internal combustion machinery, or oil fuel unit on a vessel on an international voyage or of 1000 gross tons or more, each firehose having a combination nozzle previously approved under subpart 162.027 of this chapter must have a low-velocity water spray applicator that is also previously approved under subpart 162.027 of this chapter. The length of the applicator must be less than 1.8 meters (6 feet).</P>
              <P>(k) Fixed brackets, hooks, or other means for stowing an applicator must be next to each fire hydrant that has an applicator under paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(l) Firehose must not be used for any other purpose than fire extinguishing, drills, and testing.</P>
              <P>(m) Fire hydrants, nozzles, and other fittings must have threads to accommodate the hose connections noted in paragraph (l) of this section.</P>
              <P>(n) Firehose and couplings must be as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) Fire station hydrant connections must be brass, bronze, or other equivalent metal. Couplings must either:<PRTPAGE P="47"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Use National Standard firehose coupling threads for the 1<FR>1/2</FR> inch (38 millimeter) and 2<FR>1/2</FR> inch (64 millimeter) hose sizes, i.e., 9 threads per inch for 1<FR>1/2</FR> inch hose, and 7<FR>1/2</FR> threads per inch for 2<FR>1/2</FR> inch hose; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Be a uniform design for each hose diameter throughout the vessel.</P>
              <P>(2) Where 19 millimeters (<FR>3/4</FR> inch) hose is permitted by table 95.10-5(a), the hose and couplings must be of good commercial grade.</P>
              <P>(3) Each section of firehose must be lined commercial firehose that conforms to Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc. Standard 19 or Federal Specification ZZ-H-451E. Hose that bears the label of Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc. as lined firehose is accepted as conforming to this requirement.</P>

              <P>(b) If the same cylinders are used to protect more than one hazard, a manifold with normally closed stop valves shall be used to direct the carbon dioxide into the proper space. If cylinders are used to protect only one hazard, a normally closed stop valve shall be installed between the cylinders and the hazard except for systems of the type indicated in § 95.15-5(d) which contain not more than 300 pounds of carbon dioxide.</P>

              <P>(c) Distribution piping to the various cargo spaces shall be controlled from not more than two stations. One of the stations controlling the system for the main machinery space shall be located as convenient as practicable to one of the main escapes from the space. All control stations and the individual valves and controls shall be marked as <PRTPAGE P="50"/>required by §§ 97.37-10 and 97.37-13 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(d) Systems of the type indicated in § 95.15-5(d) shall be actuated by one control operating the valve to the space and a separate control releasing at least the required amount of carbon dioxide. These two controls shall be located in a box or other enclosure clearly identified for the particular space. Those systems installed without a stop valve shall be operated by one control releasing at least the required amount of carbon dioxide.</P>
              <P>(e) Where provisions are made for the simultaneous release of a given amount of carbon dioxide by operation of a remote control, provisions shall also be made for manual control at the cylinders. Where gas pressure from pilot cylinders is used as a means for releasing the remaining cylinders, not less than two pilot cylinders shall be used for systems consisting of more than two cylinders. Each of the pilot cylinders shall be capable of manual control at the cylinder, but the remaining cylinders need not be capable of individual manual control.</P>
              <P>(f) Systems of the type indicated in § 95.15-5(d), other than systems for tanks, which are of more than 300 pounds of carbon dioxide, shall be fitted with an approved delayed discharge so arranged that the alarm will be sounded for at least 20 seconds before the carbon dioxide is released into the space. Such systems of not more than 300 pounds of carbon dioxide shall also have a similar delayed discharge, except for those systems for tanks and for spaces which have a suitable horizontal escape. This paragraph shall be applicable only to systems installed on or after July 1, 1957.</P>

              <P>(2) The piping from the cylinders to the stop valves in the manifold shall be subjected to a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch. With no additional gas being introduced to the system, it shall be demonstrated that the leakage of the system is such as not to permit a pressure drop of more than 150 pounds per square inch per minute for a 2-minute period.</P>
              <P>(3) The individual branch lines to the various spaces protected shall be subjected to a test similar to that described in the preceding paragraph with the exception that the pressure used shall be 600 pounds per square inch in lieu of 1,000 pounds per square inch. For the purpose of this test, the distribution piping shall be capped within the space protected at the first joint ahead of the nozzles.</P>
              <P>(4) In lieu of the tests prescribed in paragraphs (j) (1) through (3) of this section, small independent systems protecting spaces such as emergency generator rooms, lamp lockers, etc., may be tested by blowing out the piping with air at a pressure of at least 100 pounds per square inch.</P>

              <P>(a) A lockout valve must be provided on any carbon dioxide extinguishing system protecting a space over 6,000 cubic feet in volume and installed or altered after July 9, 2013. “Altered” means modified or refurbished beyond the maintenance required by the manufacturer's design, installation, operation and maintenance manual.</P>
              <P>(b) The lockout valve must be a manually operated valve located in the discharge manifold prior to the stop valve or selector valves. When in the closed position, the lockout valve must provide complete isolation of the system from the protected space or spaces, making it impossible for carbon dioxide to discharge in the event of equipment failure during maintenance.</P>
              <P>(c) The lockout valve design or locking mechanism must make it obvious whether the valve is open or closed.</P>
              <P>(d) A valve is considered a lockout valve if it has a hasp or other means of attachment to which, or through which, a lock can be affixed, or it has a locking mechanism built into it.</P>
              <P>(e) The master or person-in-charge must ensure that the valve is locked open at all times, except while maintenance is being performed on the extinguishing system, when the valve must be locked in the closed position.</P>
              <P>(f) Lockout valves added to existing systems must be approved by the Commandant as part of the installed system.</P>

              <P>(2) A vessel engaged in a voyage exclusively on Great Lakes waters and having 6 feet or more of freeboard, measured vertically from the water's edge at the lowest point of sheer to the top of deck at the ship's side, may, at the master's discretion, omit tarpaulins on the ship's hatches from 16 May through 15 September (both dates inclusive). This exemption does not relieve the master of any responsibility for the securing and protection of his hatches during the interval of exemption and, in case of indications of bad weather or other threatening conditions, he shall not leave protected waters until the exposed cargo hatches and other openings in the hull of his vessel are properly covered, secured and protected.</P>
              <P>(b) The openings to which this section applies are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Exposed cargo hatches.</P>

              <P>(c) Vessels which, by their design, do not require cargo hatch closing devices and to which § 45.01-20 of subchapter E (Load Lines) of this chapter applies need not comply with the requirements of this section as to exposed cargo hatches.</P>

              <P>(d) The master at his discretion may permit hatches or other openings to remain uncovered or open, or to be uncovered or opened for reasonable purposes such as ship's maintenance while the vessel is being navigated: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That in his opinion existing conditions warrant such action.</P>
              <P>(e) In the event the master employs the discretionary provisions of this section after leaving port he shall cause appropriate entries to be made in the official log or equivalent thereof setting forth the time of uncovering, opening, closing or covering of the hatches or other openings to which this section applies and the circumstances warranting the action taken.</P>

(SOLAS 74), which is: “a voyage from a country to which the present Convention applies to a port outside such country, or conversely. The Coast Guard has interpreted this definition to include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A voyage from a country to which SOLAS 1974 applies, to a port outside that country or the reverse;</P>
              <P>(2) A voyage from any territory, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, all possessions of the United States, and all lands held by the United States under a protectorate or mandate, whose international relations are the responsibility of a contracting SOLAS 74 government, or which is administered by the United Nations, to a port outside that territory or the reverse;</P>

              <FP>The Coast Guard has interpreted this definition to not include a “Great Lakes voyage” which means a voyage solely on the Great Lakes of North America and the St. Lawrence River west of a straight line drawn from <PRTPAGE P="119"/>Capedes Rosiers to West Point, Anticosti Island and, on the north side of Anticosti Island, the 63rd Meridian.</FP>

The Administration may exempt any ship which embodies features of a novel kind from any of the provisions of Chapters II-1, II-2, III and IV of these Regulations the application of which might seriously impede research into the development of such features and their incorporation in ships engaged on international voyages. Any such ship shall, however, comply with safety requirements which, in the opinion of that Administration, are adequate for the service for which it is intended and are such as to ensure the overall safety of the ship and which are acceptable to the Governments of the States to be visited by the ship. The Administration which allows any such exemption shall communicate to the Organization particulars of same and the reasons therefor which the Organization shall circulate to the Contracting Governments for their information.</P>

              <P>Survival craft launching and recovery arrangements, in addition to meeting the requirements in § 108.550, must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(a) Each fall wire must be of rotation-resistant and corrosion-resistant steel wire rope.</P>
              <P>(b) The breaking strength of each fall wire and each attachment used on the fall must be at least six times the load imparted on the fall by the fully-loaded survival craft.</P>
              <P>(c) Each fall must be long enough for the survival craft to reach the water with the unit in its lightest seagoing condition, under unfavorable conditions of trim and with the unit listed not less than 20 degrees either way.</P>
              <P>(d) Each unguarded fall must not pass near any operating position of the winch, such as hand cranks, payout wheels, and brake levers.</P>
              <P>(e) Each winch drum must be arranged so the fall wire winds onto the drum in a level wrap, and a multiple drum winch must be arranged so that the falls wind off at the same rate when lowering, and onto the drums at the same rate when hoisting.</P>
              <P>(f) Each fall, where exposed to damage or fouling, must have guards or equivalent protection. Each fall that leads along a deck must be covered with a guard that is not more than 300 millimeters (1 foot) above the deck.</P>
              <P>(g) The lowering speed for a fully loaded survival craft must be not less than that obtained from the following formula:</P>
              <P>(1) S = 0.4 + (0.02 H), where S is the speed of lowering in meters per second, and H is the height in meters from the davit head to the waterline at the lightest seagoing condition, with H not greater than 30, regardless of the lowering height.</P>
              <P>(2) S = 79 + (1.2 H), where S is the speed of lowering in feet per minute, and H is the height in feet, with H not greater than 99.</P>

              <P>(i) The lowering speed for a fully loaded survival craft must be not more than 1.3 meters per second (256 feet per minute).</P>
              <P>(j) If a survival craft is recovered by electric power, the electrical installation, including the electric power-operated boat winch, must meet the requirements in subchapter J of this chapter. If a survival craft is recovered by any means of power, including a portable power source, safety devices must be provided which automatically cut off the power before the davit arms or falls reach the stops in order to avoid overstressing the falls or davits, unless the motor is designed to prevent such overstressing.</P>
              <P>(k) Each launching appliance must be fitted with brakes that meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The brakes must be capable of stopping the descent of the survival craft or rescue boat and holding it securely when loaded with it full complement of persons and equipment.</P>
              <P>(2) The brake pads must, where necessary, be protected from water and oil.</P>
              <P>(3) Manual brakes must be arranged so that the brake is always applied unless the operator, or a mechanism activated by the operator, holds the brake control in the off position.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 109—Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular No. 4-78—Inspection and Certification of Existing Mobile Offshore Drilling Units</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Purpose.</E> To promulgate instructions for the inspection and certification of existing mobile offshore drilling units. This NVIC is also being published as appendix A of 46 CFR Subchapter IA.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Background.</E> Mobile Offshore Drilling Units are recognized internationally through the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization as being a “special purpose ship” designed and operated to carry out an industrial function at sea. Contemporary U.S. Vessel regulations in Title 46 CFR do not adequately cover the safety considerations which are unique to the hull and structural designs, industrial equipment and operating procedures incorporated in drilling vessels. To provide appropriate and adequate standards, the Coast Guard with the assistance of the National Offshore Operations Advisory Committee, and following the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act, developed Subchapter IA, Regulations for Mobile Offshore Drilling Units, 46 CFR Parts 107-109 and amendments to 46 CFR Subchapters “F”, Marine Engineering Regulations, and “J”, Electrical Engineering Regulations. These regulations, published in <E T="04">Federal Register</E> (43 FR 56788 December 4, 1978) will apply to all units contracted for on or after the effective date of the regulations.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Discussion.</E> a. This NVIC elaborates the “grandfather provisions” of 46 CFR 107.211 and 107.215 in applying Subchapter IA to the approximately 150 <E T="03">existing</E> ocean-going U.S. flag mobile offshore drilling units. “Existing” Mobile Offshore Drilling Units are those vessels which have been contracted for before the effective date of the regulations including:</P>
              <P>(1) Units in Service.</P>
              <P>(2) Units under construction.</P>
              <P>(3) Units contracted for which are to be constructed and delivered prior to January 1, 1981.</P>
              <P>b. Existing <E T="03">uncertificated</E> mobile drilling units of which there are approximately 92 of the bottom bearing configuration, i.e., jack-up and submersible types, have not previously been required to comply with vessel inspection regulations. Some units have met the load line requirements of Subchapter “E” for International Voyages. Many of the older units are not classed by a classification society. Bottom bearing units operating on the Outer Continental Shelf of United States have been required to meet the safety requirements of 33 CFR Subchapter “N” as artificial islands. On January 3, 1979, existing bottom bearing units are subject to the “grandfather provisions” in § 107.211(c) of Subchapter IA.</P>
              <P>c. Existing <E T="03">certificated</E> mobile offshore drilling units, for the purposes of this NVIC, are column-stabilized and ship-shape types of which approximately 58 are currently certificated, or have made application for an original Certificate of Inspection or intend to make application for an original inspection for certification under 46 CFR Subchapter “I” on the basis of the unit being contracted for prior to the effective date of the new regulations. These units may continue to meet the structural, equipment, material and arrangement standards which were applicable to the hull, engineering, electrical and industrial systems when the units were contracted for. In addition they must meet the provisions of d.(1), d.(4)(d), d.(7)(b), d.(8), d.(9), d.(10)(b), d.(11) and d.(12) of paragraph 3 of this NVC in accordance with § 107.215(c)(2) of Subchapter IA.</P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">Inspection Provisions for Existing Uncertificated Units.</E> The intent of the “grandfather” provisions of this NVIC for existing uncertificated units is to ascertain through inspection that the material condition of the unit and its equipment meet reasonable levels of safety. To this end, the following determinations will be made:</P>
              <P>• The design, construction and arrangements of the hull, machinery electrical and industrial systems do not reveal manifestly unsafe aspects.</P>
              <P>• There is no excessive deterioration of the hull structure or equipment foundations.</P>
              <P>• There are no intrinsic fire or explosion hazards.</P>
              <P>• There are no personnel hazards such as unguarded moving machinery, potential electrical shock conditions or lack of handrails.</P>
              <P>• The unit is seaworthy and exhibits satisfactory stability.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (a) Repairs and minor alterations to hull structure or equipment may be made to the same standards as the original installation. However, new installations or major alterations which affect vessel or personnel safety shall meet the applicable standards of Subchapter IA.</P>

              <P>(b) Existing items of safety equipment not meeting the applicable specifications or requirements set forth in Subchapter IA may be continued in service as long as they are maintained in good working order to the satisfaction of the OCMI. Such safety equipment and installations requiring extensive repairs shall be replaced and shall meet the <PRTPAGE P="180"/>applicable specifications and requirements of Subchapter IA.</P>
              <P>(c) The OCMI has discretion to accept alternatives or equivalents which meet the established standards, and to give special consideration to departures from the regulations when it can be shown that special circumstances warrant such departures.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Plan Submittal.</E> (a) For units not classed by the American Bureau of Shipping or other recognized classification society, (see 46 CFR 108.109) the OCMI must have sufficient plans and information submitted to him which will describe such things as the unit's size, construction, configuration, arrangement of tanks, decks and spaces; and the machinery and electrical installation. In addition, the OCMI may require submittal of any additional data he considers necessary in order to proceed with the original inspections.</P>
              <P>(b) For units classed by the American Bureau of Shipping or other recognized classification society, the plans and information described in Subchapter IA § 107.305 (a), (b), (v), and (ii) and a general description of the machinery and electrical installation shall be submitted to the OCMI for information. The OCMI may accept continued classification as proof of structural, mechanical, and electrical sufficiency. However, the OCMI may require additional plans and information if necessary.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Hull Structure.</E> (a) No structural changes will be required unless manifestly unsafe conditions exist.</P>
              <P>(b) Existing uncertificated units must be drydocked or have a special examination in lieu of drydocking as required by 46 CFR, 107-261.</P>
              <P>(c) Achievement of one compartment subdivision is not required where extensive modification of the original design would be necessary; however, watertight integrity of the hull and structural boundaries must be maintained. Bulkheads and decks designed to be watertight must be maintained as such where they are penetrated by pipes, electrical cable, reach rods, ventilation systems, etc.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Stability.</E> (a) The stability of each existing unit will be reviewed by the Coast Guard. The plans indicated in 46 CFR Subchapter IA § 107.305(q) through (u-l) must be submitted to the cognizant OCMI or Merchant Marine Technical Office.</P>
              <P>(b) Lightship data from a Coast Guard witnessed and approved stability test is required for each existing, uncertificated unit. Alternatively other evidence of lightship values will be considered on a case by case basis.</P>
              <P>(c) In general, compliance with the intact stability standards of 46 CFR Subchapter IA, §§ 108.303 through 108.309 is required. Where existing units were designed to a lesser standard of stability than that specified in §§ 108.303 through 108.309, some relaxation based on proven past performance may be granted at the discretion of the OCMI and limiting conditions, if any, set forth in the operating manual. In no case will the minimum wind speed for adequate stability be reduced below 50 knots.</P>
              <P>(d) An operating manual shall be prepared for each unit. Each operating manual must contain the information indicated in 46 CFR Subchapter IA, § 109.121(d) and be submitted to the cognizant OCMI or Merchant Marine Technical Office for review.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Load Line.</E> (a) All units are required to obtain and maintain a valid Load Line Certificate. The structure and stability of the unit must be proven adequate for the voyages and areas of operation intended.</P>
              <P>(b) The American Bureau of Shipping or other recognized classification society will issue Load Line Certificates and conduct initial and annual load line surveys. Coast Guard and the American Bureau of Shipping inspections may be conducted simultaneously, but it is the owner's responsibility to arrange coordinated inspection schedules.</P>
              <P>(c) The structural review conducted by the American Bureau of Shipping or other recognized classification society for load line assignment may be accepted by the Coast Guard as proof of structural adequacy of the hull.</P>
              <P>(d) The stability review must be completed prior to issuance of a Load Line Certificate. The Coast Guard will inform the American Bureau of Shipping or other recognized classification society of the results of the stability review, and will indicate any stability limitations to be placed on the Load Line Certificate.</P>
              <P>(e) Freeboard calculations for self-elevating units with barge type hulls will be made in accordance with 46 CFR, Part 42. The bow height requirements of 46 CFR 42.20-70 may be relaxed to approximately 33% of the normal requirement for barge shapes moving at speeds less than 6 knots. No relaxation of the addition to freeboard for deficiency in sheer is allowed. The freeboard for units other than self-elevating units with barge type hulls will be based upon compliance with the intact and damage stability standards applicable at the time the unit was contracted for.</P>
              <P>(f) All units <E T="03">delivered after the date of this NVIC</E> regardless of contract date, must obtain a Load Line Certificate as soon as operationally feasible.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Route and Operating Area Limitations.</E> (a) Units classed by the American Bureau of Shipping or other recognized classification society for ocean service generally will be certificated by the Coast Guard for ocean routes.</P>

              <P>(b) Unclassed units which have proven structural and stability adequacy by continued safe operation in a specific geographic area, such as the Gulf of Mexico, will be limited by the Certificate of Inspection and <PRTPAGE P="181"/>Load Line Certificate to that area. To qualify for an unlimited oceans route, such a unit must be reviewed for adequacy of the structure and stability by the Coast Guard and meet the Load Line requirements of d. (5) above.</P>
              <P>(c) Any unit which intends to move or operate outside the geographical area indicated on the Certificate of Inspection must receive prior approval from the OCMI.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Fire Protection.</E> (a) <E T="03">Structural fire protection.</E> All units must meet the provisions of § 108.123, Insulation of Combustible Materials and § 108.127, Storage Lockers for Combustibles. All existing interior stairways which are open at each end must be enclosed at one level. On units where wood was utilized in the construction of accommodation spaces, each space must be equipped with a smoke or heat detector either battery powered or operating on the AC power supply. All detectors must have the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., label (UL) or the Factory Mutual Laboratories (FM) label.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Fire Extinguishing Systems.</E> Systems and equipment must be provided which will meet or be equivalent to the applicable specifications and provisions required by Subchapter IA. Installed fire extinguishing systems, which provide equivalent or greater protection than systems required by Subpart E, Subchapter IA may be continued in use as long as they are in good material condition and will function as designed. Where practicable, existing washdown systems may be utilized as the firemain. Where wood was utilized in the construction of accommodation spaces, the applicable requirements of 46 CFR Subchapter IA, Table 108.495(a) should be doubled.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Lifesaving Equipment.</E> (a) Each unit must have lifesaving equipment (lifeboats and davit launched liferafts) for 200 percent of the total persons allowed on board. Except for submersible type units, the installation of lifeboats for 100 percent of the persons (on board) is required in accordance with 46 CFR 108.503 of Subchapter IA. Consideration will be given to those units where existing arrangement and structure do not provide sufficient room for installation of the lifeboats or where the added weight of the lifeboats, davits and winches will materially reduce the variable load capacity of the unit. In such cases, davit launched inflatable liferafts with a combined personnel capacity of the required lifeboats, and a rescue boat approved by the OCMI may be acceptable equivalents. Submersible type units may substitute Coast Guard approved throw over type inflatable liferafts and an approved rescue boat for the required lifeboats.</P>
              <P>(b) For the second part of the total 200 percent primary lifesaving requirement, lifeboats installed in accordance with 33 CFR, Subchapter “N” Part 144 or Coast Guard approved life floats may be retained as provided for in 3.d(1)(b) of this Circular. They will be considered collectively with the Coast Guard approved liferafts for calculating the amount of equipment to provide for 100 percent of personnel on board.</P>
              <P>(c) Adequate access to all lifesaving equipment must be provided.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Cranes.</E> (a) Plan approval will not normally be required of any crane which conforms to the specifications of the manufacturer as originally installed. A rated load test as described in § 107.260 of Subchapter IA will be required unless the crane has been load tested while under certification by an approved certifying authority as provided for in 46 CFR 107.258. Prior to the rated load test, the crane should be identified by manufacturer and model number to determine that the correct load rating chart is being used. The owner must submit to the OCMI details and calculations of any alterations to a crane which were accomplished without manufacturer's documentation in order to verify the rated load of the crane.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Electrical.</E> (a) Multiple power sources do not require an emergency generator; however, storage batteries or approved relay-controlled battery operated lanterns are required to be installed for the emergency lighting system and provide 12 hours of lighting.</P>
              <P>(b) Electrical equipment installed in Class I, division 1 and 2 locations, as defined in Subchapter IA, § 108.170 must be of a suitable type and in good material condition.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Unfired Pressure Vessels.</E> (a) Unfired pressure vessels built and stamped in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code may be continued in service as long as they remain in satisfactory condition. At the original and subsequent inspections for certification, ASME Code pressure vessels must be tested and examined in accordance with the requirements in 46 CFR 61.10-5.</P>
              <P>(b) Unfired pressure vessels which cannot be identified as being constructed to any recognized standard may be continued in service provided that no obvious defects are noted. These pressure vessels shall be hydrostatically tested to one and one half times the working pressure. For pressure vessels that can not be reasonably hydrostatically tested, nondestructive testing may be used to verify the pressure vessels condition for continued serviceability. These pressure vessels will then be stamped with a Coast Guard identification number and periodically tested and examined in accordance with the requirements in 46 CFR 61.10-5.</P>
              <P>(12) <E T="03">Marine Sanitation Devices.</E> (a) All units must meet the provisions of 33 CFR Part 159, Coast Guard Marine Sanitation Devices Regulations. The discharge requirements are compatible with the OCS Orders of the U.S. Geological Survey.<PRTPAGE P="182"/>
              </P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Action.</E> a. The owner of each <E T="03">existing certificated</E> unit must provide the cognizant OCMI a proposed plan to accomplish the requirements in paragraph 3. c. of this NVIC within 60 days from the effective date of the regulations. Most items should be approved at the unit's next inspection for certification; however, where major equipment installations are concerned, the owner may be allowed up to two years to comply with the requirements from the time the OCMI completes his assessment of the proposals.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Application for Original Inspection for Certification.</E> Not later than sixty days from January 3, 1979, application for original inspection for certification of all <E T="03">existing uncertificated units,</E> shall be submitted to the appropriate OCMI. The plans or descriptive data specified in paragraph 3.d(2) of this NVIC along with a proposed plan to bring the unit into compliance should, if possible, be submitted with the application for inspection. If not feasible to assemble all required information in this time frame, an estimated date of submittal shall be indicated on the application. Arrangements should be made to commence the original inspection for certification with due consideration for the unit's operating situation.</P>
              <P>c. To the extent possible the same inspection team will conduct the inspection of all existing uncertificated units in a geographical area. It may be advantageous to conduct the original inspection in conjunction with an impending special or periodic survey, drydocking or availability period. Units under construction will receive primary consideration by the OCMI for the allocation of time and personnel so that any problems can be identified while the unit is in the most advantageous situation to apply corrections.</P>
              <P>d. The variety of designs and arrangements presented by existing uninspected MODU's makes it impractical to prescribe detailed standards for all existing units. The procedures followed to implement this NVC must provide the necessary flexibility. Items which must be taken into consideration in applying this NVIC are listed below. Categorizing units into groups to which the same items apply will be of value during the inspection process. These items are:</P>
              <P>• Type</P>
              <P>• Builder</P>
              <P>• Model</P>
              <P>• Date build</P>
              <P>• Classed by ABS or other classification society</P>
              <P>• Load Line assignment</P>
              <P>• Operating history (including geographical areas)</P>
              <P>• Present location</P>
              <P>e. <E T="03">Issuance of the Original Certificate of Inspection.</E> The intent of the original inspection of <E T="03">existing uncertificated units</E> is to identify and commence correction of any unsafe conditions and/or equipment deficiencies and to issue the unit an original Certificate of Inspection. A reasonable period of time will be permitted to correct minor deficiencies. Those items directly affecting personnel safety and health will require immediate attention to correct the unsafe condition. Extensive deficiencies, such as those involving structural aspects or equipment may require up to two years to remedy. Additional times may be allowed if repair facilities are not available to coastal areas adjacent to the unit's area of operation. Where manifestly unsafe conditions are found, the OCMI may require that the unit discontinue operations until such conditions are corrected. If the owner or operator feels aggrieved by the decision of the OCMI, the appeals procedures of 46 CFR 2.01-70 are applicable.</P>
              <P>f. Questions concerning this NVIC should be referred to the Commandant (CG-CVC).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Protection of conductors.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of overcurrent protection for conductors is to open the electric circuit if the current reaches a value that will cause an excessive or dangerous temperature in the conductor or conductor insulation. A grounded conductor is protected from overcurrent if a protective device of a suitable rating or setting is in each ungrounded conductor of the same circuit.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Overcurrent protection of conductors.</E> Each conductor must be protected in accordance with its current carrying capacity, except a conductor for the following circuits which must meet the following listed subparts of this chapter:</P>
              <P>(1) Propulsion circuits, Subpart 111.35.</P>
              <P>(2) Steering circuits, subchapter F of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) Motor circuits, Subpart 111.70.</P>
              <P>(4) Flexible cord and fixture wire for lighting circuits, Subpart 111.75.</P>
              <P>(5) Switchboard circuits, Subpart 111.30.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fuses and circuitbreakers.</E> If the allowable current-carrying capacity of the conductor does not correspond to a standard rating for fuses or circuitbreakers that meets Section 240.6 of NFPA NEC 2002 or IEC 60092-202 (both incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 110.10-1), then the next larger such rating is acceptable, except that:</P>
              <P>(1) This rating must not be larger than 150 percent of the current-carrying capacity of the conductor; and</P>
              <P>(2) The effect of temperature on the operation of fuses and thermally controlled circuitbreakers must be taken into consideration.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Parallel overcurrent protective devices.</E> An overcurrent protective device must not be connected in parallel with another overcurrent protective device.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Thermal devices.</E> No thermal cutout, thermal relay, or other device not designed to open a short circuit may be used for protection of a conductor against overcurrent due to a short circuit or ground, except in a motor circuit as described in Article 430 of NFPA NEC 2002 or in IEC 60092-202.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Ungrounded conductors.</E> A fuse or overcurrent trip unit of a circuit breaker must be in each ungrounded conductor. A branch switch or circuit breaker must open all conductors of the circuit, except grounded conductors.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Grounded conductor.</E> An overcurrent device must not be in a permanently grounded conductor, except:</P>
              <P>(1) An overcurrent device that simultaneously opens all conductors of the circuit, unless prohibited by § 111.05-17 for the bus-tie feeder connecting the emergency and main switchboards; and</P>
              <P>(2) For motor-running protection described in Article 430 of NFPA NEC 2002 or in IEC 60092-202.</P>

              <P>(b) No load may be powered from an emergency power source, except:</P>
              <P>(1) A load required by this part to be powered from the emergency power source;</P>
              <P>(2) A bus-tie to the main switchboard that meets § 112.05-3; and</P>
              <P>(3) Emergency loads that may be necessary to maintain or restore the propulsion plant, such as control systems, controllable pitch propellers, hydraulic pumps, control air compressors, and machinery necessary for dead-ship start-up.</P>
              <P>(c) Other loads may be authorized by the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center (MSC), to be connected to the emergency source of power to provide an increased level of safety in recognition of a unique vessel mission or configuration. When these loads are authorized, the emergency power source must—</P>
              <P>(1) Be sized to supply these loads using a unity (1.0) service factor; or</P>
              <P>(2) Be provided with automatic load shedding that removes these loads and operates before the emergency generator trips due to overload. The automatic load shedding circuit breakers must be manually reset.</P>
              <P>(d) The regulations in this part have preemptive effect over State or local regulations in the same field.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(b) Except as noted in § 115.114 of this part, each vessel inspected and certificated under the provisions of this subchapter must, when any passengers are aboard during the tenure of the certificate, be in full compliance with the terms of the certificate.</P>
              <P>(c) If necessary to prevent delay of the vessel, a temporary Certificate of Inspection may be issued pending the issuance and delivery of the regular Certificate of Inspection. The temporary certificate must be carried in the same manner as the regular certificate and is considered the same as the regular Certificate of Inspection which it represents.</P>
              <P>(d) A vessel on a foreign voyage between a port in the United States and a port in a foreign country, whose Certificate of Inspection expires during the voyage, may lawfully complete the voyage without a valid Certificate of Inspection provided the voyage is completed within 30 days of expiration and the certificate did not expire within 15 days of sailing on the foreign voyage from a U.S. port.</P>

              <P>(a) A Certificate of Inspection is obtained or renewed by making application on Form CG 3752, “Application for Inspection of U.S. Vessel,” to the Coast Guard OCMI of the marine inspection zone in which the inspection is to be made. Form CG-3752 may be obtained at any U.S. Coast Guard Sector Office or Marine Inspection Office.</P>
              <P>(b) The application for initial inspection of a vessel being newly constructed or converted must be submitted prior to the start of the construction or conversion.</P>
              <P>(c) The construction, arrangement, and equipment of each vessel must be acceptable to the cognizant OCMI as a prerequisite of the issuance of the initial Certificate of Inspection.

              <P>(a) The area of operation for each vessel and any necessary operational limits are determined by the cognizant OCMI, and recorded on the vessel's Certificate of Inspection. Each area of operation, referred to as a route, is described on the Certificate of Inspection under the major headings “Oceans,” <PRTPAGE P="285"/>“Coastwise,” “Limited Coastwise,” “Great Lakes,” “Lakes, Bays, and Sounds,” or “Rivers,” as applicable. Further limitations imposed or extensions granted are described by reference to bodies of waters, geographical points, distance from geographical points, distances from land, depths of channel, seasonal limitations, and similar factors.</P>
              <P>(b) Operation of a vessel on a route of lesser severity than those specifically described or designated on the Certificate of Inspection is permitted unless expressly prohibited on the certificate of Inspection. The general order of severity of routes is: oceans, coastwise, limited coastwise, Great Lakes, lakes, bays and sounds, and rivers. The cognizant OCMI may prohibit a vessel from operating on a route of lesser severity than the primary route a vessel is authorized to operate on if local conditions necessitate such a restriction.</P>
              <P>(c) Non-self-propelled vessels are prohibited from operating on an oceans, coastwise, limited coastwise, or Great Lakes route unless the Commandant approves such a route.</P>
              <P>(d) When designating a permitted route or imposing any operational limits on a vessel, the OCMI may consider:</P>
              <P>(1) Requirements of this subchapter for which compliance is based on the route of the vessel;</P>
              <P>(2) The performance capabilities of the vessel based on design, scantlings, stability, subdivision, propulsion, speed, operating modes, maneuverability, and other characteristics;</P>
              <P>(3) The suitability of the vessel for night-time operations; and</P>
              <P>(4) The suitability of the vessel for use in all environmental conditions.</P>

              <P>(a) The maximum number of passengers permitted must be not more than that allowed by the requirements of this section, except as authorized by the OCMI under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The maximum number of passengers permitted on any vessel may be the greatest number permitted by the length of rail criterion, deck area criterion, or fixed seating criterion described in this paragraph or a combination of these criteria as allowed by paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Length of rail criterion.</E> One passenger may be permitted for each 760 millimeters (30 inches) of rail space available to the passengers at the periphery of each deck. The following rail space may not be used in determining the maximum number of passengers permitted:</P>
              <P>(i) Rail space in congested areas unsafe for passengers, such as near anchor handling equipment or line handling gear, in the way of sail booms, running rigging, or paddle wheels, or along pulpits;</P>

              <P>(iii) Rail space where persons standing in the space would block the line of vision of the credentialed individual operating the vessel.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Deck area criterion.</E> One passenger may be permitted for each 0.9 square meters (10 square feet) of deck area available for the passengers' use. In computing such deck area, the areas occupied by the following must be excluded:</P>
              <P>(i) Areas for which the number of persons permitted is determined using the fixed seating criteria;</P>
              <P>(ii) Obstructions, including stairway and elevator enclosures, elevated stages, bars, and cashier stands, but not including slot machines, tables, or other room furnishings;</P>

              <P>(v) Spaces below deck that are unsuitable for passengers or that would not normally be used by passengers;</P>
              <P>(vi) Interior passageways less than 840 millimeters (34 inches) wide and passageways on open deck, less than 710 millimeters (28 inches) wide;</P>
              <P>(vii) Bow pulpits, swimming platforms and areas that do not have a solid deck, such as netting on multi-hull vessels;</P>
              <P>(viii) Deck areas in way of paddle wheels; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Aisle area provided in accordance with § 116.820(d) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Fixed seating criterion.</E> One passenger may be permitted for each 455 millimeter (18 inches) of width of fixed seating provided by § 116.820 of this chapter. Each sleeping berth in overnight accommodation spaces shall be counted as only one seat.</P>
              <P>(c) Different passenger capacity criteria may be used on each deck of a vessel and added together to determine the total passenger capacity of that vessel. Where seats are provided on part of a deck and not on another, the number of passengers permitted on a vessel may be the sum of the number permitted by the seating criterion for the space having seats and the number permitted by the deck area criterion for the space having no seats. The length of rail criterion may not be combined with either the deck area criterion or the fixed seating criterion when determining the maximum number of passengers permitted on an individual deck.</P>
              <P>(d) For a vessel operating on short runs on protected waters such as a ferry, the cognizant OCMI may give special consideration to increases in passenger allowances.</P>

              <P>(b) If your vessel is operated on international voyages subject to SOLAS requirements, it must undergo a drydock examination once every 12 months unless it has been approved to undergo an underwater survey (UWILD) per § 115.615 of this part. If the vessel becomes due for a drydock examination or an internal structural examination during the voyage, it may lawfully complete the voyage prior to the examination if it undergoes the required examination upon completion of the voyage to the United States but not later than 30 days after the examination is due. If the vessel is due for an examination within 15 days of sailing on an international voyage from a United States port, it must undergo the required examination before sailing.</P>
              <P>(c) If your vessel is operated on other than international voyages and does not meet the conditions in paragraph (d) of this section, it must undergo a drydock and internal structural examination as follows unless it has been approved to undergo an underwater survey (UWILD) per § 115.615 of this part:</P>
              <P>(1) A vessel that is exposed to salt water more than three months in any 12 month period since the last examination must undergo a drydock examination and an internal structural examination at least once every two years; and</P>
              <P>(2) A vessel that is exposed to salt water not more than three months in any 12 month period since the last examination must undergo a drydock examination and an internal structural examination at least once every five years.</P>
              <P>(d) Whenever damage or deterioration to hull plating or structural members that may affect the seaworthiness of a vessel is discovered or suspected, the cognizant OCMI may conduct an internal structural examination in any affected space, including fuel tanks, and may require the vessel to be drydocked or taken out of service to assess the extent of the damage, and to effect permanent repairs. The OCMI may also decrease the drydock examination intervals to monitor the vessel's structural condition.</P>
              <P>(e) For a vessel that is eligible per § 115.625 of this part and the owner opts for an alternate hull examination with the underwater survey portion conducted exclusively by divers, the vessel must undergo two alternate hull exams and two internal structural exams within any five-year period. If a vessel completes a satisfactory alternate hull exam, with the underwater survey portion conducted predominantly by an approved underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the vessel must undergo one alternate hull and one internal structural exam, within any five-year period. The vessel may undergo a drydock exam to satisfy any of the required alternate hull exams.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Description of the Alternative Hull Examination (AHE) Program for certain passenger vessels.</SUBJECT>

              <P>The Alternative Hull Examination (AHE) Program provides you with an alternative to a drydock examination by allowing your vessel's hull to be examined while it remains afloat. If completed using only divers, this program has four steps: the application process, the preliminary examination, the pre-survey meeting, and the hull examination. If the vessel is already participating in the program or if a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) is used during the program, the preliminary exam step may be omitted. Once you complete these steps, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI), will evaluate the results and accept the examination as a credit hull exam if the vessel is in satisfactory condition. If only divers are used for the underwater survey portion of the examination process, you may receive credit for a period of time such that subsequent AHEs would be conducted at intervals of twice in every five years, with no more than three years between any two AHEs. The OCMI may waive an underwater survey in accordance with § 115.655(d) provided that the interval does not exceed five years between any two underwater surveys. If an underwater ROV is used as the predominate method to examine the vessel's underwater hull plating, you may receive credit up to five years. At the end of this period, you may apply for further participation under the AHE Program.

              <P>(a) To continue to participate in the AHE Program, vessel operators must conduct an annual hull condition assessment. At a minimum, vessel operators must conduct an internal examination and take random hull gaugings internally during the hull condition assessment, unless waived by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI). If the annual hull assessment reveals significant damage or corrosion, where temporary repairs have been made, or where other critical areas of concern have been identified, the OCMI may require an expanded examination to include an underwater hull examination using divers. If an underwater examination is required, the examination must focus on areas at higher risk of damage or corrosion and must include a representative sampling of hull gaugings.</P>
              <P>(b) If an underwater survey is required for the annual hull condition assessment, the OCMI may require the presence of a third party examiner and a written hull examination report must be submitted to the OCMI. This report must include thickness gauging results, a copy of the audio and video recordings and any other information that will help the OCMI evaluate your vessel for continued participation in the AHE program. The third party examiner must sign the report and confirm the validity of its contents.</P>
              <P>(c) You must submit your preventive maintenance reports or checklists on an annual basis to the OCMI. These reports or checklists must conform to the plans you submitted in your application under § 115.630 of this part, which the OCMI approved.</P>
              <P>(d) Prior to each scheduled annual hull condition assessment—</P>
              <P>(1) The owner may submit to the OCMI a plan for conducting the assessment, or a request for a waiver of this requirement, no fewer than 30 days before the scheduled assessment; and</P>
              <P>(2) The OCMI may reduce the scope or extend the interval of the assessment if the operational, casualty, and deficiency history of the vessel, along with a recommendation of the vessel's master, indicates that it is warranted.</P>

              <P>(i) Stairways, ladders, elevators, stringers, treads, platforms, and landings protected from potential fire exposure by being in either exterior locations or within protective enclosure bulkheads, decks and doors as described in the requirements of paragraph (j), may be constructed of approved incombustible material; and</P>
              <P>(ii) All stairways, ladders, elevators, stringers, treads, platforms, and landings subject to potential fire exposure and not within a protective enclosure must be composed of steel unless their failure will not hinder fire fighter access or debarkation.</P>
              <P>(c) A stairway or stairtower must be fitted with handrails on both sides at a vertical height above the tread at its nosing of between 840 and 910 millimeters (33 and 36 inches). A stairway or stairtower of more than 1,680 millimeters (66 inches) in width must also be fitted with a center handrail.</P>
              <P>(d) A handrail fitted in a stairtower, stairway, landing, ladder, or elevator must be constructed of noncombustible material.</P>
              <P>(e) A stairway or stairtower must be clear of all obstructions other than handrails.</P>
              <P>(f) Curved, spiral, or winding stairways are permitted only with the specific approval of the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(g) Differences in the depth of tread or height of riser of stairs in different flights of stairs in a stairway or stairtower must be minimized. In an individual flight of stairs in a stairway or stairtower, the depth of the tread and the height of riser shall not have a variance exceeding 5 millimeters (0.19685 inches).</P>
              <P>(h) In a stairway or stairtower, the sum of the riser height and tread depth must be at least 432 millimeters (17 inches) and not more than 455 millimeters (18 inches). A stairway or stairtower having treads less than 254 millimeters (10 inches) in depth must have a nosing of 12.7 millimeters (0.5 inches) in width.</P>

              <P>(j) A stairway or stairtower must not have an angle of inclination from the horizontal of more than 40 degrees. However, stairways accessing spaces visited solely by crew members must not have an angle of inclination from the horizontal of more than 50 degrees. The Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center may approve higher angles of inclination for spaces with severe space constraints.</P>
              <P>(k) Where a continuous vertical deck penetration for a stairway or elevator exceeds one deck, the integrity of all decks must be assured by enclosure bulkheads and decks meeting the requirements of §§ 116.415(b) and 116.415(c) of this part. Doors meeting the requirements of §§ 116.435(b) and 116.435(c) of this part must be fitted in the enclosure at each deck serviced.</P>
              <P>(l) Where a vertical deck penetration for a stairway or elevator involves only one deck, the integrity of the deck must be assured as required by paragraph (k) of this section. Alternatively the integrity of the deck may be maintained at one level only by means of bulkheads of the same fire control boundary rating as the deck penetrated. A door meeting the requirements of §§ 116.435(b) and 116.435(c) of this part must be fitted in the enclosure. In spaces containing a balcony, the integrity of the balcony deck in the way of stairways or elevators need not be assured. However, such stairways must not be considered to be a means of escape.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Arrangements.</E> (1) Each main vertical zone with more than two deck levels, each having enclosed or partially enclosed accommodation spaces, other than washroom or toilet spaces and open decks, must be served by at least one stairtower, so that a person may escape from any accommodation space or any other space where persons may be normally quartered or employed, to all other decks having any such spaces within the same main vertical zone, without coming out of the stairtower enclosure. Where a <PRTPAGE P="315"/>stairtower is accessible from two main vertical zones, it may be considered as the required stairtower for both main vertical zones provided all boundaries of the stairtower meet main vertical zone boundary requirements contained in § 116.415 of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Each stairtower must give access to an embarkation station or an area of refuge identified in the emergency escape plan required by § 116.520.</P>
              <P>(3) Stairtowers must not give direct access to overnight accommodations or spaces of type 9, 10, 11, or 12.</P>
              <P>(4) A stairtower is not required to extend below deck to serve spaces in which a fire is likely to originate if one of the means of escape is:</P>
              <P>(i) A stairway that leads directly to a weather deck; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A stairway leading to a stairtower enclosure that includes self closing fire doors at both the top and bottom; or</P>
              <P>(iii) An alternative stairtower arrangement providing an equivalent level of safety is acceptable to the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center.</P>
              <P>(5) The Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center may accept other means of escape in combination with a stairtower provided the exits open directly to weather or through a main vertical zone bulkhead.</P>
              <P>(6) For vessels in which a stairtower is not required, a stairway must provide a means of escape for each deck of the main vertical zone.</P>
              <P>(n) The minimum tread width of a stairway or stairtower must be 8.4 millimeters (0.333 inches) for each person served, but must not be less than 910 millimeters (36 inches). However, in stairways accessing spaces utilized solely by crew members, the minimum tread width must be 8.4 millimeters (0.333 inches) for each person served, but not less than 710 millimeters (28 inches).</P>
              <P>(1) The minimum tread width of a stairway or stairtower must be determined for each deck considering only those persons on that deck, except as provided in paragraph (n)(3) of this section. Once a minimum tread width has been established at any deck, it must not be decreased in the direction of escape.</P>
              <P>(2) In determining the number of persons served, a space must be considered to contain at least the number of persons as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Passenger overnight accommodation spaces: Designed capacity;</P>
              <P>(ii) Accommodation spaces having fixed seating for passengers: Maximum seating capacity;</P>
              <P>(iii) Public spaces, including spaces such as casinos, restaurants, club rooms, and cinemas, and public accommodation spaces as defined in § 114.400 of this subchapter, except overnight accommodation spaces: One person for each 0.9 square meters (10 square feet) of deck area. In computing such deck area, the following areas must be excluded:</P>
              <P>(A) Areas for which the number of persons permitted is determined using the fixed seating criterion;</P>
              <P>(B) Obstructions, including stairway and elevator enclosures, elevated stages, bars, and cashier stands, but not including slot machines, tables, or other room furnishings;</P>
              <P>(C) Toilets and washrooms;</P>
              <P>(D) Interior passageways less than 850 millimeters (34 inches) wide and passageways on open deck less than 710 millimeters (28 inches) wide;</P>
              <P>(E) Spaces necessary for handling lifesaving equipment, anchor handling equipment, or line handling gear, or in way of sail booms or running rigging; and</P>
              <P>(F) Bow pulpits, swimming platforms, and areas that do not have a solid deck, such as netting on multi hull vessels;</P>
              <P>(iv) Crew overnight accommodation spaces: Two-thirds designed capacity; and</P>
              <P>(v) Work spaces: Occupancy under normal operating conditions.</P>

              <P>(3) If a stairway forms part of a normal embarkation or debarkation route, or egress route to an area of refuge, the number of persons using the stairway for that purpose must be used in determining the minimum tread width. The Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center, may approve a narrower stairway width if a narrower stairway will not unreasonably impede the flow of persons out of the space requiring egress or from an area of refuge to an <PRTPAGE P="316"/>embarkation station. Specific consideration can be given by the Marine Safety Center to the arrangement of landing area in excess of that required by paragraph (i) of this section when considering the approval of a narrower stairway width. However, the stairway width must be at least 910 millimeters (36 inches) unless the stairway is utilized solely by crew members, in which case the minimum tread width must be at least 710 millimeters (28 inches).</P>
              <P>(4) If more than one stairtower serves a main vertical zone, the number of persons in that main vertical zone may be distributed among the stairtowers.</P>

              <P>(a) Each survival craft required on a vessel by this part must meet one of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) For an inflatable liferaft—Approved under approval series 160.151 or other standard specified by the Commandant, with the applicable equipment pack, as determined by the cognizant OCMI. Each inflatable liferaft required on a vessel by this part must have a capacity of 6 persons or more. Inflatable liferafts may be substituted for inflatable buoyant apparatus or life floats required under this section.</P>

              <P>(2) For a life float—Approved under approval series 160.027 or other standard specified by the Commandant. Buoyant apparatus may be used to meet requirements for life floats if the buoyant apparatus was installed on <PRTPAGE P="330"/>board the vessel on or before March 11, 1996, and if the buoyant apparatus remains in good and serviceable condition.</P>
              <P>(3) For an inflatable buoyant apparatus—Approved under approval series 160.010 or other standard specified by the Commandant. Inflatable buoyant apparatus may be substituted for life floats required under this section.</P>
              <P>(4) For a buoyant apparatus—Approved under approval series 160.010 or other standard specified by the Commandant. An existing buoyant apparatus may not be used to satisfy the requirements for life floats on existing vessels wishing to upgrade the total number of passengers carried on an oceans route.</P>
              <P>(b) If the vessel carries a small boat or boats, the capacity of these boats may be counted toward the life float capacity required by this subpart. Such boats must meet the requirements for safe loading and flotation in 33 CFR Part 183, and must meet the stowage, launching and equipment requirements in this part for the survival craft they replace.</P>
              <P>(c) A summary of survival craft requirements is provided in Table 117.200(c).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Alternative annual inspection for offshore supply vessels less than 400 gross tons in foreign ports.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The owner, master or operator of an OSV of less than 400 gross tons may request authorization to conduct an alternative annual inspection in place of the annual inspection described in § 126.510(a) of this subpart. The request must go to the cognizant OCMI assigned responsibility for inspections in the country in which the vessel is operating and will be examined. To qualify for the alternative annual examination, the vessel must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The request must be in writing and be received by the OCMI not later than the anniversary date.</P>
              <P>(2) The vessel is likely to be continuously employed outside of the United States during the 3 months before and after each anniversary date.</P>
              <P>(b) In determining whether to authorize the alternative annual inspection, the OCMI considers the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Information contained in previous examination reports on inspection and drydock, including the recommendation of the then cognizant OCMI for participation in the alternative midperiod program and alternative annual examination.</P>
              <P>(2) The nature, number, and severity of marine casualties or accidents, as defined in § 4.03-1 of this chapter, involving the vessel in the 3 years preceding the request.</P>
              <P>(3) The nature, number, and gravity of any outstanding inspection requirements for the vessel.</P>

              <P>(4) The owner's or operator's history of compliance and cooperation in such <PRTPAGE P="399"/>alternative midperiod examinations and annual inspections, including:</P>
              <P>(i) The prompt correction of deficiencies.</P>
              <P>(ii) The reliability of previously submitted reports on such alternative midperiod examinations and annual inspections.</P>
              <P>(iii) The reliability of representations that the vessel would be, and was, employed outside of the United States during the 3 months before and after each anniversary date.</P>
              <P>(c) This OCMI provides the applicant with written authorization, if any, to proceed with the alternative annual inspection, including, when appropriate, special instructions.</P>
              <P>(d) The following conditions must be met for the alternative annual inspection to be accepted instead of the annual inspection required by § 126.510 of this subpart:</P>
              <P>(1) The alternative annual inspection must occur within the 3 months before or after each anniversary date.</P>
              <P>(2) The alternative annual inspection must be of the scope detailed by § 126.510(a) of this subchapter and must be conducted by the master, owner or operator of the vessel, or by a designated representative of the owner or operator.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon completion of the alternative annual inspection, the person or persons making the examination must prepare a comprehensive report describing the conditions found. This report must contain sufficient detail to let the OCMI determine whether the vessel is fit for the service and route specified on the Certificate of Inspection. This report must include all reports and receipts documenting the servicing of lifesaving equipment and any photographs or sketches necessary to clarify unusual circumstances. Each person preparing this report must sign it and certify that the information contained therein is complete and accurate.</P>
              <P>(4) Unless the master of the vessel participated in the alternative annual inspection and the preparation of the comprehensive report, the master will review the report for completeness and accuracy. The master must sign the report to indicate his or her review and validation and must forward it to the owner or operator of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(5) The owner or operator of a vessel examined under this section must review and submit the comprehensive report, required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section, to the OCMI. The report must reach the OCMI before the first day of the fifth month following the anniversary date. The forwarding letter or endorsement must be certified to be true and must contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) That the person or persons who made the alternative annual inspection acted on behalf of the vessel's owner or operator.</P>
              <P>(ii) That the report was reviewed by the owner or operator.</P>
              <P>(iii) That the discrepancies noted during the reinspection have been corrected, or will be within a stated time.</P>
              <P>(iv) That the owner or operator has sufficient personal knowledge of conditions aboard the vessel at the time of the reinspection, or has conducted inquires necessary to justify forming a belief that the report is complete and accurate.</P>

              <P>(e) The form of certification required under this section, for the alternative annual inspection, is as follows:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>I certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief the information contained in the report is complete and accurate.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              

              <P>(f) Deficiencies and hazards discovered during the alternative annual inspection conducted pursuant to this section must be corrected or eliminated, if practical, before the examination report is submitted to the OCMI in accordance with paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Deficiencies and hazards that are not corrected or eliminated by the time the examination report is submitted must be listed in the report as “outstanding.” Upon receipt of an examination report indicating outstanding deficiencies or hazards, the OCMI must inform the owner or operator in writing of the time period within which to correct or eliminate the deficiencies or hazards and the method for establishing that the corrections have been accomplished. Where a deficiency or hazard remains uncorrected or uneliminated after the expiration of the time specified for correction or <PRTPAGE P="400"/>elimination, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection must initiate appropriate enforcement measures.</P>
              <P>(g) Upon receipt of the report, the OCMI will evaluate it and determine the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Whether the cognizant OCMI accepts the alternative annual inspection instead of the annual inspection required by § 126.510(a) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) Whether the vessel is in satisfactory condition.</P>
              <P>(3) Whether the vessel continues to be reasonably fit for its intended service and route.</P>
              <P>(h) The OCMI may require further information necessary for the determinations required by this section. The OCMI will inform the owner or operator in writing of these determinations.</P>
              <P>(i) If the OCMI, in compliance with paragraph (g) of this section, does not accept the alternative annual inspection instead of the annual inspection required by § 126.510(a) of this subpart, he or she will require reinspection of the vessel as soon as practicable. He or she will inform the vessel owner or operator in writing that the alternative examination is not acceptable and that a reinspection is necessary. The owner, master, or operator must make the vessel available for the reinspection at a time and place agreeable to this OCMI.</P>
              <P>(j) If the OCMI determines, in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, that the alternative annual inspection is accepted in lieu of the annual inspection required by § 126.510(a) of this subpart, the master must complete the applicable COI endorsement.</P>

              <P>(d) When a skeg or other appendage extends below the line of the keel, the draft at the end of the vessel adjacent to that appendage must be measured to a line tangent to the lowest part of the appendage and parallel to the line of the bottom of the keel.</P>
              <P>(e) Drafts must be separated so that the projections of the marks onto a vertical plane are of uniform height, equal to the vertical spacing between consecutive marks.</P>
              <P>(f) Marks must be painted in a color contrasting with that of the hull.</P>
              <P>(g) Where marks are obscured because of operational constraints or by protrusions, the vessel must be fitted with a reliable draft-indicating system from which the drafts at bow and stern can be determined.</P>

              <P>(f) Each fall, where exposed to damage or fouling, must have guards or equivalent protection. Each fall that leads along a deck must be covered with a guard that is not more than 300 millimeters (1 foot) above the deck.</P>
              <P>(g) The lowering speed for a fully loaded survival craft must be not less than that obtained from the following formula:</P>
              <P>(1) S = 0.4 + (0.02 H), where S is the speed of lowering in meters per second, and H is the height in meters from the davit head to the waterline at the lightest seagoing condition.</P>
              <P>(2) S = 79 + (1.2 H), where S is the speed of lowering in feet per minute, and H is the height in feet.</P>
              <P>(h) The lowering speed for a survival craft loaded with all of its equipment must be not less than 70 percent of the speed required under paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The lowering speed for a fully loaded survival craft must be not more than 1.3 meters per second (256 feet per minute).</P>
              <P>(j) If a survival craft is recovered by electric power, the electrical installation, including the electric power-operated boat winch, must meet the requirements in part 129 of this chapter. If a survival craft is recovered by any means of power, including a portable power source, safety devices must be provided which automatically cut off the power before the davit arms or falls reach the stops in order to avoid overstressing the falls or davits, unless the motor is designed to prevent such overstressing.</P>
              <P>(k) Each launching appliance must be fitted with brakes that meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The brakes must be capable of stopping the descent of the survival craft or rescue boat and holding it securely when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment.</P>
              <P>(2) The brake pads must, where necessary, be protected from water and oil.</P>
              <P>(3) Manual brakes must be arranged so that the brake is always applied unless the operator, or a mechanism activated by the operator, holds the brake control in the off position.</P>

              <P>(a) Each davit for a rescue boat must be approved under approval series 160.132 with a winch approved under approval series 160.115. If the launching arrangement uses a single fall, the davit may be of a type which is turned out manually, and the release mechanism may be an automatic disengaging apparatus approved under approval series 160.170 instead of a lifeboat release mechanism. Each rescue boat must be <PRTPAGE P="460"/>able to be boarded and launched directly from the stowed position with the number of persons assigned to crew the rescue boat on board. If the rescue boat is also a lifeboat and the other lifeboats are boarded and launched from an embarkation deck, the arrangements must be such that the rescue boat can also be boarded and launched from the embarkation deck.</P>
              <P>(b) Each rescue boat must be capable of being launched with the OSV making headway of 5 knots in calm water. A painter may be used to meet this requirement.</P>
              <P>(c) Each rescue boat embarkation and launching arrangement must permit the rescue boat to be boarded and launched in the shortest possible time.</P>
              <P>(d) Rapid recovery of the rescue boat must be possible when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment.</P>
              <P>(e) Each rescue boat launching appliance must be fitted with a powered winch motor.</P>
              <P>(f) Each rescue boat launching appliance must be capable of hoisting the rescue boat when loaded with its full rescue boat complement of persons and equipment at a rate of not less than 0.3 meters per second (59 feet per minute).</P>

              <P>(a) A towing vessel must obtain approval to engage in an excursion prior to carrying a greater number of persons than permitted by the COI, or to temporarily extend or alter its area of operation.</P>
              <P>(b) For a vessel utilizing the TSMS option, the vessel may engage in an excursion, if:</P>
              <P>(1) In the opinion of the owner, managing operator, or master the operation can be undertaken safely;</P>
              <P>(2) The TSMS addresses the temporary excursion operation contemplated; the necessary conditions under which the vessel may safely conduct the operation, including the number of persons the vessel may carry; the crew required; and any additional lifesaving or safety equipment required;</P>
              <P>(3) The vessel proceeds as provided in the TSMS; and</P>
              <P>(4) The owner, managing operator, or master notifies the cognizant OCMI at least 48 hours prior to the temporary excursion operation. The cognizant OCMI may require submission of pertinent provisions of the TSMS applicable to the vessel for review and onboard verification of compliance. If the cognizant OCMI has reasonable cause to believe that the TSMS applicable to the vessel is insufficient for the intended excursion, additional information may be requested and/or additional requirements may be imposed.</P>
              <P>(c) If the towing vessel is not under a TSMS, or the TSMS applicable to the vessel does not address the temporary excursion operation:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or managing operator must submit an application to the cognizant OCMI. The application must state the intended route, number of passengers or guests, and any other conditions applicable to the excursion that exceed those specified in its COI.</P>
              <P>(2) The cognizant OCMI may issue the permit either on Form CG-949, “Permit To Carry Excursion Party,” or in letter form. The cognizant OCMI will indicate on the permit the conditions under which it is issued, the number of persons the vessel may carry, the crew required, any additional lifesaving or safety equipment required, the route for which the permit is granted, and the dates on which the permit is valid. The application may be made electronically, in writing, or orally.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Documenting compliance for the Coast Guard inspection option.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A towing vessel subject to this subchapter and choosing the Coast Guard inspection option, or required to have the Coast Guard inspection option, must undergo an annual inspection within 3 months before or after the COI anniversary date.</P>
              <P>(a) Owners and managing operators must contact the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) to schedule an inspection at a time and place the OCMI approves. No written application is required.</P>
              <P>(b) Annual inspections will be similar to the inspection for certification but will cover less detail unless the marine inspector finds deficiencies or determines that a major change has occurred since the last inspection. If the marine inspector finds deficiencies or finds that a major change to the vessel has occurred, he or she will conduct a more detailed inspection to ensure that the vessel is in satisfactory condition and fit for the service for which it is intended. If the vessel passes the annual inspection, the Coast Guard will endorse the vessel's current Certificate of Inspection (COI).</P>

              <P>(c) If the annual inspection reveals the need, the owner or managing operator must make any or all repairs or <PRTPAGE P="479"/>improvements within the time period specified by the OCMI. The OCMI may use Form CG-835, “Notice of Merchant Marine Inspection Requirements,” to record deficiencies discovered during the inspection. The OCMI will then give a copy of the completed form to the master of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(d) Nothing in this subpart limits the marine inspector from conducting any tests or inspections he or she deems necessary to be assured of the vessel's seaworthiness or fitness for its route and service.</P>
