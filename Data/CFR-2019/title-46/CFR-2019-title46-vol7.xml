      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2017), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>The rules and regulations in this part are prescribed and apply to public nautical school ships, except vessels of the Navy or Coast Guard. It is the intent of the regulations in this part to provide minimum standards for vessels used as nautical school ships in accordance with the various inspection statutes and to obtain their correct and uniform application. This part is not applicable to civilian nautical school ships.</P>

              <P>(a) Regulations in this part contain requirements for the design, construction, inspection, lifesaving equipment, <PRTPAGE P="8"/>firefighting and fire prevention requirements, special operating requirements and number of persons allowed to be carried on nautical school ships. The regulations in this subchapter have preemptive effect over State or local regulations in the same field.</P>
              <P>(b) Vessels owned or chartered by the United States Maritime Administration that may be used by or in connection with any nautical school are not normally considered as merchant vessels of the United States and, therefore, are not documented.</P>
              <P>(c) Documented nautical school ships of 500 gross tons or more, on international voyages, shall comply with the standards of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, for cargo vessels.</P>

              <P>(a) One of the criteria used for invocation of safety standards is the descriptions of school ships by relative sizes in gross tonnages. When it is determined in accordance with § 70.05-20 of this chapter that a particular school ship has a Bureau of Customs' assigned gross register tonnage which is not indicative of the relative physical size of the vessel, the requirements in this part and the manning shall be that applicable to a vessel of the greater relative size.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> (1) Nautical school ships shall be provided with an inert-gas fire-extinguishing system when required.</P>

              <P>(2) All nautical school ships carrying combustible cargo in the holds, between decks, or other closed cargo compartments shall be equipped with means for extinguishing fire in such compartments by the use of any inert-gas fire-extinguishing system approved by the Coast Guard or Navy. However, in specific cases where by reason of the design, such compartments are normally accessible and considered to be part of the working or living quarters, <PRTPAGE P="18"/>a water sprinkling system may be installed in lieu of an inert-gas fire-extinguishing system. On such vessels contracted for prior to January 1, 1962, a steam smothering system may be accepted in lieu of the inert gas system for the protection of cargo holds, paint lockers, and similar spaces. However, although existing steam smothering systems may be repaired, replaced, or extended, no new systems contracted for on or after January 1, 1962, will be permitted.</P>
              <P>(3) Cabinets, boxes, or casings enclosing manifolds or valves must be marked in conspicuous red letters at least 2 inches high: “[STEAM/CARBON DIOXIDE/HALON/CLEAN AGENT—as appropriate] FIRE APPARATUS.”.</P>
              <P>(4) Steam or gas piping fitted for extinguishing fire shall not be used for any other purpose except that it may be used for fire-detecting purposes.</P>
              <P>(5) Pipes for conveying steam from the boilers for the purpose of extinguishing fire shall not be led into the cabins, other living spaces, or working spaces. Pipes for conveying carbon dioxide or other extinguishing vapors for the purpose of extinguishing fire shall not be led into the cabins or other living spaces.</P>
              <P>(6) Steam smothering lines shall be tested with at least 50 pounds air pressure with ends of the smothering lines capped, or by blowing steam through the lines, and a survey made for detecting corrosion and defects, using the hammer test or such other means as may be necessary.</P>
              <P>(7) At annual inspections, each carbon dioxide cylinder, whether fixed or portable, each Halon 1301 cylinder, and each clean agent cylinder must be examined externally and replaced if excessive corrosion is found; and:</P>
              <P>(i) Each carbon dioxide cylinder must be weighed and recharged if its weight loss exceeds 10 percent of the charge;</P>
              <P>(ii) Each Halon 1301 and halocarbon cylinder must be weighed and checked, and recharged or replaced if weight loss exceeds 5 percent of required weight of charge or if cylinder pressure loss exceeds 10 percent of specified gauge pressure, adjusted for temperature; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Each inert gas cylinder must be checked and recharged or replaced if cylinder pressure loss exceeds 5 percent of specified gauge pressure adjusted for temperature.</P>
              <P>(8) Carbon dioxide, Halon 1301, and clean agent cylinders carried on board nautical school ships must be tested and marked in accordance with the requirements of 46 CFR 147.60, 147.65, 147.66, and 147.67.</P>
              <P>(9) On all systems test time delays, alarms, and ventilation shutdowns with carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or other nonflammable gas as stated in the system manufacturer's instruction manual. Inspect hoses for damage or decay. Ensure that nozzles are unobstructed.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Steam systems.</E> (1) As noted in subparagraph (a)(2) of this section, steam smothering systems are not permitted on nautical school ships contracted for on or after January 1, 1962, nor for new installations on vessels contracted for prior to that date. Where steam smothering systems are installed, the provisions of this paragraph shall be met.</P>
              <P>(2) Steam for fire-extinguishing systems shall be available at a suitable pressure from the main boilers or a donkey or auxiliary boiler.</P>
              <P>(3) The pipe lines shall be led from not more than three stations in easily accessible locations on the weather deck to each cargo hold, cargo 'tween-decks, or other closed cargo compartments, and to each cargo-oil deep tank, lamp locker, oil room, and like compartments, which lamp locker, oil room, and like compartments, shall be wholly and tightly lined with metal. The steam connections to the lamp lockers, oil rooms, and like compartments may be taken from the nearest steam supply line, independent of the extinguishing manifolds. In lamp lockers, oil rooms, and like compartments, adequate means may be provided for ventilation if suitable dampers capable of being operated from outside the spaces are fitted in each vent duct.</P>
              <P>(4) Each pipe in the extinguishing manifolds shall be fitted with a shut-off valve plainly and permanently marked to indicate into which compartment it discharges. This requirement also applies to independent extinguishing lines.</P>

              <P>(5) Manifold steam supply pipes shall be fitted with master valves at the manifolds, and provision shall be made <PRTPAGE P="19"/>for draining the manifold and individual lines to protect them against freezing. If the manifolds are located on an open deck, they shall be enclosed in a metal box.</P>
              <P>(6) The minimum diameter of any steam fire-extinguishing pipe to a cargo hold, cargo 'tween-decks, other closed cargo compartments, or cargo-oil deep tank shall be one inch, the size and number of pipes to be governed by the size of the compartment. The minimum diameter of any steam fire-extinguishing pipe to a lamp locker, oil room, or like compartments, shall be three-fourths of an inch.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Inert-gas systems.</E> (1) When a carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>) smothering system is fitted in the cargo hold, cargo 'tween-decks, or other closed cargo compartments, or cargo-oil deep tanks, the quantity of carbon dioxide shall be sufficient to give a gas saturation of 30 percent of the gross volume of the largest cargo hold. The quantity in pounds of carbon dioxide required may be determined approximately by the following formula:</P>

              <P>(2) When a carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>) smothering system is fitted in the lamp locker, oil room, or like compartments, the quantity in pounds of carbon dioxide required may be determined by dividing the gross volume of the space by a factor of 22. Lamp lockers, oil rooms, and like compartments, in all classes of vessels, shall be wholly and tightly lined with metal. The whole charge of gas shall be capable of being released simultaneously by operating one valve and control, and all cylinders shall be completely discharged in not more than two minutes.</P>
              <P>(3) Pipes used for supplying carbon dioxide to the cargo holds, cargo 'tween-decks, other closed cargo compartments, and cargo-oil deep tanks shall be not less than three-fourths inch inside diameter. Pipes used for supplying carbon dioxide to lamp lockers, oil rooms, and like compartments shall not be less than one-half inch inside diameter.</P>
              <P>(4) The control(s) releasing the inert gas shall be located in a position(s) outside the space(s) protected and shall be readily accessible when the vessel is being navigated. All valves shall be permanently marked to indicate into which compartment they discharge. A space which is protected by a carbon dioxide extinguishing system, and is normally accessible to crew while the nautical school ship is being navigated shall be fitted with an approved audible alarm in such space, which will be automatically sounded when the carbon dioxide is admitted to the space.</P>
              <P>(5) Provisions shall be made to prevent the admission of air into the lower parts of cargo holds, cargo 'tween-decks, and other closed cargo compartments while the inert-gas system is in operation.</P>
              <P>(6) Cylinders, piping, and controls for the inert-gas system shall be protected from damage and shall be securely fastened and supported.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Each lifeboat, inflatable liferaft, and lifefloat must be stowed so that—</P>
                <P>(1) It is capable of being launched within 10 minutes or, in the case of vessels having one compartment subdivision, 30 minutes;</P>
                <P>(2) It does not impede the launching or handling of other lifesaving appliances;</P>
                <P>(3) It does not impede the marshaling of persons at the embarkation stations, or their embarkation; and</P>
                <P>(4) It is capable of being put in the water safely and rapidly even under unfavorable conditions of list and trim.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Lifeboat stowage.</E> Each lifeboat must be stowed to meet the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(1) Each lifeboat must be attached to a separate set of davits.</P>
                <P>(2) Lifeboats must not be stowed in the bow of the vessel nor so far aft as to be endangered by the propellers or overhang of the stern.</P>
                <P>(3) Lifeboats must be stowed so that it is not necessary to lift them in order to swing out the davits.</P>
                <P>(4) Means must be provided for bringing the lifeboats against the ship's side and holding them there so that persons may safely embark, unless the lifeboats are arranged for boarding at the stowage position.</P>
                <P>(5) Lifeboats must be fitted with skates or other suitable means to facilitate launching against an adverse list of up to 15 degrees. However, skates may be dispensed with if, in the opinion of the Commandant, the arrangements ensure that the lifeboats can be satisfactorily launched without them.</P>
                <P>(6) Means must be provided outside the machinery space to prevent the discharge of water into the lifeboats while they are being lowered.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Inflatable liferaft stowage.</E> Inflatable liferafts must be stowed so that they will float free in the event of the vessel sinking. Stowage and launching arrangements must be to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Life float stowage.</E> Each life float must be stowed to meet the requirements of this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(1) Each life float must be secured to the vessel by a painter and a float-free link that is—</P>
                <P>(i) Certified to meet subpart 160.073 of this chapter;</P>
                <P>(ii) Of proper strength for the size of the life float as indicated on its identification tag; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Secured to the painter at one end and secured to the vessel on the other end.</P>
                <P>(2) The means by which the float-free link is attached to the vessel must—</P>
                <P>(i) Have a breaking strength of at least the breaking strength of the painter.</P>
                <P>(ii) If synthetic, be of a dark color or of a material certified to be resistant to deterioration from ultraviolet light; and</P>
                <P>(iii) If metal, be corrosion resistant.</P>
                <P>(3) If the life float does not have a painter attachment fitting, a means for attaching the painter must be provided by a wire or line that—</P>
                <P>(i) Encircles the body of the device;</P>
                <P>(ii) Will not slip off;</P>
                <P>(iii) Has a breaking strength that is at least the breaking strength of the painter; and</P>
                <P>(iv) If synthetic, is of a dark color or is of a material certified to be resistant to deterioration from ultraviolet light.</P>
                <P>(4) The float-free link described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section is not required if the vessel operates solely in waters that have a depth less than the length of the painter.</P>
                <P>(5) If the vessel carries more than one life float, the life floats may be grouped and each group secured by a single painter, provided that—</P>
                <P>(i) The combined weight of each group of life floats does not exceed 400 pounds;</P>
                <P>(ii) Each life float is individually attached to the painter by a line that meets paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section and which is long enough so that each can float without contacting any other life float in the group; and</P>

                <P>(iii) The strength of the float-free link and the strength of the painter under paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) of <PRTPAGE P="54"/>this section is determined by the combined capacity of the group of life floats.</P>
                <P>(6) Each life float, as stowed, must be capable of easy launching. Life floats weighing over 400 pounds must not require lifting before launching.</P>
                <P>(7) Life floats must be secured to the vessel only by a painter and lashings that can be easily released or by hydraulic releases. They must not be stowed in more than four tiers. When stowed in tiers, the separate units must be kept apart by spacers.</P>
                <P>(8) There must be means to prevent shifting.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Hydraulic Releases.</E> Each hydraulic release used in the installation of any inflatable liferaft or life float must meet subpart 160.062 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) All calculations required by this subchapter must be submitted with the plans required by § 170.075 of this subpart. Calculations must account for the weight of all loads carried aboard the vessel.</P>
              <P>(b) If it is necessary to compute and plot any of the following curves as part of the calculations required in this subchapter, these plots must also be submitted:</P>
              <P>(1) Righting arm or moment curves.</P>
              <P>(2) Heeling arm or moment curves.</P>
              <P>(3) Cross curves of stability.</P>
              <P>(4) Floodable length curves.</P>
              <P>(c) The assumed weight per person for calculations showing compliance with the regulations of this subchapter must be representative of the passengers and crew aboard the vessel while engaged in the service intended. Unless the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) permits or requires the use of other values in writing, the assumed weight per person of passengers and crew must not be less than that the Assumed Average Weight per Person (AAWPP) calculated in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) The AAWPP is 185 lb from December 1, 2011 until the AAWPP is first updated pursuant to the provisions of this section. As of the effective date of the first AAWPP update after December 1, 2011, this paragraph (d)(1) will be superseded and cease to be effective.</P>
              <P>(2) The formula in paragraph (e) of this section will be used to determine an update to the AAWPP. It requires the use of data in the most recent report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), or any successors to those centers. This report can be found on the CDC's Web site.</P>

              <P>(3) Each time the CDC releases a report containing mean weights of United States adult males and females, the Coast Guard will apply the formula in paragraph (e) of this section to that data. The resulting value will become the new AAWPP only if the sum equals or exceeds 10 pounds more than the AAWPP then in effect. The Coast Guard will notify the public of the new AAWPP in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and other appropriate media.</P>
              <P>(4) Updates to the AAWPP used in calculations showing compliance with this subchapter will be promulgated as interpretive rules and become effective in accordance with the provisions of this section without further rulemaking procedures.</P>
              <P>(5) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Coast Guard may choose, in its discretion, to conduct further rulemaking procedures at any time to amend this subchapter, including updates of the AAWPP.</P>

              <P>(6) Updates to the AAWPP used in calculations showing compliance with this subchapter will be published in a separate <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice and <PRTPAGE P="92"/>other appropriate media, except when the Coast Guard conducts further rulemaking procedures under paragraph (d)(5) of this section.</P>

              <P>(7) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Coast Guard may choose, in its discretion, to delay or dispense with any update of the AAWPP. In the event the Coast Guard elects to dispense with or delay an update that would otherwise issue as an interpretive rule pursuant to the provisions of this section, the Coast Guard will inform the public of the decision and explain the reasons in a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice.</P>
              <P>(e) To obtain an AAWPP update, add the mean weight of all U.S. males aged 20 years and older to the mean weight of all U.S. females aged 20 years and older, and divide the sum by 2. To this average of the mean weights, add 7.5 pounds of assumed clothing weight, and round the resulting sum to the nearest whole number in pounds.</P>

              <P>(f) Updates to the AAWPP will become effective beginning one calendar year after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of a notice described in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(6) of this section, except the initial AAWPP issued pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section will become effective on December 1, 2011. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, the Coast Guard may implement updates to the AAWPP at any time with less than one year of public notice when required for public safety reasons.</P>
              <P>(g) The most recent <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice that publishes the AAWPP as determined by this section is also on file at the Coast Guard Headquarters.

              <P>(1) Before a sliding watertight door assembly is installed in a vessel, the bulkhead in the vicinity of the door opening must be stiffened. Such bulkhead stiffeners, or deck reinforcement where flush deck door openings are desired, must not be less than 6 inches nor more than 12 inches from the door frame so that an unstiffened diaphragm of bulkhead plating 6 to 12 inches wide is provided completely around the door frame. Where such limits cannot be maintained, alternative installations will be considered by the Marine Safety Center. In determining the scantlings of these bulkhead stiffeners, the door frame should not be considered as contributing to the strength of the bulkhead. Provision must also be made to adequately support the thrust bearings and other equipment that may be mounted on the bulkhead or deck.</P>

              <P>(i) If bolted, a suitable thin heat and fire resistant gasket or suitable compound must be used between the bulkhead and the frame for watertightness. The bulkhead plating must be worked to a plane surface in way of the frame when mounting.</P>
              <P>(ii) If welded, caution must be exercised in the welding process so that the door frame is not distorted.</P>
              <P>(e) For each watertight door which is in a required subdivision bulkhead, an indicator light must be installed in the pilothouse and at each other vessel operating station from which the door is not visible. The indicator must show whether the door is open or closed.</P>

              <P>(2) When doing calculations required to demonstrate that compartments on opposite sides of a main transverse watertight bulkhead that bounds the machinery space comply with § 171.065(c), the mean of the uniform average permeabilities determined from Table 171.066 for the two compartments must be used.</P>
              <P>(b) If an average permeability can be calculated that is less than that given by the formulas in Table 171.066, the lesser value may be substituted if approved by the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center. When determining this lesser value, the following permeabilities must be used:</P>
              <P>(1) 95% for passenger, crew, and all other spaces that, in the full load condition, normally contain no cargo, stores, provisions, or mail.</P>
              <P>(2) 60% for cargo, stores, provisions, or mail spaces.</P>
              <P>(3) 85% for spaces containing machinery.</P>
              <P>(4) Values approved by the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center for double bottoms, oil fuel, and other tanks.</P>
              <P>(c) In the case of unusual arrangements, the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center may require a detailed calculation of average permeability for the portions of the vessel forward or aft of the machinery spaces. When doing these calculations, the permeabilities specified in paragraph (b) of this section must be used.</P>
              <P>(d) When calculating permeability, the total volume of the ‘tween deck spaces between two adjacent main transverse watertight bulkheads that contains any passenger or crew space must be regarded as passenger space volume, except that the volume of any space that is completely enclosed in steel bulkheads and is not a crew or passenger space may be excluded.</P>

              <P>A tankship is presumed to survive assumed damage if it meets the following conditions in the final stage of flooding:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Final waterline.</E> The final waterline, in the final condition of sinkage, <PRTPAGE P="147"/>heel, and trim, must be below the lower edge of openings such as air pipes and openings closed by weathertight doors or hatch covers. The following types of openings may be submerged when the tankship is at the final waterline:</P>
              <P>(1) Openings covered by watertight manhole covers or watertight flush scuttles.</P>
              <P>(2) Small watertight cargo tank hatch covers.</P>
              <P>(3) A Class 1 door in a watertight bulkhead within the superstructure.</P>
              <P>(4) Remotely operated sliding watertight doors.</P>
              <P>(5) Side scuttles of the non-opening type.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Heel angle.</E> (1) Except as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the maximum angle of heel must not exceed 15 degrees (17 degrees if no part of the freeboard deck is immersed).</P>
              <P>(2) The Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center will consider on a case by case basis each vessel 492 feet (150 meters) or less in length having a final heel angle greater than 17 degrees but less than 25 degrees.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Range of stability.</E> Through an angle of 20 degrees beyond its position of equilibrium after flooding, a tankship must meet the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The righting arm curve must be positive.</P>
              <P>(2) The maximum righting arm must be at least 3.95 inches (10 cm).</P>
              <P>(3) Each submerged opening must be weathertight.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Progressive flooding.</E> Pipes, ducts or tunnels within the assumed extent of damage must be either—</P>
              <P>(1) Equipped with arrangements such as stop check valves to prevent progressive flooding to other spaces with which they connect; or</P>
              <P>(2) Assumed in the design calculations required by § 172.130 to flood the spaces with which they connect.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Buoyancy of superstructure.</E> The buoyancy of any superstructure directly above the side damage is to be disregarded. The unflooded parts of superstructures beyond the extent of damage may be taken into consideration if they are separated from the damaged space by watertight bulkheads and no progressive flooding of these intact spaces takes place.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Metacentric height.</E> After flooding, the tankship's metacentric height must be at least 2 inches (50mm) when the ship is in the upright position.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Equalization arrangements.</E> Flooding equalization arrangements requiring mechanical operation such as valves or cross-flooding lines may not be assumed to reduce the angle of heel. Spaces joined by ducts of large cross sectional area are treated as common spaces.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Intermediate stages of flooding.</E> If an intermediate stage of flooding is more critical than the final stage, the tankship must be shown by design calculations to meet the requirements in this section in the intermediate stage.</P>

              <P>(a) Appliances to insure watertight integrity include watertight doors, hatches, scuttles, bolted manhole covers, or other watertight closures for openings in watertight decks and bulkheads.</P>
              <P>(b) Appliances to insure weathertight integrity include weathertight doors and hatches, closures for air pipes, ventilators, ventilation intakes and outlets, and closures for other openings in deckhouses and superstructures.</P>
              <P>(c) Each internal opening equipped with appliances to insure watertight integrity that is used intermittently during operation of the unit while afloat must meet the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Each door, hatch, and scuttle must—</P>

              <P>(i) Be remotely controlled from a normally manned control station, and be operable locally from both sides of the bulkhead; or<PRTPAGE P="169"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) If there is no means of remote control there must be an alarm system that signals whether the appliance is open or closed both locally at each appliance and in a normally manned control station.</P>
              <P>(2) Each closing appliance must remain watertight under the design water pressure of the watertight boundary of which it is a part.</P>
              <P>(d) Each external opening fitted with an appliance to insure weathertight integrity must be located so that it would not be submerged below the final equilibrium waterline if the unit is subjected simultaneously to—</P>
              <P>(1) Damage causing flooding described in §§ 174.075 through 174.085; and</P>
              <P>(2) A wind heeling moment calculated in accordance with § 174.055 using a wind velocity of 50 knots (25.8 meters per second).</P>
              <P>(e) If a unit is equipped with sliding watertight doors, each sliding watertight door must—</P>
              <P>(1) Be designed, constructed, tested, and marked in accordance with ASTM F 1196 (incorporated by reference, see § 174.007);</P>
              <P>(2) Have controls in accordance with ASTM F 1197 (incorporated by reference, see § 174.007), except that a remote manual means of closure, as specified in paragraphs 7.1 and 7.5.1, and a remote mechanical indicator, as specified in paragraph 7.5.2, will not be required; and</P>
              <P>(3) If installed in a subdivision bulkhead, meet Supplemental Requirements Nos. S1 and S3 of ASTM F 1196 (incorporated by reference, see § 174.007), unless the watertight doors are built in accordance with plans previously approved by the Coast Guard, in which case, only Supplemental Requirements Nos. S1 and S3.1.4 of ASTM F 1196 (incorporated by reference, see § 174.007) must be met. In either case, control systems for watertight doors must have power supplies, power sources, installation tests and inspection, and additional remote operating consoles in accordance with Supplemental Requirements Nos. S1 through S4 of ASTM F 1197 (incorporated by reference, see § 174.007).</P>
              <P>(f) Installations of sliding watertight door assemblies must be in accordance with the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Before a sliding watertight door assembly is installed in a vessel, the bulkhead in the vicinity of the door opening must be stiffened. Such bulkhead stiffeners, or deck reinforcement where flush deck door openings are desired, must not be less than 6 inches nor more than 12 inches from the door frame so that an unstiffened diaphragm of bulkhead plating 6 to 12 inches wide is provided completely around the door frame. Where such limits cannot be maintained, alternative installations will be considered by the Marine Safety Center. In determining the scantlings of these bulkhead stiffeners, the door frame should not be considered as contributing to the strength of the bulkhead. Provision must also be made to adequately support the thrust bearings and other equipment that may be mounted on the bulkhead or deck.</P>
              <P>(2) Sliding watertight door frames must be either bolted or welded watertight to the bulkhead.</P>
              <P>(i) If bolted, a suitable thin heat and fire resistant gasket or suitable compound must be used between the bulkhead and the frame for watertightness. The bulkhead plating shall be worked to a plane surface in way of the frame when mounting.</P>
              <P>(ii) If welded, caution must be exercised in the welding process so that the door frame is not distorted.</P>

              <P>(2) For this section, each wind heeling moment must be calculated as prescribed by § 174.055 of this part using winds of 60 knots for normal conditions of operation afloat and of 70 knots for severe-storm conditions of operation afloat.</P>
              <P>(3) For paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the initial metacentric height must be at least 300 millimeters (1 foot) for each leg position encountered while afloat including the full range of leg positions encountered while jacking.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Damaged stability.</E> (1) Each liftboat must be designed so that, while it is in each of its normal operating conditions, its final equilibrium waterline will remain below the lowest edge of any opening through which additional flooding can occur if the liftboat is subjected simultaneously to—</P>
              <P>(i) Damage causing flooding described by paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A wind heeling moment calculated in compliance with § 174.055(b) using a wind speed of 50 knots.</P>

              <P>(3) For compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, no compartment on the liftboat may be ballasted or pumped out to compensate for the flooding described by paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) For compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, each compartment within 760 millimeters (30 inches) of the hull, excluding the bottom of the liftboat, between two adjacent main watertight bulkheads and the uppermost continuous deck or first superstructure deck where superstructures are fitted must be assumed subject to simultaneous flooding.</P>
              <P>(5) In the calculations required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the permeability of a floodable space must be as listed by Table 174.205(d).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">On-bottom stability.</E> Each liftboat must be shown by design calculations to exert a continuous downward force on each footing when the vessel is supported on the bottom with footings and <PRTPAGE P="174"/>is subjected to the forces of waves, currents, and winds of 70 knots under normal conditions of operation, and winds of 100 knots under severe-storm conditions of operation when elevated in a safe place, if this place is other than a harbor of safe refuge. The waves and currents must be appropriate for the winds and place.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Vessels operating under an exemption afforded in the Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 (PVSA).</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 (PVSA) contained an allowance for the exemption of certain passenger vessels that are—</P>
            <P>(1) At least 100 gross tons but less than 300 gross tons; or</P>
            <P>(2) Former public vessels of at least 100 gross tons but less than 500 gross tons.</P>
            <P>(b) The owner or operator of a vessel must have applied for an exemption under PVSA by June 21, 1994, and then brought the vessel into compliance with the interim guidance in Navigation and Inspection Circular (NVIC) 7-94 not later than December 21, 1996. The PVSA exemption is valid for the service life of the vessel, as long as the vessel remains certified for passenger service. If the Certificate of Inspection (COI) is surrendered or otherwise becomes invalid (not including a term while the vessel is out of service but undergoing an inspection for recertification), the owner or operator must meet the appropriate inspection regulations to obtain a new COI without the PVSA exemption.</P>
            <P>(c) Except where the provisions of subchapter H of this chapter apply, the owner or operator must ensure that the vessel meets the requirements of this subchapter, meets any requirements the OCMI deems applicable, and meets any specific additions or exceptions as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) If a vessel does not meet the intact stability requirements of subchapter S of this chapter, the vessel's route(s) will be limited to an area within 20 nautical miles from a harbor of safe refuge, provided the vessel has a history of safe operation on those waters. The OCMI may further restrict the vessel's routes if the vessel's service history, condition, or other factors affect its seaworthiness or safety.</P>
            <P>(2) The vessel may not carry more than 150 passengers, and not more than 49 passengers in overnight accommodations.</P>
            <P>(3) The owner or operator must crew the vessel under the requirements of this subchapter. All officers must be endorsed for the appropriate vessel tonnage. The OCMI may require an appropriately endorsed engineer officer for those vessels of at least 200 gross tons. Vessels carrying more than 50 passengers must have an additional deckhand, and all deckhands on vessels carrying more than 50 passengers must be adequately trained. The crew members on a vessel of at least 200 gross tons, except those operated exclusively on lakes and rivers, are required to hold merchant mariner credentials or merchant mariner documents and 50 percent of the merchant mariner credentials or at least an able seaman.</P>
            <P>(4) The vessel owner or operator must comply with the lifesaving arrangements located in part 180 of this chapter, except that inflatable liferafts are required for primary lifesaving. A rescue boat or suitable rescue arrangement must be provided to the satisfaction of the OCMI.</P>
            <P>(5) The vessel owner or operator must comply with the fire protection requirements located in part 181 of this chapter. When a vessel fails to meet the fire protection and structural fire protection requirements of this subchapter, the vessel owner or operator must meet equivalent requirements to the satisfaction of the cognizant OCMI or submit plans for approval from the Coast Guard Marine Safety Center.</P>

            <P>(6) At a minimum, the owner or operator must outfit the vessel with portable fire extinguishers per 46 CFR 76.50. In addition, the vessel must meet any <PRTPAGE P="179"/>additional requirements of the OCMI, even if they exceed the requirements in 46 CFR 76.50.</P>
            <P>(7) In addition to the means-of-escape requirements of 46 CFR 177.500, the vessel owner or operator must also meet the requirements for means of escape found in 46 CFR 78.47-40.</P>
            <P>(d) The OCMI conducts an inspection and may issue a COI if the vessel meets these requirements. The COI's condition of operation must contain the following endorsement: “This vessel is operating under an exemption afforded in The Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 and as such is limited to domestic voyages and a maximum ___ of passengers and may be subject to additional regulations and restrictions as provided for in Sections 511 and 512 of the Act.”</P>

            <P>(a) The regulations in this subchapter take into account a vessel's length, passenger capacity, construction, equipment, intended service, and operating area. The criterion for application of this subchapter is the gross tonnage of the vessel. When the Commandant determines that the gross tonnage of a particular vessel, which is attained by exemptions, reductions, or other devices in the basic gross tonnage formulation, will circumvent or be incompatible with the application of specific regulations for a vessel of such physical size, the Commandant will prescribe the regulations to be made applicable to the vessel.</P>
            <P>(b) When the Commandant determines that the gross tonnage is not a valid criterion for the use of certain regulations based on the relative size of the vessel, the owner will be informed of the determination and of the regulations applicable to the vessel. The vessel must be brought into compliance with all additional requirements before a Certificate of Inspection is issued.</P>

              <P>(c) If necessary to prevent delay of the vessel, a temporary Certificate of Inspection may be issued pending the issuance and delivery of the regular Certificate of Inspection. The temporary certificate must be carried in the same manner as the regular certificate and is considered the same as the regular Certificate of Inspection that it represents.</P>
              <P>(d) A vessel on a foreign voyage between a port in the United States and a port in a foreign country, whose Certificate of Inspection expires during the voyage, may lawfully complete the voyage without a valid Certificate of Inspection provided the voyage is completed within 30 days of expiration and the certificate did not expire within 15 days of sailing on the foreign voyage from a U.S. port.</P>

              <P>(a) The area of operation for each vessel and any necessary operational limits are determined by the cognizant OCMI, and recorded on the vessel's Certificate of Inspection. Each area of operation, referred to as a route, is described on the Certificate of Inspection under the major headings “Oceans,” “Coastwise,” “Limited Coastwise,” “Great Lakes,” “Lakes, Bays, and Sounds,” or “Rivers,” as applicable. <PRTPAGE P="194"/>Further limitations imposed or extensions granted are described by reference to bodies of waters, geographical points, distance from geographical points, distances from land, depths of channel, seasonal limitations, and similar factors.</P>
              <P>(b) Operation of a vessel on a route of lesser severity than those specifically described or designated on the Certificate of Inspection is permitted unless expressly prohibited on the Certificate of Inspection. The general order of severity of routes is: oceans, coastwise, limited coastwise, Great Lakes, lakes, bays, and sounds, and rivers. The cognizant OCMI may prohibit a vessel from operating on a route of lesser severity than the primary route a vessel is authorized to operate on if local conditions necessitate such a restriction.</P>
              <P>(c) Non-self-propelled vessels are prohibited from operating on an oceans, coastwise, limited coastwise, or Great Lakes route unless the Commandant approves such a route.</P>
              <P>(d) When designating a permitted route or imposing any operational limits on a vessel, the OCMI may consider:</P>
              <P>(1) Requirements of this subchapter for which compliance is based on the route of the vessel;</P>
              <P>(2) The performance capabilities of the vessel based on design, scantlings, stability, subdivision, propulsion, speed, operating modes, maneuverability, and other characteristics;</P>
              <P>(3) The suitability of the vessel for nighttime operations; and</P>

              <P>(b) The maximum number of passengers permitted on any vessel may be the greatest number permitted by the length of rail criterion, deck area criterion, or fixed seating criterion described in this paragraph or a combination of these criteria as allowed by paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Length of rail criterion.</E> One passenger may be permitted for each 760 millimeters (30 inches) of rail space available to the passengers at the periphery of each deck. The following rail space may not be used in determining the maximum number of passengers permitted:</P>
              <P>(i) Rail space in congested areas unsafe for passengers, such as near anchor handling equipment or line handling gear, in the way of sail booms, running rigging, or paddle wheels, or along pulpits;</P>
              <P>(ii) Rail space on stairways; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Rail space where persons standing in the space would block the vision of the individual operating the vessel.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Deck area criterion.</E> One passenger may be permitted for each 0.9 square meters (10 square feet) of deck area available for the passengers' use. In computing such deck area, the areas occupied by the following must be excluded;</P>
              <P>(i) Areas for which the number of persons permitted is determined using the fixed seating criteria;</P>
              <P>(ii) Obstructions, including stairway and elevator enclosures, elevated stages, bars, and cashier stands, but not including slot machines, tables, or other room furnishings;</P>
              <P>(iii) Toilets and washrooms;</P>

              <P>(v) Spaces below deck that are unsuitable for passengers or that would not normally be used by passengers;</P>
              <P>(vi) Interior passageways less than 840 millimeters (34 inches) wide and passageways on open deck, less than 710 millimeters (28 inches) wide;</P>
              <P>(vii) Bow pulpits, swimming platforms and areas that do not have a solid deck, such as netting on multi-hull vessels;</P>
              <P>(viii) Deck areas in way of paddle wheels; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Aisle area provided in accordance with § 177.820(d) in this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Fixed seating criterion.</E> One passenger may be permitted for each 455 millimeter (18 inches) of width of fixed seating provided by § 177.820 of this subchapter. Each sleeping berth in overnight accommodation spaces shall be counted as only one seat.</P>
              <P>(c) Different passenger capacity criteria may be used on each deck of a vessel and added together to determine the total passenger capacity of that vessel. Where seats are provided on part of a deck and not on another, the number of passengers permitted on a vessel may be the sum of the number permitted by the seating criterion for the space having seats and the number permitted by the deck area criterion for the space having no seats. The length of rail criterion may not be combined with either the deck area criterion or the fixed seating criterion when determining the maximum number of passengers permitted on an individual deck.</P>
              <P>(d) For a vessel operating on short runs on protected waters such as a ferry, the cognizant OCMI may give special consideration to increases in passenger allowances.</P>

              <P>(b) If your vessel is operated on international voyages subject to SOLAS requirements, it must undergo a drydock examination once every 12 months unless it has been approved to undergo an underwater survey (UWILD) per § 176.615 of this part. If the vessel becomes due for a drydock examination or an internal structural examination during the voyage, it may lawfully complete the voyage prior to the examination if it undergoes the required examination upon completion of the voyage to the United States but not later than 30 days after the examination was due. If the vessel is due for an examination within 15 days of sailing on an international voyage from the United States port, it must undergo the required examination before sailing.</P>
              <P>(c) If your vessel is not operated on international voyages and does not meet the conditions in paragraph (d) of this section, it must undergo a drydock and internal structural examination as follows unless it has been approved to undergo an underwater survey (UWILD) per § 176.615 of this part:</P>
              <P>(1) A vessel that is exposed to salt water more than three months in any 12 month period since the last examination must undergo a drydock examination and an internal structural at least once every two years; and</P>
              <P>(2) A vessel that is exposed to salt water not more than three months in any 12 month period since the last examination must undergo a drydock examination and an internal structural examination at least once every five years.</P>
              <P>(d) Whenever damage or deterioration to hull plating or structural members that may affect the seaworthiness of a vessel is discovered or suspected, the cognizant OCMI may conduct an internal structural examination in any affected space including fuel tanks, and may require the vessel to be drydocked or taken out of service to assess the extent of the damage, and to effect permanent repairs. The OCMI may also decrease the drydock examination intervals to monitor the vessel's structural condition.</P>
              <P>(e) For a vessel that is eligible per § 115.625, and if the owner opts for an alternate hull examination with the underwater survey portion conducted exclusively by divers, the vessel must undergo two alternate hull exams and two internal structural exams within any five-year period. If a vessel completes a satisfactory alternate hull exam, with the underwater survey portion conducted predominantly by an approved underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the vessel must undergo one alternate hull and one internal structural exam, within any five-year period. The vessel may undergo a drydock exam to satisfy any of the required alternate hull exams.</P>

              <P>(a) A drydock examination conducted in compliance with § 176.600 must be conducted while the vessel is hauled out of the water or placed in a drydock or slipway. During the examination all accessible parts of the vessel's underwater body and all through hull fittings, including the hull plating and planking, appendages, propellers, shafts, bearings, rudders, sea chests, sea valves, and sea strainers shall be made available for examination. Sea chests, sea valves, and sea strainers must be opened for examination. On wooden vessels, fastenings may be required to be pulled for examination. The accuracy of draft or loading marks, if required by § 185.602 of this chapter, must be verified if not verified at a previous drydock examination.</P>
              <P>(b) An internal structural examination conducted in compliance with § 176.600 may be conducted while the vessel is afloat or out of the water and consists of a complete examination of the vessel's main strength members, including the major internal framing, the hull plating and planking, voids, and ballast, cargo, and fuel oil tanks. Where the internal framing, plating, or planking of the vessel is concealed, sections of the lining, ceiling or insulation may be removed or the parts otherwise probed or exposed so that the inspector may be satisfied as to the condition of the hull structure. Fuel oil tanks need not be cleaned out and internally examined if the marine inspector is able to determine by external examination that the general condition of the tanks is satisfactory.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Description of the Alternative Hull Examination (AHE) Program for certain passenger vessels.</SUBJECT>

              <P>The Alternative Hull Examination (AHE) Program provides you with an alternative to a drydock examination by allowing your vessel's hull to be examined while it remains afloat. If completed using only divers, this program has four steps: the application process, the preliminary examination, the pre-survey meeting, and the hull examination. If the vessel is already participating in the program, or if a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) is used during the program, the preliminary exam step may be omitted. Once you complete these steps, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI), will evaluate the results and accept the examination as a credit hull exam if the vessel is in satisfactory condition. If only divers are used for the underwater survey portion of the examination process, you may receive credit for a period of time such that subsequent AHEs would be conducted at intervals of twice in every five years, with no more than three years between any two AHEs. The OCMI may waive an underwater survey in accordance with § 176.655(d) provided that the interval does not exceed five years between any two underwater surveys. If an underwater ROV is used as the predominate method to examine the vessel's underwater hull plating, you may receive credit up to five years. At the end of this period, you may apply for further participation under the AHE Program.

              <P>(a) If you use divers to conduct the underwater survey, you must—</P>
              <P>(1) Locate the vessel so the divers can work safely under the vessel's keel and around both sides. The water velocity must be safe for dive operations;</P>
              <P>(2) Provide permanent hull markings, a temporary grid system of wires or cables spaced not more than 10 feet apart and tagged at one-foot intervals, or any other acoustic or electronic positioning system approved by the OCMI to identify the diver's location with respect to the hull, within one foot of accuracy;</P>
              <P>(3) Take ultrasonic thickness gaugings at a minimum of 5 points on each plate, evenly spaced;</P>
              <P>(4) Take hull plating thickness gaugings along transverse belts at the bow, stern, and midships, as a minimum. Plating thickness gaugings must also be taken along a longitudinal belt at the wind and water strake. Individual gaugings along the transverse and longitudinal belts must be spaced no more than 3 feet apart;</P>
              <P>(5) Ensure the third party examiner observes the entire underwater examination process;</P>
              <P>(6) Record the entire underwater survey with audio and video recording equipment and ensure that communications between divers and the third party examiner are recorded; and</P>
              <P>(7) Use appropriate equipment, such as a clear box, if underwater visibility is poor, to provide the camera with a clear view of the hull.</P>
              <P>(b) You may use an underwater ROV to conduct the underwater survey. The underwater ROV operating team, survey process and equipment, quality assurance methods, and the content and format of the survey report must be accepted by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) prior to the survey. If you choose this option, you must—</P>
              <P>(1) Locate the vessel to ensure that the underwater ROV can operate effectively under the vessel's keel and around both sides; and</P>
              <P>(2) Employ divers to examine any sections of the hull and appurtenances that the underwater ROV cannot access or is otherwise unable to evaluate.</P>
              <P>(3) If the OCMI determines that the data obtained by the ROV, including non-destructive testing results, readability of the results, and positioning standards, will not integrate into the data obtained by the divers, then a third party examiner must be present during the divers portion of the examination.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Hull examination reports.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If you use only divers for the underwater survey portion of the Alternative Hull Examination (AHE), you must provide the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI), with a written hull examination report. This report must include thickness gauging results, bearing clearances, a copy of the audio and video recordings, and any other information that will help the OCMI evaluate your vessel for a credit hull exam. The third party examiner must sign the report and confirm the validity of its contents.</P>
              <P>(b) If you use an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) as the predominate means to examine the vessel's underwater hull plating, you must provide the OCMI with a report in a format that is acceptable to the OCMI, per § 176.650(b) of this part.</P>

              <P>(c) The OCMI will evaluate the hull examination report and grant a credit hull exam if satisfied with the condition of the vessel. If approved and you exclusively use divers to examine the hull plating, you will receive a credit hull exam of up to 36 months. (Underwater examinations are required twice every 5 years.) If approved and you use an underwater ROV as the predominate means to examine the hull plating, you will receive a credit hull exam of up to 60 months (5 years).<PRTPAGE P="204"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) At least 60 days prior to each scheduled underwater exam, the owner may request a waiver from the OCMI if:</P>
              <P>(1) A satisfactory exam has been completed within the last three years;</P>
              <P>(2) The conditions during the last exam allowed at least 80 percent of the bottom surface to be viewed and recorded; and</P>
              <P>(3) The results of the last exam indicated that an extended interval is safe and reasonable.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Continued participation in the Alternative Hull Examination (AHE) Program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To continue to participate in the AHE Program, vessel operators must conduct an annual hull condition assessment. At a minimum, vessel operators must conduct an internal examination and take random hull gaugings internally during the hull condition assessment, unless waived by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI). If the annual hull assessment reveals significant damage or corrosion, where temporary repairs have been made, or where other critical areas of concern have been identified, the OCMI may require an expanded examination to include an underwater hull examination using divers. If an underwater examination is required, the examination must focus on areas at higher risk of damage or corrosion and must include a representative sampling of hull gaugings.</P>
              <P>(b) If an underwater survey is required for the annual hull condition assessment, the OCMI may require the presence of a third party examiner and a written hull examination report must be submitted to the OCMI. This report must include thickness gauging results, a copy of the audio and video recordings and any other information that will help the OCMI evaluate your vessel for continued participation in the AHE program. The third party examiner must sign the report and confirm the validity of its contents.</P>
              <P>(c) You must submit your preventive maintenance reports or checklists on an annual basis to the OCMI. These reports or checklists must conform to the plans you submitted in your application under § 176.630 of this part, which the OCMI approved.</P>
              <P>(d) Prior to each scheduled annual hull condition assessment—</P>
              <P>(1) The owner may submit to the OCMI a plan for conducting the assessment, or a request for a waiver of this requirement, no fewer than 30 days before the scheduled assessment; and</P>
              <P>(2) The OCMI may reduce the scope or extend the interval of the assessment if the operational, casualty, and deficiency history of the vessel, along with a recommendation of the vessel's master, indicates that it is warranted.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, each space accessible to passengers or used by the crew on a regular basis, must have at least two means of escape, one of which must not be a watertight door.</P>
              <P>(b) The two required means of escape must be widely separated and, if possible, at opposite ends or sides of the space to minimize the possibility of one incident blocking both escapes.</P>
              <P>(c) Subject to the restrictions of this section, means of escape may include normal exits and emergency exits, passageways, stairways, ladders, deck scuttles, and windows.</P>
              <P>(d) The number and dimensions of the means of escape from each space must be sufficient for rapid evacuation in an emergency for the number of persons served. In determining the number of persons served, a space must be considered to contain at least the number of persons as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Passenger overnight accommodation spaces: Designed capacity;</P>
              <P>(2) Accommodation spaces having fixed seating for passengers: Maximum seating capacity;</P>
              <P>(3) Public spaces, including spaces such as casinos, restaurants, club rooms, and cinemas, and public accommodation spaces as defined in § 175.400 of this subchapter, except overnight accommodation spaces: One person may be permitted for each 0.9 square meters (10 square feet) of deck area. In computing such deck area, the following areas must be excluded:</P>
              <P>(i) Areas for which the number of persons permitted is determined using the fixed seating criterion;</P>
              <P>(ii) Obstructions, including stairway and elevator enclosures, elevated stages, bars, and cashier stands, but not including slot machines, tables, or other room furnishings;</P>
              <P>(iii) Toilets and washrooms;</P>
              <P>(iv) Interior passageways less than 860 millimeters (34 inches) wide and passageways on open deck less than 710 millimeters (28 inches) wide;</P>
              <P>(v) Spaces necessary for handling lifesaving equipment, anchor handling equipment, or line handling gear, or in way of sail booms or running rigging; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Bow pulpits, swimming platforms, and areas that do not have a solid deck, such as netting on multi hull vessels;</P>
              <P>(4) Crew overnight accommodation spaces: Two-thirds designed capacity; and</P>
              <P>(5) Work spaces: Occupancy under normal operating conditions.</P>
              <P>(e) The dimensions of a means of escape must be such as to allow easy movement of persons when wearing life jackets. There must be no protrusions in means of escape that could cause injury, ensnare clothing, or damage life jackets.</P>
              <P>(f) The minimum clear opening of a door or passageway used as a means of escape must not be less than 810 millimeters (32 inches) in width, however, doors or passageways used solely by crew members must have a clear opening not less than 710 millimeters (28 inches). The sum of the width of all doors and passageways used as means of escape from a space must not be less than 8.4 millimeters (0.333 inches) multiplied by the number of passengers for which the space is designed.</P>

              <P>(g) A dead end passageway, or the equivalent, of more than 6.1 meters (20 feet) in length is prohibited.<PRTPAGE P="218"/>
              </P>
              <P>(h) Each door, hatch, or scuttle, used as a means of escape, must be capable of being opened by one person, from either side, in both light and dark conditions. The method of opening a means of escape must be obvious, rapid, and of adequate strength. Handles and securing devices must be permanently installed and not capable of being easily removed. A door, hatch or scuttle must open towards the expected direction of escape from the space served.</P>
              <P>(i) A means of escape which is not readily apparent to a person from both inside and outside the space must be adequately marked in accordance with § 185.606 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(j) A ladder leading to a deck scuttle may not be used as a means of escape except:</P>
              <P>(1) On a vessel of not more than 19.8 meters (65 feet) in length, a vertical ladder and a deck scuttle may be used as not more than one of the means of escape from passenger accommodation space; or</P>
              <P>(2) As not more than one of the means of escape from any crew accommodation space or work space.</P>
              <P>(k) Each ladder used as a means of escape must be mounted at least 180 millimeters (7 inches) from the nearest permanent object in back of the ladder. Rungs must be:</P>
              <P>(1) At least 405 millimeters (16 inches) in width; and</P>
              <P>(2) Not more than 305 millimeters (12 inches) apart, and uniformly spaced for the length of the ladder with at least 114 millimeters (4.5 inches) clearance above each rung.</P>
              <P>(l) When a deck scuttle serves as a means of escape, it must not be less than 455 millimeters (18 inches) in diameter and must be fitted with a quick acting release and a holdback device to hold the scuttle in an open position.</P>
              <P>(m) Footholds, handholds, ladders, and similar means provided to aid escape, must be suitable for use in emergency conditions, of rigid construction, and permanently fixed in position, unless they can be folded, yet brought into immediate service in an emergency.</P>
              <P>(n) On a vessel of not more than 19.8 meters (65 feet) in length, a window or windshield of sufficient size and proper accessibility may be used as one of the required means of escape from an enclosed space, provided it:</P>
              <P>(1) Does not lead directly overboard;</P>
              <P>(2) Can be opened or is designed to be kicked or pushed out; and</P>
              <P>(3) Is suitably marked.</P>
              <P>(o) Only one means of escape is required from a space where:</P>
              <P>(1) The space has a deck area less than 30 square meters (322 square feet);</P>
              <P>(2) There is no stove, heater, or other source of fire in the space;</P>
              <P>(3) The means of escape is located as far as possible from a machinery space or fuel tank; and</P>
              <P>(4) If an accommodation space, the single means of escape does not include a deck scuttle or a ladder.</P>
              <P>(p) Alternative means of escape from spaces may be provided if acceptable to the cognizant OCMI.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Deck rails.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, rails or equivalent protection must be installed near the periphery of all decks of a vessel accessible to passengers or crew. Equivalent protection may include lifelines, wire rope, chains, and bulwarks, which provide strength and support equivalent to fixed rails. Deck rails must include a top rail with the minimum height required by this section, and lower courses or equivalent protection as required by this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Deck rails must be designed and constructed to withstand a point load of 91 kilograms (200 pounds) applied at any point in any direction, and a uniform load of 74 kilograms per meter (50 pounds per foot) applied to the top rail in any direction. The point and uniform loads do not need to be applied simultaneously.</P>
              <P>(c) Where space limitations make deck rails impractical for areas designed for crew use only, such as at narrow catwalks in way of deckhouse sides, hand grabs may be substituted.</P>
              <P>(d) The height of top rails required by paragraph (a) of this section must be as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Rails on passenger decks of a ferry or a vessel engaged in excursion trips, including but not limited to sightseeing trips, dinner and party cruises, and overnight cruises, must be at least 1,000 millimeters (39.5 inches) high.</P>
              <P>(2) Rails on a vessel subject to the 1966 International Convention on Load Lines must be at least 1,000 millimeters (39.5 inches) high.</P>
              <P>(3) All other rails must be at least 910 millimeters (36 inches) high.</P>
              <P>(4) While engaged in big game angling, the minimum rail height may be reduced to not less than 760 millimeters (30 inches) in way of a person using specialized angling techniques or equipment, such as when using a pedestal mounted fixed fighting chair on a low freeboard vessel, if it can be shown that a higher rail would interfere with the fishing operation and the lower rail would not significantly reduce safety. A rail complying with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this section as applicable must be installed when big game angling is not being conducted.</P>
              <P>(e) Where the principal business of the vessel requires the discharge of persons or cargo in a seaway, such as on pilot boats and dive boats, the cognizant OCMI may accept alternatives to the rails required in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section for those areas of a deck where passengers or cargo are discharged and for which removable rails, lifelines, or chains would hinder discharge operations.</P>

              <P>(f) A sailing vessel, an open boat, or any other vessel not specifically covered elsewhere in this section, must have rails of a minimum height or equivalent protection as considered necessary by the cognizant OCMI, based on the vessel's operation, route, and seating arrangement.<PRTPAGE P="221"/>
              </P>
              <P>(g) Rail courses or the equivalent must be installed between a top rail required by paragraph (a) of this section, and the deck so that no open space exists that is more than 305 millimeters (12 inches) high except:</P>
              <P>(1) On passenger decks of a ferry or of a vessel on an excursion trip the following must be installed:</P>
              <P>(i) Bulwarks;</P>
              <P>(ii) Chain link fencing or wire mesh that has openings of not more than 4 inches in diameter; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Bars, slats, rail courses, or an equivalent spaced at intervals of not more than 100 millimeters (4 inches).</P>
              <P>(2) On a vessel subject to the 1966 International Convention on Load Lines, rail courses, or an equivalent, must be installed so that there is not an open space higher than 230 millimeters (9 inches) from the deck to the first rail course or equivalent.</P>
              <P>(h) Rails must be permanently installed except that the following rails may be removable;</P>
              <P>(1) Rails in way of embarkation stations and boarding locations;</P>
              <P>(2) Rails over 760 millimeters (30 inches) high in way of fishing seats addressed by paragraph (d)(4) of this section; and</P>

              <P>(c) The International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, does not apply to vessels “solely navigating the Great Lakes of North America and the River St. Lawrence as far east as a straight line drawn from Cap de Rosiers to West Point, Anticosti Island and, on the north side of Anticosti Island, the 63d Meridian.” Accordingly, such vessels shall not be considered as being on an “international voyage” for the purpose of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(d) In addition, although voyages between the continental United States and Hawaii or Alaska, and voyages between Hawaii and Alaska are not “international voyages” under the provisions of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, such voyages are similar in nature and shall be considered as “international voyages” for the purposes of this subchapter.</P>

              <P>(a) A Certificate of Inspection is valid for 5 years. Application may be made by the master, owner, or agent for inspection and issuance of a new certificate of inspection at any time during the period of validity of the current certificate.</P>
              <P>(b) Certificates of inspection may be revoked or suspended by the Coast Guard where such process is authorized by law. This may occur if the vessel does not meet the requirements of law or regulations in this chapter or if there is a failure to maintain the safety requirements requisite to the issuance of a certificate of inspection.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) In the case of the following vessels, modification of the period of validity of the certificate of inspection will be permitted as set forth in this paragraph:</P>
              <P>(i) Non-self-propelled vessels of 100 gross tons and over proceeding on the high seas or ocean for the sole purpose of changing place of employment.</P>
              <P>(ii) Non-self-propelled vessels of 100 gross tons and over making rare or infrequent voyages on the high seas or ocean and returning to the port of departure.</P>

              <P>(2) The certificate of inspection may be issued for a specific period of time to cover a described situation or for one voyage only but not to exceed 5 <PRTPAGE P="316"/>years. The certificate of inspection will include the conditions under which the vessel must operate. Unless the vessel is in compliance with this subchapter insofar as it applies to seagoing barges of 100 gross tons and over, such vessel shall not carry any person on board while underway, and the certificate of inspection will be endorsed as an unmanned seagoing barge.</P>

              <P>(c) Design information, when required, will be evaluated against the following minimum design criteria:</P>

              <P>(1) Wet Weight Handling Gear: Wet gear shall be considered to consist of gear used to lower equipment, apparatus or objects beneath the surface of the water or for trailing objects, where the wire rope or cable is payed out beneath the surface and becomes part of the line pull at the head sheave or winch drum. Wet gear shall be designed, as a minimum, to withstand and operate in excess of the breaking strength of the strongest section or wire to be used in any condition of loading. The safety factor for all metal structural parts shall be a minimum of 1.5; <E T="03">i.e.</E>, the yield strength of the material shall be at least 1.5 times the calculated stresses resulting from application of a load equal to the nominal breaking strength of the strongest section or wire rope to be used. Suitable assumptions for the actual loading conditions shall be used in the design of wet gear. The lead of the wire rope from the head sheave or winch drum shall be considered to vary from the vertical and in azimuth in a manner to represent the most adverse loading condition.</P>
              <P>(2) Other weight handling gear will be evaluated on the basis of the standards of a recognized organization or association recognized by the Commandant under § 31.10-6.</P>
              <P>(3) Hydraulic or pneumatic systems will be evaluated on the basis of Subchapter F (Marine Engineering) of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedure for submittal of plans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) As the relative location of shipyards, design offices, and Coast Guard offices vary throughout the country, no specific routing will be required in the submittal of plans. In general, one of the following procedures would apply, but in a particular case, if a more expeditious procedure can be used, there will be no objection to its adoption.</P>
              <P>(1) The plans may be submitted to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, in the district in which the vessel is to be built. This procedure will be most expeditious in the case of those offices where personnel and facilities are available for examination and approval of plans locally.</P>

              <P>(2) The plans may be submitted by visitors directly to the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center, U.S. Coast Guard, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593, or transmitted by mail to: Commanding Officer (MSC), Attn: Marine Safety Center, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7430, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7430, in a written or electronic format. Information for submitting the VSP electronically can be found at <E T="03">http://www.uscg.mil/HQ/MSC.</E> In this case, the plans will be returned directly to the submitter, with a copy of the action being forwarded to the interested Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.</P>
              <P>(3) In the case of classed vessels, upon specific request by the submitter, the American Bureau of Shipping will arrange to forward the necessary plans to the Coast Guard indicating its action thereon. In this case, the plans will be returned as noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) The field of vision from the navigation bridge, whether the vessel is in a laden or unladen condition, must be such that:</P>
              <P>(1) From the conning position, the view of the sea surface is not obscured forward of the bow by more than the lesser of two ship lengths or 500 meters (1640 feet) from dead ahead to 10 degrees on either side of the vessel. Within this arc of visibility any blind sector caused by cargo, cargo gear, or other permanent obstruction must not exceed 5 degrees.</P>
              <P>(2) From the conning position, the horizontal field of vision extends over an arc from at least 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on one side of the vessel, through dead ahead, to at least 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on the other side of the vessel. Blind sectors forward of the beam caused by cargo, cargo gear, or other permanent obstruction must not exceed 10 degrees each, nor total more than 20 degrees, including any blind sector within the arc of visibility described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) From each bridge wing, the field of vision extends over an arc from at least 45 degrees on the opposite bow, through dead ahead, to at least dead astern.<PRTPAGE P="332"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) From the main steering position, the field of vision extends over an arc from dead ahead to at least 60 degrees on either side of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(5) From each bridge wing, the respective side of the vessel is visible forward and aft.</P>
              <P>(b) Windows fitted on the navigation bridge must be arranged so that:</P>
              <P>(1) Framing between windows is kept to a minimum and is not installed immediately in front of any work station.</P>
              <P>(2) Front windows are inclined from the vertical plane, top out, at an angle of not less than 10 degrees and not more than 25 degrees.</P>
              <P>(3) The height of the lower edge of the front windows is limited to prevent any obstruction of the forward view previously described in this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The height of the upper edge of the front windows allows a forward view of the horizon at the conning position, for a person with a height of eye of 1.8 meters (71 inches), when the vessel is at a forward pitch angle of 20 degrees.</P>
              <P>(c) Polarized or tinted windows must not be fitted.</P>

              </GPOTABLE>
              <P>(b) On vessels of 1,000 gross tons or more on an international voyage, each required fire pump, while delivering water through the fire main system at a pressure corresponding to that required by paragraph (c) of this section, must have a minimum capacity of at least two-thirds of that required for an independent bilge pump. However, in no case shall the capacity of each fire pump be less than that otherwise required by this section.</P>
              <P>(c) Each pump must be capable of delivering water simultaneously from the outlets having the greatest pressure drop from the fire pumps to the nozzles which may not always be the two highest outlets, at a Pitot tube pressure of not less than 50 p.s.i. Where 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose is permitted in lieu of 2<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose by footnote 2 of Table 193.10-5(a), the pump capacity must be determined on the same basis as if 2<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose had been permitted. Where <FR>3/4</FR>-inch hose is permitted by Table 193.10-5(a), the Pitot tube pressure may not be less than 35 p.s.i.</P>

              <P>(d) Fire pumps must be fitted on the discharge side with relief valves set to relieve at 25 p.s.i. in excess of the pressure necessary to maintain the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section <PRTPAGE P="343"/>or 125 p.s.i., whichever is greater. Relief valves may be omitted if the pumps, operating under shutoff conditions, are not capable of developing a pressure exceeding this amount.</P>
              <P>(e) Fire pumps must be fitted with a pressure gage on the discharge side of the pumps.</P>
              <P>(f) Fire pumps may be used for other purposes provided at least one of the required pumps is kept available for use on the fire system at all times. In no case may a pump having connection to an oil line be used as a fire pump. Branch lines connected to the fire main for purposes other than fire and deck wash must be so arranged that adequate water can be made continuously available for firefighting purposes.</P>
              <P>(g) The total area of the pipes leading from a pump must not be less than the discharge area of the pump.</P>
              <P>(h) Where two fire pumps are required on vessels with main or auxiliary oil-fired boilers or with internal combustion propulsion machinery, the pumps must be located in separate spaces. The pumps, sea connections, and sources of power must be arranged to ensure that a fire in any one space will not put all of the fire pumps out of operation. However, where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that it is unreasonable or impracticable to meet this requirement, the installation of a fixed fire extinguishing system may be accepted as an alternate method of extinguishing any fire that would affect the powering and operation for the required fire pumps.</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided for in § 193.10-10(e), a sufficient number of hose streams for fire fighting purposes must be immediately available from the fire main at all times by either of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Maintenance of water pressure.</E> (i) Water pressure must be maintained on the fire main at all times by the continuous operation of:</P>
              <P>(A) One of the fire pumps; or</P>
              <P>(B) Another suitable pump capable of supplying one hose stream at a Pitot tube pressure of not less than 50 p.s.i. (35 p.s.i. for <FR>3/4</FR>-inch hose); or,</P>
              <P>(C) A pressure tank capable of supplying one hose stream at a Pitot tube pressure of not less than 50 p.s.i. (35 p.s.i. for <FR>3/4</FR>-inch hose) for five minutes.</P>
              <P>(ii) An audible alarm must be installed to sound in a continuously manned space if the pressure in the fire main drops to less than that necessary to maintain the minimum Pitot tube pressures specified in § 193.10-5(i)(1)(i)(B).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Remote control of fire pumps.</E> (i) At least one fire pump must be capable of remote activation and control.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the fire pump is in a continuously manned machinery space, the controls for operating it and the controls for all necessary valves must be located on the manned operating platform in that space.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the fire pump is in an unmanned machinery space, the controls for its operation and the controls for all necessary valves must be located in:</P>
              <P>(A) The fire control station, if any; or,</P>
              <P>(B) The bridge, if there is no fire control station; or,</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fire hydrants and hose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The size of fire hydrants, hose, and nozzles and the length of hose required must be as noted in Table 193.10-5(a) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) In 2<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose and hydrants specified in Table 193.10-5(a) of this subpart, on vessels of more than 1,500 gross tons, the hydrants in interior locations may have wye connections for 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose. In these cases, the hose must be 75 feet (22.86 meters) in length, and only one hose will be required at each fire station; however, if all such stations can be satisfactorily served with 50-foot lengths, 50-foot hose may be used. The hydrants for exterior locations may substitute two 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch outlets, each with a 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose, supplied through a wye connection.</P>

              <P>(c) On vessels of 500 gross tons or more there must be at least one shore connection to the fire main available to each side of the vessel in an accessible location. Suitable cutout valves and check valves must be provided for <PRTPAGE P="344"/>furnishing the vessel's shore connections with couplings mating those on the shore fire lines. Vessels of 500 gross tons or more on an international voyage, must be provided with at least one international shore connection complying with ASTM F 1121 (incorporated by reference, see § 193.01-3). Facilities must be available enabling an international shore connection to be used on either side of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(d) Fire hydrants must be of sufficient number and so located that any part of the vessel, other than main machinery spaces, may be reached with at least 2 streams of water from separate outlets, at least one of which must be from a single length of hose. In main machinery spaces, all portions of such spaces must be capable of being reached by at least 2 streams of water, each of which must be from a single length of hose from separate outlets; however, this requirement need not apply to shaft alleys containing no assigned space for the stowage of combustibles. Fire hydrants must be numbered as required by § 196.37-15 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(e) All parts of the fire main located on exposed decks must either be protected against freezing or be fitted with cutout valves and drain valves so that the entire exposed parts of such piping may be shut off and drained in freezing weather. Except when closed to prevent freezing, such valves must be sealed open.</P>
              <P>(f) The outlet at the fire hydrant must be limited to any position from the horizontal to the vertical pointing downward, so that the hose will lead horizontally or downward to minimize the possibility of kinking.</P>
              <P>(g) Each fire hydrant must be provided with a single length of hose with nozzle attached and a spanner wrench. A suitable hose rack or other device must be provided for the proper stowage of the hose. If the hose is not stowed in the open or behind glass so as to be readily seen, the enclosures must be marked in accordance with § 196.37-15 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(h) Firehoses must be connected to the outlets at all times. However, at open decks where no protection is afforded to the hose in heavy weather, the hose may be temporarily removed from the hydrant and stowed in an accessible nearby location.</P>
              <P>(i) Each fire hydrant must have at least 1 length of firehose. Each firehose must have a combination solid stream and water spray nozzle that is approved under subpart 162.027 of this subchapter, except 19 millimeters (3/4 inch) hose may have a garden hose nozzle that is bronze or metal with strength and corrosion resistance equivalent to bronze. Combination solid stream and water spray nozzles previously approved under subpart 162.027 of this chapter may be retained so long as they are maintained in good condition to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.</P>
              <P>(j) When the firehose nozzle in the below locations was previously approved under subpart 162.027 of this chapter, a low-velocity water spray applicator, also previously approved under subpart 162.027, of this chapter must be installed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) At least 1 length of firehose on each fire hydrant outside and in the immediate vicinity of each laboratory; and</P>
              <P>(2) Each firehose in each propulsion machinery space containing oil-fired boiler, internal combustion machinery, or oil fuel unit on a vessel of 1,000 gross tons or more—the length of each applicator must be 1.2 meters (4 feet).</P>
              <P>(k) Fixed brackets, hooks, or other means for stowing an applicator must be next to each fire hydrant that has an applicator under paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(l) Firehose must not be used for any other purpose than fire extinguishing, drills, and testing.</P>
              <P>(m) Fire hydrants, nozzles, and other fittings must have threads to accommodate the hose connections noted in this paragraph. Firehose and couplings must be as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) Couplings must be of brass, bronze, or other equivalent metal. National Standard firehose coupling threads must be used for the 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch and 2<FR>1/2</FR>-inch sizes, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, 9 threads per inch for 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose and 7<FR>1/2</FR> threads per inch for 2<FR>1/2</FR>-inch hose.</P>
              <P>(2) Unlined hose must not be used in the machinery spaces.</P>

              <P>(3) Where <FR>3/4</FR>-inch hose is permitted by Table 193.10-5(a) of this subpart, the <PRTPAGE P="345"/>hose and couplings must be of good commercial grade.</P>
              <P>(4) Each section of firehose used after January 1, 1980 must be lined commercial firehose that conforms to Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc. Standard 19 or Federal Specification ZZ-H-451E. Hose that bears the label of Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc. as lined firehose is accepted as conforming to this requirement. Each section of replacement firehose or any section of new firehose placed aboard a vessel after January 1, 1977 must also conform to the specification required by this paragraph.</P>

              <P>(a) Installations contracted for prior to March 1, 1968, shall meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Existing arrangements, materials, and facilities previously approved shall be considered satisfactory so long as they meet the minimum requirements of this paragraph and they are maintained in good condition to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. Minor repairs, alterations, and replacements may be permitted to the same standards as the original installations. However, all new installations or major replacements shall meet the applicable requirements in this subpart for new installations.</P>
              <P>(2) The details of the systems shall be in general agreement with §§ 193.15-5 through 193.15-40 insofar as is reasonable and practicable, with the exception of § 193.15-5(d) (1), (2), and (4), covering machinery spaces, etc., which systems may be installed in accordance with paragraphs (a) (3) through (6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) In boilerrooms, the bilges shall be protected by a system discharging principally below the floorplates. Perforated pipe may be used in lieu of discharge nozzles for such systems. The number of pounds of carbon dioxide shall be equal to the gross volume of the boilerroom taken to the top of the boilers divided by 36. In the event of an elevated boilerroom which drains to the machinery space, the system shall be installed in the engineroom bilge and the gross volume shall be taken to the flat on which the boilers are installed.</P>
              <P>(4) In machinery spaces where main propulsion internal combustion machinery is installed, the number of pounds of carbon dioxide required shall be equal to the gross volume of the space taken to the under side of the deck forming the hatch opening divided by 22.</P>
              <P>(5) In miscellaneous spaces other than cargo or main machinery spaces the number of pounds of carbon dioxide required shall be equal to the gross volume of the space divided by 22.</P>
              <P>(6) Branch lines to the various spaces other than cargo and similar spaces shall be as noted in Table 193.15-90(a)(6). This table is based on cylinders having discharge outlets and siphon tubes of <FR>3/8</FR>-inch diameter.</P>

Neglect to do so is evidence of neglect of duty. It is desirable that all vessels have available in the pilothouse for convenient reference at all times a file of the applicable Notice to Mariners.</P>

              <P>(b) Local Notices to Mariners, published by each U.S. Coast Guard District, contain announcements and information on changes in aids to navigation and other marine information affecting the safety of navigation on oceans and coastwise and the Great Lakes.

If the exposure period is less than eight hours within the 24 hour period, the difference between eight hours and the time of exposure (that is, the unexposed time) is averaged into the TWA. If the exposure period exceeds eight hours in any 24 hour period, sum the products of each exposure level multiplied by the time at that exposure level. The TWA is the value of that sum divided by eight hours.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination of personal exposure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The employer shall ensure that one or more persons in each type of operation conducted on the vessel which involves the handling of or potential exposure to benzene are monitored. The monitoring must be conducted so as to determine the representative personal exposure of all persons engaged in each particular operation involving benzene. Monitoring one vessel of a class is sufficient for all vessels of that class provided the procedures, equipment, work practices, cargo, and control equipment are substantially the same.</P>
              <P>(2) For long duration operations, such as cargo loading or tank entry, the persons monitored must be monitored to determine the representative TWA for all persons engaged in the operation. The monitoring must be based on breathing zone air samples taken for the duration of the operation or for eight hours, whichever is less.</P>
              <P>(3) For short duration operations, such as tank gauging or hose connection and disconnection, the persons monitored must be monitored to determine the representative short term exposure level for all persons engaged in the operation. The monitoring must be based on 15 minute breathing zone air samples. Brief period measuring devices may be used to determine whether monitoring for the short term exposure level is needed.</P>
              <P>(4) If cargoes with different benzene concentrations are being carried on the vessel, an operation involving the lower concentration cargoes need not be monitored if the same type of operation involving the highest concentration cargo is monitored and found to be below the action level.</P>

              <P>(5) Initial monitoring must be conducted during weather conditions typical in the geographic area and during <PRTPAGE P="403"/>the time of day the operation is normally conducted. If the benzene level is above half the action level for the operation, additional monitoring must be conducted under those weather conditions that will maximize benzene exposure, such as low wind, stable air, and high temperature.</P>
              <P>(6) The monitoring method used must be accurate to a confidence level of 95 percent to within plus or minus 25 percent for airborne concentrations of benzene equal to or greater than 0.5 ppm.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial exposure monitoring.</E> When benzene is first loaded as a cargo on board a vessel, an initial monitoring of each type of operation must be conducted to determine accurately the representative personal exposure of persons involved in the operation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Periodic exposure monitoring.</E> The monitoring must be repeated each July or August if benzene containing cargoes are carried during those months; monitoring must be conducted under those weather conditions that will maximize benzene exposure, such as low wind, stable air, and high temperature. If benzene containing cargoes are not carried during those months, monitoring must be conducted at the time of carriage nearest those months; monitoring must be conducted under those weather conditions that will maximize benzene exposure, such as low wind, stable air, and high temperature.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional exposure monitoring.</E> (1) Monitoring in compliance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be repeated for the operation when there has been a change in the procedure, equipment, or work practices of the operation which may increase personal exposure or whenever the employer or person in charge has any reason to suspect that personal exposure has increased.</P>
              <P>(2) Whenever emergencies occur that may increase personal exposure, operations affected by the emergency must be monitored using area or personal sampling after the spill is cleaned up or the leak, rupture, or other breakdown is repaired to determine when personal exposure has returned to the level that existed before the emergency. There must be monitoring equipment aboard each ship.</P>
              <P>(3) For those cases in which the benzene exposure can vary significantly over the year, the personnel exposure reduction plan can reflect this variation in time if both initial and periodic exposure monitoring are conducted at those times. There must be sufficient monitoring to quantitatively justify differences in the exposure reduction program over the course of the year. The exposure monitoring must be conducted under those weather conditions that will maximize benzene exposure, such as low wind, stable air, and high temperature.</P>
              <P>(4) The Coast Guard may require additional monitoring upon reasonable belief that the PEL's are being exceeded.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Notification of exposure monitoring results.</E> (1) Within 60 working days after the receipt of the results of monitoring in compliance with this section, each person involved in the operation monitored must be given written notice of the results, either by separate letter or by notice posted in a location accessible to all persons involved.</P>
              <P>(2) If the results indicate that the PELs were exceeded, the written notice required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section must state, or refer to a document available to the persons involved which states, the corrective action to be taken to reduce the personal exposure to or below the PELs.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Substance:</E> Benzene.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Performance standard exposure limits:</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Airborne: The maximum time-weighted average (TWA) exposure limit is one part of benzene vapor per million parts of air (one ppm) for an eight-hour workday and the maximum short-term exposure limit (STEL) is five ppm for any 15-minute period.</P>
              <P>(2) Dermal: Eye contact must be prevented and skin contact with liquid benzene must be limited.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Appearance and odor:</E> Benzene is a clear, colorless liquid with a pleasant, sweet odor. The odor of benzene does not provide adequate warning of its hazard.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">II. Health Hazard Data</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Ways in which benzene affects your health.</E> Benzene can affect your health if you inhale it or if it comes in contact with your skin or eyes. Benzene is also harmful if you swallow it.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effects of overexposure.</E> (1) Short-term (acute) overexposure: If you are overexposed to high concentrations of benzene, well above the levels where its odor is first recognizable, you may feel breathless, irritable, euphoric, or giddy and you may experience irritation in your eyes, nose, and respiratory tract. You may develop a headache, feel dizzy, nauseated, or intoxicated. Severe exposures may lead to convulsions and loss of consciousness.</P>
              <P>(2) Long-term (chronic) exposure: Repeated or prolonged exposure to benzene, even at relatively low concentrations, may result in various blood disorders ranging from anemia to leukemia, an irreversible, fatal disease. Many blood disorders associated with benzene exposure may occur without symptoms.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">III. Protective Clothing and Equipment</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Respirators.</E> Respirators are required for those operations in which engineering controls or work practice controls are not feasible for reducing exposure to the permissible level or are not chosen as the method of complying with the performance standard. If respirators are worn, they must have joint Mine Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) seal of approval. Cartridges or canisters must be replaced before the end of their service life, or the end of the shift, whichever occurs first. If you experience difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, you may request a positive pressure respirator from your employer. You must be thoroughly trained to use the assigned respirator, and the training will be provided by your employer.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Protective clothing.</E> You must wear appropriate protective clothing (such as boots, gloves, sleeves, and aprons) over any parts of your body that could be exposed to liquid benzene.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Eye and face protection.</E> You must wear splash-proof safety goggles if it is possible that benzene may get into your eyes. In addition, you must wear a face shield if your face could be splashed with benzene liquid.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">IV. Emergency and First Aid Procedures</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eye and face exposure.</E> If benzene is splashed in your eyes, wash it out immediately with large amounts of water. If irritation persists or vision appears to be affected, see a doctor as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Skin exposure.</E> If benzene is spilled on your clothing or skin, remove the contaminated clothing and wash the exposed skin with large amounts of water and soap immediately. Wash contaminated clothing before you wear it again.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Breathing.</E> If you or any other person breathes in large amounts of benzene, get the exposed person to fresh air at once. Apply artificial respiration if breathing has stopped. Call for medical assistance or a doctor as soon as possible. Never enter any vessel or confined space where the benzene concentration might be high without proper safety equipment and with at least one other <PRTPAGE P="411"/>person present who will stay outside. A life line should be used.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Swallowing.</E> If benzene has been swallowed and the subject is conscious, do not induce vomiting. Call for medical assistance or a doctor immediately.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">V. Medical Requirements</HD>
              <P>If you will be exposed to benzene at a concentration at or above 0.5 ppm as an eight-hour time-weighted average or have been exposed at or above 10 ppm in the past while employed by your current employer, your employer may be required by 46 CFR 197.560 to provide a medical examination and history and laboratory tests. These tests must be provided without cost to you. In addition, if you are accidentally exposed to benzene (either by ingestion, inhalation, or skin/eye contact) under emergency conditions known or suspected to constitute a toxic exposure to benzene, your employer is required to make special laboratory tests available to you.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">VI. Observation of Monitoring</HD>
              <P>The employer is required to conduct monitoring that is representative of your exposure to benzene, and you or your designated representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure and to record the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking place in an area where respirators or personal protective clothing and equipment are required to be worn, you or your representative must wear the protective clothing and equipment (See 46 CFR 197.575.)</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">VII. Access to Records</HD>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Route of Entry</HD>
              <P>Inhalation; skin absorption.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">II. Toxicology</HD>
              <P>Benzene is primarily an inhalation hazard. Systemic absorption may cause depression of the hematopoietic system, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, and leukemia. Inhalation of high concentrations may affect the functioning of the central nervous system. Aspiration of small amounts of liquid benzene immediately causes pulmonary edema and hemorrhage of pulmonary tissue. There is some absorption through the skin. Absorption may be more rapid in the case of abraded skin or if it is present in a mixture or as a contaminant in solvents which are readily absorbed. The defatting action of benzene may produce primary irritation due to repeated or prolonged contact with the skin. High concentrations are irritating to the eyes and the mucous membranes of the nose and respiratory tract.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">III. Signs and Symptoms</HD>
              <P>Direct skin contact with benzene may cause erythema. Repeated or prolonged contact may result in drying, scaling dermatitis or development of secondary skin infections. In addition, benzene is absorbed through the skin. Local effects of benzene vapor or liquid on the eye are slight. Only at very high concentrations is there any smarting sensation in the eye. Inhalation of high concentrations of benzene may have an initial stimulatory effect on the central nervous system characterized by exhilaration, nervous excitation, or giddiness, followed by a period of depression, drowsiness, or fatigue. A sensation of tightness in the chest accompanied by breathlessness may occur and ultimately the victim may lose consciousness. Tremors, convulsions, and death may follow from respiratory paralysis or circulatory collapse in a few minutes to several hours following severe exposures.</P>
              <P>The detrimental effect on the blood-forming system of prolonged exposure to small quantities of benzene vapor is of extreme importance. The hematopoietic system is the chief target for benzene's toxic effects which are manifested by alterations in the levels of formed elements in the peripheral blood. These effects may occur at concentrations of benzene which may not cause irritation of mucous membranes or any unpleasant sensory effects. Early signs and symptoms of benzene morbidity are varied. Often, they are not readily noticed and are non-specific. Complaints of headache, dizziness, and loss of appetite may precede or follow clinical signs. Rapid pulse and low blood pressure, in addition to a physical appearance of anemia, may accompany a complaint of shortness of breath and excessive tiredness. Bleeding from the nose, gums, or mucous membranes and the development of purpuric spots (small bruises) may occur as the condition progresses. Clinical evidence of leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, singly or in combination, may be among the first signs.</P>
              <P>Bone marrow may appear normal, aplastic, or hyperplastic and may not, in all situations, correlate with peripheral blood forming tissues. Because of variations in the susceptibility to benzene morbidity, there is no “typical” blood picture. The onset of effects of prolonged benzene exposure may be delayed for many months or years after the actual exposure has ceased. Identification or correlation with benzene exposure must be sought out in the occupational history.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">IV. Treatment of Acute Toxic Effects</HD>
              <P>Remove from exposure immediately. Make sure you are adequately protected and do not risk being overcome by fumes. Give oxygen or artificial resuscitation, if indicated. Flush eyes, wash skin if contaminated, and remove all contaminated clothing. Symptoms of intoxication may persist following severe exposures. Recovery from mild exposures is usually rapid and complete.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">V. Surveillance and Preventive Considerations</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The principal effects of benzene exposure addressed in 46 CFR part 197, subpart C, appendix A, are pathological changes in the hematopoietic system, reflected by changes in the peripheral blood and manifested clinically as pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, or leukemia. Consequently, the <PRTPAGE P="413"/>medical surveillance program specified in 46 CFR 197.560 is designed to observe, on a regular basis, blood indices for early signs of these effects. Although early signs of leukemia are not usually available, emerging diagnostic technology and innovative regimes are making consistent surveillance for leukemia, as well as other hematopoietic effects, more and more beneficial.</P>
              <P>Initial and periodic medical examinations must be provided as required in 46 CFR 197.560. There are special provisions for medical tests in the event of hematologic abnormalities or emergencies.</P>
              <P>The blood values which require referral to a hematologist or internist are noted in 46 CFR 197.560(d) (i), (ii), and (iii). That section specifies that, if blood abnormalities persist, the employee must be referred unless the physician has good reason to believe that the referral is unnecessary. Examples of conditions that might make a referral unnecessary despite abnormal blood limits are iron or folate deficiency, menorrhagia, or blood loss due to some unrelated medical abnormality.</P>
              <P>Symptoms and signs of benzene toxicity can be non-specific. Only a detailed history and appropriate investigative procedures will enable a physician to rule out or confirm conditions that place the employee at increased risk. To assist the examining physician with regard to which laboratory tests are necessary and when to refer an employee to the specialist, the following guidelines have been established.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Hematology Guidelines.</E> A minimum battery of tests is to be performed by strictly standardized methods.</P>
              <P>(1) Red cell, white cell, platelet counts, white blood cell differential, hematocrit, and red cell indices must be performed by an accredited laboratory. The normal ranges for the red cell and white cell counts are influenced by altitude, race, and sex and, therefore, should be determined by an accredited laboratory in the specific area where the tests are performed.</P>
              <P>Either a decline from an absolute normal or from an individual's base line to a subnormal value or a rise to a supra-normal value are indicative of potential toxicity, particularly if all blood parameters decline. The normal total white blood count is approximately 7,200/mm <SU>3</SU> plus or minus 3,000. For cigarette smokers, the white count may be higher and the upper range may be 2,000 cells higher than normal for the laboratory. In addition, infection, allergies, and some drugs may raise the white cell count. The normal platelet count is approximately 250,000 with a range of 140,000 to 400,000. Counts outside this range should be regarded as possible evidence of benzene toxicity.</P>
              <P>Certain abnormalities found through routine screening are of greater significance in the benzene-exposed worker and require prompt consultation with a specialist, namely:</P>
              <P>(i) Thrombocytopenia.</P>
              <P>(ii) A trend of decreasing white cell, red cell, or platelet indices in an individual over time is more worrisome than an isolated abnormal finding at one test time. The importance of a trend highlights the need to compare an individual's test results to baseline, to previous periodic tests, or to both.</P>
              <P>(iii) A constellation or pattern of abnormalities in the different blood indices is of more significance than a single abnormality. A low white count not associated with any abnormalities in other cell indices may be a normal statistical variation. Whereas, if the low white count is accompanied by decreases in the platelet and/or red cell indices, such a pattern is more likely to be associated with benzene toxicity and merits thorough investigation.</P>
              <P>Anemia, leukopenia, macrocytosis, or an abnormal differential white blood cell count should alert the physician to investigate further and to refer the patient if repeat tests confirm the abnormalities. If routine screening detects an abnormality, the follow-up tests which may be helpful in establishing the etiology of the abnormality are the peripheral blood smear and the reticulocyte count.</P>
              <P>The extreme range of normal for reticulocytes is 0.4 to 2.5 percent of the red cells. The usual range is 0.5 to 1.2 percent of the red cells. A decline in reticulocytes to levels of less than 0.4 percent is to be regarded as possible evidence of benzene toxicity requiring accelerated surveillance (unless another specific cause is found). An increase in reticulocyte levels to above 2.5 percent also may be consistent with, but not characteristic of, benzene toxicity.</P>
              <P>(2) A careful examination of the peripheral blood smear is an important diagnostic test. As with the reticulocyte count, the smear should be with fresh uncoagulated blood obtained from a needle tip following venipuncture or from a drop of earlobe blood (capillary blood). If necessary, the smear may, under certain limited conditions, be made from a blood sample anticoagulated with EDTA (but never with oxalate or heparin). When the smear is to be prepared from a specimen of venous blood which has been collected by a commercial Vacutainer ® type tube containing neutral EDTA, the smear should be made as soon as possible after the venesection. A delay of up to 12 hours is permissible between the drawing of the blood specimen into EDTA and the preparation of the smear if the blood is stored at refrigerator (not freezing) temperature.</P>
              <P>(3) The minimum mandatory observations to be made from the smear are as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The differential white blood cell count.</P>

              <P>(ii) Description of abnormalities in the appearance of red cells.<PRTPAGE P="414"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Description of any abnormalities in the platelets.</P>

              <P>(iv) A careful search must be made of every blood smear for immature white cells such as band forms (in more than normal proportion, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, over ten percent of the total differential count), any number of metamyelocytes, myelocytes, or myeloblasts. Any nucleate or multinucleated red blood cells should be reported. Large “giant” platelets or fragments of megakaryocytes must be recognized.</P>
              <P>An increase in the proportion of band forms among the neutrophilic granulocytes is an abnormality deserving special mention. Such an increase may represent a change which should be considered as an early warning of benzene toxicity in the absence of other causative factors (most commonly infection). Likewise, the appearance of metamyelocytes, in the absence of another probable cause, is to be considered a possible indication of benzene-induced toxicity.</P>
              <P>An upward trend in the number of basophils, which normally do not exceed about 2.0 percent of the total white cells, is to be regarded as possible evidence of benzene toxicity. A rise in the eosinophil count is less specific but may indicate toxicity if the rise is above 6.0 percent of the total white count.</P>
              <P>The normal range of monocytes is from 2.0 to 8.0 percent of the total white count with an average of about 5.0 percent. About 20 percent of individuals reported to have mild but persisting abnormalities caused by exposure to benzene show a persistent monocytosis. The findings of a monocyte count which persists at more than ten to 12 percent of the normal white cell count (when the total count is normal) or persistence of an absolute monocyte count in excess of 800/mm <SU>3</SU> should be regarded as a possible sign of benzene-induced toxicity.</P>
              <P>A less frequent but more serious indication of benzene toxicity is the finding in the peripheral blood of the so-called “pseudo” (or acquired) Pelger-Huet anomaly. In this anomaly, many, or sometimes the majority, of the neutrophilic granulocytes possess two round nuclear segments, or, less often, one or three round segments, rather than three normally elongated segments. When this anomaly is not hereditary, it is often, but not invariably, predictive of subsequent leukemia. However, only about two percent of patients who ultimately develop acute myelogenous leukemia show the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly. Other tests that can be administered to investigate blood abnormalities are discussed below. However, these tests should be undertaken by the hematologist.</P>
              <P>An uncommon sign, which cannot be detected from the smear but can be elicited by a “sucrose water test” of peripheral blood, is transient paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). This sign may first occur insidiously during a period of established aplastic anemia and may be followed within one to a few years by the appearance of rapidly fatal, acute myelogenous leukemia. Clinical detection of PNH, which occurs in only one or two percent of those destined to have acute myelogenous leukemia, may be difficult. If the “sucrose water test” is positive, the somewhat more definitive Ham test, also known as the acid-serum hemolysis test, may provide confirmation.</P>

              <P>(v) Individuals documented to have developed acute myelogenous leukemia years after initial exposure to benzene may have progressed through a preliminary phase of hematologic abnormality. In some instances, pancytopenia (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a lowering in the counts of all circulating blood cells of bone marrow origin, but not to the extent implied by the term “aplastic anemia”) preceded leukemia for many years. Depression of a single blood cell type or platelets may represent a harbinger of aplasia or leukemia. The finding of two or more cytopenias or pancytopenia in a benzene-exposed individual must be regarded as highly suspicious of more advanced, although still reversible, toxicity. Pancytopenia coupled with the appearance of immature cells (myelocytes, myeloblasts, erythroblasts, etc.) with abnormal cells (pseudo Pelger-Huet anomaly, atypical nuclear heterochromatin, etc.) or of unexplained elevations of white blood cells must be regarded as evidence of benzene overexposure, unless proved otherwise. Many severely aplastic patients manifested the ominous finding of five to ten percent myeloblasts in the marrow, occasional myeloblasts and myelocytes in the blood, and 20 to 30 percent monocytes. It is evident that isolated cytopenias, pancytopenias, and even aplastic anemias induced by benzene may be reversible and complete recovery has been reported on cessation of exposure. However, because any of these abnormalities is serious, the employee must immediately be removed from any possible exposure to benzene vapor. Certain tests may substantiate the employee's prospects for progression or regression. One such test would be an examination of the bone marrow, but the decision to perform a bone marrow aspiration or needle biopsy must be made by the hematologist.</P>
              <P>The findings of basophilic stippling in circulating red blood cells (usually found in one to five percent of red cells following marrow injury) and detection in the bone marrow of what are termed “ringed sideroblasts” must be taken seriously, as they have been noted in recent years to be premonitory signs of subsequent leukemia.</P>

              <P>Recently peroxidase-staining of circulating or marrow neutrophil granulocytes, employing benzidine dihydrochloride, have revealed the disappearance of, or diminution in, peroxidase in a sizable proportion of the granulocytes. This has been reported as an <PRTPAGE P="415"/>early sign of leukemia. However, relatively few patients have been studied to date. Granulocyte granules are normally strongly peroxidase positive. A steady decline in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase has also been reported as suggestive of early acute leukemia. Exposure to benzene may cause an early rise in serum iron, often but not always associated with a fall in the reticulocyte count. Thus, serial measurements of serum iron levels may provide a means of determining whether or not there is a trend representing sustained suppression of erythropoiesis.</P>
              <P>Measurement of serum iron and determination of peroxidase and of alkaline phosphatase activity in peripheral granulocytes can be performed in most pathology laboratories. Peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase staining are usually undertaken when the index of suspicion for leukemia is high.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix D to Subpart C of Part 197—Sampling and Analytical Methods for Benzene Monitoring—Measurement Procedures</HD>

              <P>Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure to benzene are best taken so that the representative average eight-hour exposure may be determined from a single eight-hour sample or two four-hour samples. Short-time interval samples (or grab samples) may also be used to determine average exposure level if a minimum of five measurements are taken in a random manner over the eight-hour work shift. In random sampling, any portion of the work shift has the same chance of being sampled as any other. The arithmetic average of all random samples taken on one work shift is an estimate of an employee's average level of exposure for that work shift. Air samples should be taken in the employee's breathing zone (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, air that would most nearly represent that inhaled by the employee). Sampling and analysis must be performed with procedures meeting the requirements of 46 CFR part 197, subpart C.</P>
              <P>There are a number of methods available for monitoring employee exposures to benzene. The sampling and analysis may be performed by collection of the benzene vapor on charcoal adsorption tubes, with subsequent chemical analysis by gas chromatography. Sampling and analysis also may be performed by portable direct reading instruments, real-time continuous monitoring systems, passive dosimeters, or other suitable methods. The employer is required to select a monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of 46 CFR 197.540(a)(6) for the weather conditions expected. Section 197.540(a)(6) requires that monitoring must have an accuracy, to a 95 percent confidence level, of not less than plus or minus 25 percent for concentrations of benzene greater than or equal to 0.5 ppm.</P>
              <P>In developing the following analytical procedures, the OSHA Laboratory modified NIOSH Method S311 and evaluated it at a benzene air concentration of one ppm. A procedure for determining the benzene concentration in bulk material samples was also evaluated. This work, as reported in OSHA Laboratory Method No. 12, includes the following two analytical procedures:</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. OSHA Method 12 for Air Samples</HD>
              <P>Analyte: Benzene.</P>

              <P>1.3. An aliquot of the desorbed sample is injected into a gas chromatograph.</P>
              <P>1.4. The area of the resulting peak is determined and compared with areas obtained from standards.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Advantages and disadvantages of the method</HD>
              <P>2.1. The sampling device is small, portable, and involves no liquids. Interferences are minimal and most of those which do occur can be eliminated by altering chromatographic conditions. The samples are analyzed by means of a quick, instrumental method.</P>
              <P>2.2. The amount of sample which can be taken is limited by the number of milligrams that the tube will hold before overloading.

It can be removed with the following procedure. Heat, under reflux for two to three hours, 500 ml of carbon disulfide, ten ml concentrated sulfuric acid, and five drops of concentrated nitric acid. The benzene is converted to nitrobenzene. The carbon disulfide layer is removed, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and distilled. The recovered carbon disulfide should be benzene free. (It has recently been determined that benzene can also be removed by passing the carbon disulfide through a 13x molecular sieve).</P>
              <P>4.2. Benzene, reagent grade.</P>
              <P>4.3. p-Cymene, reagent grade, (internal standard).</P>
              <P>4.4. Desorbing reagent. The desorbing reagent is prepared by adding 0.05 ml of p-cymene per milliliter of carbon disulfide. (The internal standard offers a convenient means correcting analytical response for slight inconsistencies in the size of sample injections. If the external standard technique is preferred, the internal standard can be eliminated.)</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Procedure</HD>
              <P>5.1. Cleaning of equipment. All glassware used for the laboratory analysis should be properly cleaned and free of organics which could interfere in the analysis.</P>
              <P>5.2. Calibration of personal pumps. Each pump must be calibrated with a representative charcoal tube in the line.</P>
              <P>5.3. Collection and shipping of samples.</P>
              <P>5.3.1. Immediately before sampling, break the ends of the tube to provide an opening at least one-half the internal diameter of the tube (two mm).</P>
              <P>5.3.2. The smaller section of the charcoal is used as the backup and should be placed nearest the sampling pump.</P>
              <P>5.3.3. The charcoal tube should be placed in a vertical position during sampling to minimize channeling through the charcoal.</P>
              <P>5.3.4. Air being sampled should not be passed through any hose or tubing before entering the charcoal tube.</P>
              <P>5.3.5. A sample size of 10 liters is recommended. Sample at a flow rate of approximately 0.2 liters per minute. The flow rate should be known with an accuracy of at least ±five percent.</P>
              <P>5.3.6. The charcoal tubes should be capped with the supplied plastic caps immediately after sampling.</P>
              <P>5.3.7. Submit at least one blank tube (a charcoal tube subjected to the same handling procedures, without having any air drawn through it) with each set of samples.</P>
              <P>5.3.8. Take necessary shipping and packing precautions to minimize breakage of samples.</P>
              <P>5.4. Analysis of samples.</P>
              <P>5.4.1. Preparation of samples. In preparation for analysis, each charcoal tube is scored with a file in front of the first section of charcoal and broken open. The glass wool is removed and discarded. The charcoal in the first (larger) section is transferred to a two ml vial. The separating section of foam is removed and discarded and the second section is transferred to another capped vial. These two sections are analyzed separately.</P>
              <P>5.4.2. Desorption of samples. Before analysis, 1.0 ml of desorbing solution is pipetted into each sample container. The desorbing solution consists of 0.05 µl internal standard per milliliter of carbon disulfide. The sample vials are capped as soon as the solvent is added. Desorption should be done for 30 minutes with occasional shaking.</P>
              <P>5.4.3. GC conditions. Typical operating conditions for the gas chromatograph are as follows:</P>
              <P>1. 30 ml/min (60 psig) helium carrier gas flow.</P>
              <P>2. 30 ml/min (40 psig) hydrogen gas flow to detector.</P>
              <P>3. 240 ml/min (40 psig) air flow to detector.</P>
              <P>4. 150 °C injector temperature.</P>
              <P>5. 250 °C detector temperature.</P>
              <P>6. 100 °C column temperature.</P>
              <P>5.4.4. Injection size. One µl.</P>
              <P>5.4.5. Measurement of area. The peak areas are measured by an electronic integrator or some other suitable form of area measurement.</P>

              <P>5.4.6. An internal standard procedure is used. The integrator is calibrated to report results in ppm for a 10 liter air sample after correction for desorption efficiency.<PRTPAGE P="417"/>
              </P>
              <P>5.5. Determination of desorption efficiency.</P>
              <P>5.5.1. Importance of determination. The desorption efficiency of a particular compound may vary from one laboratory to another and from one lot of chemical to another. Thus, it is necessary to determine, at least once, the percentage of the specific compound that is removed in the desorption process, provided the same batch of charcoal is used.</P>
              <P>5.5.2. Procedure for determining desorption efficiency. The reference portion of the charcoal tube is removed. To the remaining portion, amounts representing 0.5X, 1X, and 2X (X represents target concentration) based on a 10 liter air sample, are injected into several tubes at each level. Dilutions of benzene with carbon disulfide are made to allow injection of measurable quantities. These tubes are then allowed to equilibrate at least overnight. Following equilibration, they are analyzed following the same procedure as the samples. Desorption efficiency is determined by dividing the amount of benzene found by amount spiked on the tube.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Calibration and standards</HD>
              <P>A series of standards varying in concentration over the range of interest is prepared and analyzed under the same GC conditions that will be used on the samples. A calibration curve is prepared by plotting concentration (µg/ml) versus peak area.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Calculations</HD>

              <P>Benzene air concentration can be calculated from the following equation:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">mg/m<SU>3</SU> = (A)(B)/(C)(D)</FP>
              
              <FP>Where:</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">A=µg/ml benzene, obtained from the calibration curve; B = desorption volume (one ml); C = liters of air sampled; and D = desorption efficiency.</FP>
              

              <P>The concentration in mg/m<SU>3</SU> can be converted to ppm (at 25° and 760 mm) with following equation:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">ppm = (mg/m<SU>3</SU>)(24.46)/(78.11).</FP>
              
              <FP>Where:</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">24.46 = molar volume of an ideal gas 25 °C and 760 mm; and 78.11 = molecular weight of benzene.</FP>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Backup data</HD>
              <P>8.1 Detection limit—Air Samples. The detection limit for the analytical procedure is 1.28 ng with a coefficient of variation of 0.023 at this level. This would be equivalent to an air concentration of 0.04 ppm for a 10 liter air sample. This amount provided a chromatographic peak that could be identifiable in the presence of possible interferences. The detection limit data were obtained by making one µl injections of a 1.283 µg/ml standard.</P>

              <P>8.2 Pooled coefficient of variation—Air Samples. The pooled coefficient of variation for the analytical procedure was determined by one µl replicate injections of analytical standards. The standards were 16.04, 32.08, and 64.16 µg/ml, which are equivalent to 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 ppm for a 10 liter air sample respectively.</P>
              <P>8.3 Storage data—Air Samples. Samples were generated at 1.03 ppm benzene at 80% relative humidity, 22 °C, and 643 mm. All samples were taken for 50 minutes at 0.2 liters/min. Six samples were analyzed immediately and the rest of the samples were divided into two groups by fifteen samples each. One group was stored at refrigerated temperature of −25 °C and the other group was stored at ambient temperature (approximately 23 °C). These samples were analyzed over a period of fifteen days. The results are tabulated below.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">II. OSHA Laboratory Method No. 12 for Bulk Samples</HD>
              <P>Analyte: Benzene.</P>
              <P>Matrix: Bulk Samples.</P>
              <P>Procedure: Bulk samples are analyzed directly by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).</P>
              <P>Detection limits: 0.01% by volume.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Principle of the method</HD>
              <P>1.1. An aliquot of the bulk sample to be analyzed is injected into a liquid chromatograph.</P>
              <P>1.2. The peak area for benzene is determined and compared to areas obtained from standards.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Advantages and disadvantages of the method</HD>
              <P>2.1. The analytical procedure is quick, sensitive, and reproducible.</P>
              <P>2.2. Reanalysis of samples is possible.</P>
              <P>2.3. Interferences can be circumvented by proper selection of HPLC parameters.</P>
              <P>2.4. Samples must be free of any particulates that may clog the capillary tubing in the liquid chromatograph. This may require distilling the sample or clarifying with a clarification kit.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Apparatus</HD>
              <P>3.1. Liquid chromatograph equipped with a UV detector.</P>
              <P>3.2. HPLC Column that will separate benzene from other components in the bulk sample being analyzed. The column used for validation studies was a Waters uBondapack C18, 30 cm × 3.9 mm.</P>
              <P>3.3. A clarification kit to remove any particulates in the bulk if necessary.</P>
              <P>3.4. A micro-distillation apparatus to distill any samples if necessary.</P>
              <P>3.5. An electronic integrator or some other suitable method of measuring peak areas.</P>
              <P>3.6. Microliter syringes—ten µl syringe and other convenient sizes for making standards. 10 µl syringe for sample injections.</P>
              <P>3.7. Volumetric flasks, five ml and other convenient sizes for preparing standards and making dilutions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Reagents</HD>
              <P>4.1. Benzene, reagent grade.</P>
              <P>4.2. HPLC grade water, methyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Collection and shipment of samples</HD>
              <P>5.1. Samples should be transported in glass containers with Teflon-lined caps.</P>
              <P>5.2. Samples should not be put in the same container used for air samples</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Analysis of samples</HD>
              <P>6.1. Sample preparation. If necessary, the samples are distilled or clarified. Samples are analyzed undiluted. If the benzene concentration is out of the working range, suitable dilutions are made with isopropyl alcohol.</P>

              <P>6.2. HPLC conditions. The typical operating conditions for the high performance liquid chromatograph are:<PRTPAGE P="419"/>
              </P>
              <P>6.2.1. Mobile phase—Methyl alcohol/water, 50/50.</P>
              <P>6.2.2. Analytical wavelength—254 nm.</P>
              <P>6.2.3. Injection size—10 µl.</P>
              <P>6.3. Measurement of peak area and calibration. Peak areas are measured by an integrator or other suitable means. The integrator is calibrated to report results in % benzene by volume.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Calculations</HD>
              <P>Because the integrator is programmed to report results in % benzene by volume in an undiluted sample, the following equation is used: % Benzene by Volume = A × B.</P>
              <P>Where: A = % by volume on report. B = Dilution Factor. (B = one for undiluted sample).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Backup data</HD>
              <P>8.1. Detection limit—Bulk Samples. The detection limit for the analytical procedure for bulk samples is 0.88 µg, with a coefficient of variation of 0.019 at this level. This amount provided a chromatographic peak that could be identifiable in the presence of possible interferences. The detection limit date were obtained by making ten µl injections of a 0.10% by volume standard.</P>

              <P>Note that respirators (negative pressure or positive pressure) must not be worn when conditions prevent a tight seal between the faceplate and the skin or the proper functioning of the inhalation or exhalation valves. In order for a respirator to protect the wearer, the facepiece must make a proper seal against the wearer's face. Several factors can negatively affect the respirator to face seal and reduce the level of protection afforded by the respirator. Among these are facial shape, temple pieces of eyeglasses, facial abnormalities (e.g., scars and indentations) absence of dentures, hair style or length of hair, specific skin conditions, and facial hair. Therefore, nothing can come between or otherwise interfere with the sealing surface of the respirator and the face or interfere with the function of the inhalation or exhalation valves.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Initial Fit Tests (IFT)</HD>

              <P>(a) The test subject must be allowed to select the most comfortable respirator from a selection of respirators of various sizes. The selection must include at least three sizes of elastomeric facepieces for the type of respirator that is to be tested (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, three sizes of half mask or three sizes of full facepiece).</P>
              <P>(b) Before the selection process, the test subject must be shown how to put on a respirator, how it should be positioned on the face, how to set strap tension, and how to determine a comfortable fit. A mirror must be available to assist the subject in evaluating the fit and positioning the respirator. This instruction is only a preliminary review and must not constitute the subject's formal training on respirator use.</P>

              <P>(c) The test subject must be informed that he or she is being asked to select the respirator which provides the most comfortable fit. Each respirator represents a different size and shape and, if fitted and used properly, should provide adequate protection.<PRTPAGE P="420"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) The test subject must be instructed to hold each facepiece up to the face and eliminate those facepieces which obviously do not give a comfortable fit.</P>
              <P>(e) The more comfortable facepieces must be noted and the most comfortable mask donned and worn at least five minutes to assess comfort. Assistance in assessing comfort may be given by discussing the points in section I(f) of this appendix. If the test subject is not familiar with using a particular respirator, the test subject must be directed to don the mask several times and to adjust the straps each time to become adept at setting proper tension on the straps.</P>
              <P>(f) Assessment of comfort must include reviewing the following points with the test subject and allowing the test subject adequate time to determine the comfort of the respirator:</P>
              <P>(1) Position of the mask on the nose.</P>
              <P>(2) Room for eye protection.</P>
              <P>(3) Room to talk.</P>
              <P>(4) Position of mask on face and cheeks.</P>
              <P>(g) The following criteria must be used to help determine the adequacy of the respirator fit:</P>
              <P>(1) Chin properly placed.</P>
              <P>(2) Adequate strap tension, not overly tightened.</P>
              <P>(3) Fit across nose bridge.</P>
              <P>(4) Respirator of proper size to span distance from nose to chin.</P>
              <P>(5) Tendency of respirator to slip.</P>
              <P>(6) Self-observation in mirror to evaluate fit and respirator position.</P>
              <P>(h) The following negative and positive pressure fit tests must be conducted. Before conducting a negative or positive pressure fit test, the subject must be told to seat the mask on the face by moving the head from side-to-side and up and down slowly while taking in a few slow deep breaths Another facepiece must be selected and retested if the test subject fails the fit check tests.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Positive pressure fit test.</E> The exhalation valve must be closed off and the subject must exhale gently onto the facepiece. The face fit is considered satisfactory if a slight positive pressure can be built up inside the facepiece without any evidence of outward leakage of air at the seal. For most respirators this method of leak testing requires the wearer to first remove the exhalation valve cover before closing off the exhalation valve and then carefully replacing it after the test.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Negative pressure fit test.</E> The inlet opening of the canister or cartridge(s) must be closed off by covering with the palm of the hand(s) or by replacing the filter seal(s). The subject must inhale gently so that the facepiece collapses slightly and hold his or her breath for ten seconds. If the facepiece remains in its slightly collapsed condition and no inward leakage of air is detected, the tightness of the respirator is considered satisfactory.</P>
              <P>(i) The test must not be conducted if the subject has any hair growth between the skin and the facepiece sealing surface, such as stubble beard growth, beard, or long sideburns which cross the respirator sealing surface. Any type of apparel, such as a skull cap or the temple bars of eye glasses, which projects under the facepiece or otherwise interferes with a satisfactory fit must be altered or removed.</P>
              <P>(j) If the test subject exhibits difficulty in breathing during the tests, the subject must be referred to a physician trained in respiratory disease or pulmonary medicine to determine whether the test subject can wear a respirator while performing his or her duties.</P>
              <P>(k) The test subject must be given the opportunity to wear the successfully fitted respirator for a period of two weeks. If at any time during this period the respirator becomes uncomfortable, the test subject must be given the opportunity to select a different facepiece and to be retested.</P>
              <P>(l) Exercise regimen. Before beginning the fit test, the test subject must be given a description of the fit test and of the test subject's responsibilities during the test procedure. The description of the process must include a description of the test exercises that the subject must perform. The respirator to be tested must be worn for at least five minutes before the start of the fit test.</P>
              <P>(m) Test Exercises. The test subject must perform the following exercises in the test environment:</P>
              <P>(1) Normal breathing. In a normal standing position, without talking, the subject must breathe normally.</P>
              <P>(2) Deep breathing. In a normal standing position, the subject must breathe slowly and deeply, taking caution so as to not hyperventilate.</P>
              <P>(3) Turning head side to side. Standing in place, the subject must slowly turn his or her head from side to side between the extreme positions on each side. The subject must hold his or her head at each extreme momentarily and inhale.</P>

              <P>(4) Moving head up and down. Standing in place, the subject must slowly move his or her head up and down. The subject must be instructed to inhale in the up position (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, when looking toward the ceiling).</P>
              <P>(5) Talking. The subject must talk slowly and loudly enough so as to be heard clearly by the test conductor. The subject must count backward from 100, recite a memorized poem or song, or read the following passage:</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rainbow Passage</HD>

              <P>When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the <PRTPAGE P="421"/>shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
              </P>
              <P>(6) Grimace. The test subject must grimace by smiling or frowning.</P>
              <P>(7) Bending over. The test subject must bend at the waist as if to touch the toes or, for test environments such as shroud type QNFT units which prohibit bending at the waist, the subject must jog in place.</P>
              <P>(8) Normal breathing. Same as exercise 1.</P>
              <P>Each test exercise must be performed for one minute, except for the grimace exercise which must be performed for 15 seconds. The test subject must be questioned by the test conductor regarding the comfort of the respirator upon completion of test exercises. If it has become uncomfortable, another respirator must be tried and the subject retested.</P>
              <P>(n) The employer shall certify that a successful fit test has been administered to the test subject. The certification must include the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) Name of employee.</P>
              <P>(2) Type, brand, and size of respirator.</P>
              <P>(3) Date of test.</P>
              <P>Where QNFT is used, the fit factor, strip chart, or other recording of the results of the test must be retained with the certification. The certification must be maintained until the next fit test is administered.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">II. Qualitative Fit Tests (QLFT)</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The employer shall designate specific individuals to administer the respirator qualitative fit test program. The employer may contract for these services.</P>
              <P>(2) The employer shall ensure that persons administering QLFT are able to properly prepare test solutions, calibrate equipment, perform tests, recognize invalid tests, and determine whether the test equipment is in proper working order.</P>
              <P>(3) The employer shall ensure that QLFT equipment is kept clean and maintained so as to operate at the parameters for which it was designed.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Isoamyl acetate tests.</E> (1) Odor threshold screening test. The odor threshold screening test, performed without wearing a respirator, is intended to determine if the test subject can detect the odor of isoamyl acetate.</P>
              <P>(i) Three one-liter glass jars with metal lids must be used.</P>
              <P>(ii) Odor free water (e.g. distilled or spring water) at approximately 25 degrees C must be used for the solutions.</P>
              <P>(iii) An isoamyl acetate (IAA) (also known at isopentyl acetate) stock solution must be prepared by adding one cc of pure IAA to 800 cc of odor free water in a one liter jar and by shaking the jar for 30 seconds. A new solution must be prepared at least weekly.</P>
              <P>(iv) The screening test must be conducted in a room separate from the room used for actual fit testing. The two rooms must be well ventilated but not connected to the same recirculating ventilation system.</P>
              <P>(v) An odor test solution must be prepared in a second one-liter jar by placing 0.4 cc of the stock solution into 500 cc of odor free water using a clean dropper or pipette. The solution must be shaken for 30 seconds and allowed to stand for two to three minutes so that the IAA concentration above the liquid may reach equilibrium. This solution must be used for only one day.</P>
              <P>(vi) A test blank must be prepared in a third one-liter jar by adding 500 cc of odor free water.</P>
              <P>(vii) The odor test jar and the test blank jar must be labeled “1” and “2” for identification. The labels must be placed on the jar lids so that the labels can be periodically peeled off dried, and switched to maintain the integrity of the test.</P>

              <P>(viii) The following instruction must be typed on a card and placed on a table in front of the odor test jar and the test blank jar:
              </P>
              <P>The purpose of this test is to determine if you can smell banana oil at a low concentration. The two bottles in front of you contain water. One of these bottles also contains a small amount of banana oil. Be sure the covers are on tight, then shake each bottle for two seconds. Unscrew the lid of each bottle, one at a time, and sniff at the mouth of the bottle. Indicate to the test conductor which bottle contains banana oil.</P>
              <P>(ix) The mixtures in the jars used in the IAA odor threshold screening must be prepared in an area separate from the test area, in order to prevent olfactory fatigue in the test subject.</P>
              <P>(x) If the test subject is unable to correctly identify the jar containing the odor test solution, the IAA qualitative fit test must not be performed.</P>
              <P>(xi) If the test subject correctly identifies the jar containing the odor test solution, the test subject may proceed to respirator selection and fit testing.</P>
              <P>(2) Isoamyl acetate fit test. (i) The fit test chamber must be a clear 55-gallon drum liner or similar device suspended inverted over a two foot diameter frame so that the top of the chamber is about six inches above the test subject's head. The inside top center of the chamber must have a small hook attached.</P>

              <P>(ii) Each respirator used for the fitting and fit testing must be equipped with organic vapor cartridges or offer protection against <PRTPAGE P="422"/>organic vapors. The cartridges or masks must be changed at least weekly.</P>
              <P>(iii) After selecting, donning, and properly adjusting a respirator, the test subject must wear the respirator to the fit testing room. This room must be separate from the room used for odor threshold screening and respirator selection and must be well ventilated by an exhaust fan, lab hood, or other device to prevent general room contamination.</P>
              <P>(iv) A copy of the test exercises and any prepared text from which the subject is to read must be taped to the inside of the test chamber.</P>
              <P>(v) Upon entering the test chamber, the test subject must be given a six inch by five inch piece of paper towel or other porous, absorbent, single-ply material, folded in half and wetted with 0.75 cc of pure IAA. The test subject must hang the wet towel on the hook at the top of the chamber.</P>
              <P>(vi) Two minutes must be allowed for the IAA test concentration to stabilize before starting the fit test exercises. This would be an appropriate time to talk with the test subject, to explain the fit test, the importance of the subject's cooperation, and the purpose for the head exercises, or to demonstrate some of the exercises.</P>
              <P>(vii) The test subject must be instructed to perform the exercises described in section I(n) of this appendix. If at any time during the test the subject detects the banana like odor of IAA, the test is failed. The subject must be removed quickly from the test chamber and the test area to avoid olfactory fatigue.</P>
              <P>(viii) If the test is failed, the subject must return to the selection room, remove the respirator, repeat the odor sensitivity test, select and don another respirator, return to the test chamber, and again take the IAA fit test. The process must continue until a respirator that fits well is found. If the odor sensitivity test is failed, the subject must wait at least five minutes before retesting to allow odor sensitivity to return.</P>
              <P>(ix) When a respirator is found that passes the test, the subject must demonstrate the efficiency of the respirator by breaking the face seal and taking a breath before exiting the chamber. If the subject cannot detect the odor of IAA, the test is deemed inconclusive and must be rerun.</P>
              <P>(x) When the test subject leaves the chamber, the subject must remove the saturated towel and return it to the person conducting the test. To keep the test area from becoming contaminated, the used towel must be kept in a self-sealing bag to avoid significant IAA concentration build-up in the test chamber for subsequent tests.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Saccharin solution aerosol test.</E> The saccharin solution aerosol test is an alternative qualitative test. Although it is the only validated test currently available for use with particulate disposable dust respirators not equipped with high-efficiency filters, it may also be used for testing other respirators. The entire screening and testing procedure must be explained to the test subject before the conduct of the saccharin test threshold screening test.</P>
              <P>(1) Saccharin taste threshold screening test. The test, performed without wearing a respirator, is intended to determine whether the test subject can detect the taste of saccharin.</P>
              <P>(i) The subject must wear an enclosure about the head and shoulders that is approximately 12 inches in diameter by 14 inches tall with at least the front portion clear. If the enclosure is also used for the saccharin solution aerosol fit test in compliance with section II(c)(2) of this appendix, the enclosure must allow free movements of the head when a respirator is worn. An enclosure substantially similar to the Minnesota, Mining and Manufacturing (3M) hood assembly, parts No. FT 14 and No. FT 15 combined, is adequate.</P>
              <P>(ii) The test enclosure must have a <FR>3/4</FR> inch hole in front of the test subject's nose and mouth area to accommodate the nebulizer nozzle.</P>
              <P>(iii) The test subject must don the test enclosure. Throughout the threshold screening test, the test subject must breathe with mouth wide open and tongue extended.</P>
              <P>(iv) Using a DeVilbiss Model 40 Inhalation Medication Nebulizer, the test conductor must spray the threshold check solution in accordance with II(c)(1)(v) of this appendix into the enclosure. The nebulizer must be clearly marked to distinguish it from the fit test solution nebulizer.</P>
              <P>(v) The threshold check solution consists of 0.83 grams of sodium saccharin USP in one cc of warm water. It may be prepared by putting one cc of the fit test solution (see section II(c)(2)(iv) of this appendix) in 100 cc of distilled water.</P>
              <P>(vi) To produce the aerosol, the nebulizer bulb must be firmly squeezed so that it collapses completely. Then, the bulb must be released and allowed to expand fully.</P>
              <P>(vii) The bulb must be squeezed rapidly ten times and the test subject must be asked whether he or she tastes the saccharin.</P>
              <P>(viii) If the first response is negative, the ten rapid squeezes must be repeated and the test subject is again asked whether he or she tastes the saccharin.</P>
              <P>(ix) If the second response is negative, ten more squeezes are repeated rapidly and the test subject again asked whether the saccharin is tasted.</P>
              <P>(x) The test conductor must take note of the number of squeezes required to solicit a taste response.</P>

              <P>(xi) If the saccharin is not tasted after 30 squeezes, the test subject may not perform the saccharin fit test.<PRTPAGE P="423"/>
              </P>
              <P>(xii) If a taste response is elicited, the test subject must be asked to take note of the taste for reference in the fit test.</P>
              <P>(xiii) Correct use of the nebulizer means that approximately one cc of liquid is used at a time in the nebulizer body.</P>
              <P>(xiv) The nebulizer must be thoroughly rinsed in water, shaken dry, and refilled at least each morning and afternoon or at least every four-hours.</P>
              <P>(2) Saccharin solution aerosol fit test. (i) The test subject may not eat, drink (except plain water), or chew gum for 15 minutes before the test.</P>
              <P>(ii) The fit test must be conducted with the same type of enclosure used for the saccharin taste threshold screening test in accordance with section II(c)(1) of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(iii) The test subject must don the enclosure while wearing the respirator selected in the saccharin taste threshold screening test. The respirator must be properly adjusted and equipped with a particulate filter(s).</P>
              <P>(iv) A second DeVilbiss Model 40 Inhalation Medication Nebulizer must be used to spray the fit test solution into the enclosure. This nebulizer must be clearly marked to distinguish it from the nebulizer used for the threshold check solution in accordance with section II(c)(1)(iv) of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(v) The fit test solution must be prepared by adding 83 grams of sodium saccharin to 100 cc of warm water.</P>
              <P>(vi) The test subject must breathe with mouth wide open and tongue extended.</P>
              <P>(vii) The nebulizer must be inserted into the hole in the front of the enclosure and the fit test solution must be sprayed into the enclosure using the same number of squeezes required to elicit a taste response in the screening test in accordance with sections II(c)(1)(vi) through II(c)(1)(xi) of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(viii) After generating the aerosol, the test subject must be instructed to perform the exercises in section I(n) of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(ix) Every 30 seconds, the aerosol concentration must be replenished using one half the number of squeezes used initially.</P>
              <P>(x) The test subject must indicate to the test conductor if, at any time during the fit test, the taste of saccharin is detected.</P>
              <P>(xi) If the taste of saccharin is detected, the fit must be deemed unsatisfactory and a different respirator must be tried.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Irritant fume test.</E> The irritant fume test is an alternative qualitative fit test.</P>
              <P>(1) The respirator to be tested must be equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters.</P>
              <P>(2) The test subject must be allowed to smell a weak concentration of the irritant smoke before the respirator is donned to become familiar with the smoke's characteristic odor.</P>
              <P>(3) Both ends of a ventilation smoke tube containing stannic oxychloride, such as the Marine Safety Appliance part No. 5645 or equivalent, must be broken. One end of the smoke tube must be attached to a low flow air pump set to deliver 200 milliliters per minute.</P>
              <P>(4) The test subject must be advised that the smoke may be irritating to the eyes and that the subject must keep his or her eyes closed while the test is performed.</P>
              <P>(5) The test conductor must direct the stream of irritant smoke from the smoke tube towards the face seal area of the test subject. The test must be started with the smoke tube at least 12 inches from the facepiece, moved gradually to within one inch, and moved around the whole perimeter of the mask</P>
              <P>(6) Each test subject who passes the smoke test without evidence of a response must be given a sensitivity check of the smoke from the same tube once the respirator has been removed. This check is necessary to determine whether the test subject reacts to the smoke. Failure to evoke a response voids the fit test.</P>
              <P>(7) The fit test must be performed in a location with exhaust ventilation sufficient to prevent general contamination of the testing area by the irritant smoke.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">III. Quantitative Fit Tests (ONFT)</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The employer shall designate specific individuals to administer the respirator quantitative fit test program.</P>
              <P>(2) The employer shall ensure that persons administering QNFT are able to properly calibrate equipment, perform tests, recognize invalid tests, calculate fit factors, and determine whether the test equipment is in proper working order.</P>
              <P>(3) The employer shall ensure that QNFT equipment is kept clean and maintained so as to operate at the parameters for which it was designed.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) <E T="03">Quantitative fit test</E> means a test which is performed in a test chamber and in which the normal air-purifying element of the respirator is replaced with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, in the case of particulate QNFT aerosols, or with a sorbent offering contaminant penetration protection equivalent to high-efficiency filters, if the QNFT test agent is a gas or vapor.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Maximum peak penetration method</E> means the method of determining test agent penetration in the respirator as determined by strip chart recordings of the test. The highest peak penetration for a given exercise is taken to be representative of average penetration into the respirator for that exercise.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Average peak penetration method</E> means the method of determining test agent penetration into the respirator by using a strip chart recorder, integrator, or computer. The agent penetration is determined by an average of the peak heights on the graph, or by computer integration, for each exercise except the grimace exercise. Integrators or computers which calculate the actual test agent penetration into the respirator for each exercise also may be used in accordance with this method.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Fit factor</E> means the ratio of challenge agent concentration outside with respect to the inside of a respirator inlet covering (facepiece or enclosure).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Apparatus.</E> (1) Instrumentation. Aerosol generation, dilution, and measurement systems using corn oil or sodium chloride as test aerosols must be used for quantitative fit testing.</P>
              <P>(2) Test chamber. The test chamber must be large enough to permit all test subjects to perform freely all required exercises without disturbing the challenge agent concentration or the measurement apparatus. The test chamber must be equipped and constructed so that the challenge agent is effectively isolated from the ambient air, yet is uniform in concentration throughout the chamber.</P>
              <P>(3) When testing air-purifying respirators, the normal filter or cartridge element must be replaced with a high-efficiency particulate filter supplied by the same manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(4) The sampling instrument must be selected so that a strip chart record may be made of the test showing the rise and fall of the challenge agent concentration with each inspiration and expiration at fit factors of at least 2,000. Integrators or computers which integrate the amount of test agent penetration leakage into the respirator for each exercise may be used if a record of the readings is made.</P>
              <P>(5) The combination of substitute air-purifying elements, challenge agent, and challenge agent concentration in the test chamber must be such that the test subject is not exposed to a concentration of the challenge agent in excess of the established exposure limit for the challenge agent at any time during the testing process.</P>
              <P>(6) The sampling port on the test specimen respirator must be placed and constructed so that no leakage occurs around the port (e.g. where the respirator is probed), so that a free air flow is allowed into the sampling line at all times, and so that there is no interference with the fit or performance of the respirator.</P>
              <P>(7) The test chamber and test set up must permit the person administering the test to observe the test subject inside the chamber during the test.</P>
              <P>(8) The equipment generating the challenge atmosphere must maintain a constant concentration of challenge agent inside the test chamber to within a ten percent variation for the duration of the test.</P>
              <P>(9) The time lag (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the interval between an event and the recording of the event on the strip chart, computer, or integrator) must be kept to a minimum. There must be a clear association between the occurrence of an event inside the test chamber and the recording of that event.</P>
              <P>(10) The sampling line tubing for the test chamber atmosphere and for the respirator sampling port must be of equal diameter and of the same material. The length of the two lines must be equal.</P>
              <P>(11) The exhaust flow from the test chamber must pass through a high-efficiency filter before release.</P>
              <P>(12) When sodium chloride aerosol is used, the relative humidity inside the test chamber must not exceed 50 percent.</P>
              <P>(13) The limitations of instrument detection must be taken into account when determining the fit factor.</P>
              <P>(14) Test respirators must be maintained in proper working order and inspected for deficiencies, such as cracks, missing valves, and gaskets.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedural requirements.</E> (1) When performing the initial positive or negative pressure test, the sampling line must be crimped closed in order to avoid air pressure leakage during either of these tests.</P>
              <P>(2) In order to reduce the amount of QNFT time, an abbreviated screening isoamyl acetate test or irritant fume test may be used in order to quickly identify poor fitting respirators which passed the positive or negative pressure test. When performing a screening isoamyl acetate test, combination high-efficiency organic vapor cartridges or canisters must be used.</P>
              <P>(3) A reasonably stable challenge agent concentration must be measured in the test chamber before testing. For canopy or shower curtain type of test units, the determination of the challenge agent stability may be established after the test subject has entered the test environment.</P>
              <P>(4) Immediately after the subject enters the test chamber, the challenge agent concentration inside the respirator must be measured to ensure that the peak penetration does not exceed five percent for a half mask or one percent for a full facepiece respirator.</P>

              <P>(5) A stable challenge concentration must be obtained before the actual start of testing.<PRTPAGE P="425"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) Respirator restraining straps must not be overtightened for testing. The straps must be adjusted by the wearer without assistance from other persons to give a fit reasonably comfortable for normal use.</P>
              <P>(7) After obtaining a stable challenge concentration, the test subject must be instructed to perform the exercises described in section I(n) of this appendix. The test must be terminated whenever any single peak penetration exceeds five percent for half masks and one percent for full facepiece respirators. The test subject must be refitted and retested. If two of the three required tests are terminated, the fit is deemed inadequate.</P>
              <P>(8) In order to successfully complete a QNFT, three successful fit tests must be conducted. The results of each of the three independent fit tests must exceed the minimum fit factor needed for the class of respirator (e.g., half mask respirator, full facepiece respirator).</P>
              <P>(9) Calculation of fit factors. (i) The fit factor must be determined for the quantitative fit test by taking the ratio of the average chamber concentration to the concentration inside the respirator.</P>
              <P>(ii) The average test chamber concentration is the arithmetic average of the test chamber concentration at the beginning and of the end of the test.</P>
              <P>(iii) The concentration of the challenge agent inside the respirator must be determined by one of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(A) Average peak concentration.</P>
              <P>(B) Maximum peak concentration.</P>
              <P>(C) Integration by calculation of the area under the individual peak for each exercise. This includes computerized integration.</P>
              <P>(10) Interpretation of test results. The fit factor established by the quantitative fit testing must be the lowest of the three fit factor values calculated from the three required fit tests.</P>
              <P>(11) The test subject must not be permitted to wear a half mask or a full facepiece respirator unless a minimum fit factor equivalent to at least ten times the hazardous exposure level is obtained.</P>
              <P>(12) Filters used for quantitative fit testing must be replaced at least weekly, whenever increased breathing resistance is encountered, or whenever the test agent has altered the integrity of the filter media. When used, organic vapor cartridges and canisters must be replaced daily or whenever there is an indication of a breakthrough by a test agent.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 197—Air No-Decompression Limits</HD>
              <P>The following table gives the depth versus bottom time limits for single, no-decompression, air dives made within any 12-hour period. The limit is the maximum bottom time in minutes that a diver can spend at that depth without requiring decompression beyond that provided by a normal ascent rate of 60 fsw per minute. (Although bottom time is concluded when ascent begins, a slower ascent rate would increase the bottom time thereby requiring decompression.) An amount of nitrogen remains in the tissues of a diver after any air dive, regardless of whether the dive was a decompression or no-decompression dive. Whenever another dive is made within a 12-hour period, the nitrogen remaining in the blood and body tissues of the diver must be considered when calculating his decompression.</P>

The briefing must include the instructions required by § 199.80 and must be made by means of an announcement in one or more languages likely to be understood by the passengers and special personnel. The announcement must be made on the vessel's public address system or by other equivalent means likely to be heard by the passengers and special personnel who have not yet heard it during the voyage. The briefing may be included in the muster required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section if the muster is held immediately upon departure. Information cards or posters, or video programs displayed on the vessel video displays, may be used to supplement the briefing, but may not be used to replace the announcement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Drills—general.</E> (1) Drills must, as far as practicable, be conducted as if there were an actual emergency.</P>
              <P>(2) Every crewmember must participate in at least one abandon-ship drill and one fire drill every month. The drills of the crew must take place within 24 hours of the vessel leaving a port if more than 25 percent of the crew have not participated in abandon-ship and fire drills on board that particular vessel in the previous month.</P>
              <P>(3) Drills must be held before sailing when a vessel enters service for the first time, after modification of a major character, or when a new crew is engaged.</P>
              <P>(4) The OCMI may accept other equivalent drill arrangements for those classes of vessels for which compliance with this paragraph is impracticable.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Abandon-ship drills.</E> (1) Abandon-ship drills must include—</P>
              <P>(i) Summoning persons on board to muster stations with the general alarm followed by drill announcements on the public address or other communication system and ensuring that the persons on board are made aware of the order to abandon ship;</P>
              <P>(ii) Reporting to stations and preparing for the duties described in the muster list;</P>
              <P>(iii) Checking that persons on board are suitably dressed;</P>
              <P>(iv) Checking that lifejackets or immersion suits are correctly donned;</P>
              <P>(v) Lowering of at least one lifeboat after any necessary preparation for launching;</P>
              <P>(vi) Starting and operating the lifeboat engine; and</P>
              <P>(vii) Operating davits used for launching the liferafts.</P>
              <P>(2) Abandon-ship drills should also include conducting a mock search and rescue of passengers or special personnel trapped in their staterooms, and giving instructions in the use of radio lifesaving appliances.</P>
              <P>(3) Different lifeboats must, as far as practicable, be lowered to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section at successive drills.</P>
              <P>(4) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(5) and (d)(6) of this section, each lifeboat must be launched with its assigned operating crew aboard and maneuvered in the water at least once every 3 months during an abandon-ship drill.</P>

              <P>(5) Lowering into the water, rather than launching of a lifeboat arranged for free-fall launching, is acceptable when free-fall launching is impracticable, provided that the lifeboat is <PRTPAGE P="454"/>free-fall launched with its assigned operating crew aboard and is maneuvered in the water at least once every 6 months. However, when compliance with the 6-month requirement is impracticable, the OCMI may extend this period to 12 months, provided that arrangements are made for simulated launching at intervals of not more than 6 months.</P>
              <P>(6) The OCMI may exempt a vessel operating on short international voyages from the requirement to launch the lifeboats on both sides of the vessel if berthing arrangements in port and operations do not permit launching of lifeboats on one side. However, all lifeboats on the vessel must be lowered at least once every 3 months and launched at least annually.</P>
              <P>(7) As far as is reasonable and practicable, rescue boats, other than lifeboats which are also rescue boats, must be launched with their assigned crew aboard and maneuvered in the water each month. Such launching and maneuvering must occur at least once every 3 months.</P>
              <P>(8) If lifeboat and rescue boat launching drills are carried out with the vessel making headway, such drills must, because of the dangers involved, be practiced in sheltered waters only and be under the supervision of an officer experienced in such drills.</P>
              <P>(9) If a vessel is fitted with marine evacuation systems, drills must include an exercising of the procedures required for the deployment of such a system up to the point immediately preceding actual deployment of the system. This aspect of drills should be augmented by regular instruction using the on board training aids. Additionally, every crewmember assigned to duties involving the marine evacuation system must, as far as practicable, participate in a full deployment of a similar system into water, either on board a vessel or ashore, every 2 years but not longer than every 3 years. This training may be associated with the deployments required by § 199.190(k).</P>
              <P>(10) Emergency lighting for mustering and abandonment must be tested at each abandon-ship drill.</P>
              <P>(11) If a vessel carries immersion suits or anti-exposure suits, the suits must be worn by crewmembers in at least one abandon ship drill in any three-month period. If wearing the suits is impracticable due to warm weather, the crewmembers must be instructed on their donning and use.</P>
              <P>(12) If a vessel carries immersion suits for persons other than the crew, the abandon-ship drill must include instruction to these persons on the stowage, donning, and use of the suits.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Line-throwing appliance.</E> A drill must be conducted on the use of the line-throwing appliance at least once every 3 months. The actual firing of the appliance is at the discretion of the master.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Fire drills.</E> (1) Fire drills must, as far as practicable, be planned with due consideration given to the various emergencies that may occur for that type of vessel and its cargo.</P>
              <P>(2) Each fire drill must include—</P>
              <P>(i) Reporting to stations and preparing for the duties described in the muster list for the particular fire emergency being simulated;</P>
              <P>(ii) Starting of fire pumps and the use of two jets of water to determine that the system is in proper working order;</P>
              <P>(iii) Checking the firemen's outfits and other personal rescue equipment;</P>
              <P>(iv) Checking the relevant communications equipment;</P>
              <P>(v) Checking the operation of watertight doors, fire doors, and fire dampers and main inlets and outlets of ventilation systems in the drill area; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Checking the necessary arrangements for subsequent abandonment of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(3) The equipment used during drills must immediately be brought back to its fully operational condition. Any faults and defects discovered during the drills must be remedied as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Onboard training and instruction.</E> (1) Onboard training in the use of the vessel's lifesaving appliances, including survival craft equipment, and in the use of the vessel's fire-extinguishing appliances must be given as soon as possible but not later than 2 weeks after a crewmember joins the vessel.</P>

              <P>(2) If the crewmember is on a regularly scheduled rotating assignment to <PRTPAGE P="455"/>the vessel, the training required in paragraph (g)(1) of this section need be given only within 2 weeks of the time the crewmember first joins the vessel.</P>
              <P>(3) The crew must be instructed in the use of the vessel's fire-extinguishing and lifesaving appliances and in survival at sea at the same interval as the drills. Individual units of instruction may cover different parts of the vessel's lifesaving and fire-extinguishing appliances, but all the vessel's lifesaving and fire-extinguishing appliances must be covered within any period of 2 months.</P>
              <P>(4) Every crewmember must be given instructions that include, but are not limited to—</P>
              <P>(i) The operation and use of the vessel's inflatable liferafts;</P>
              <P>(ii) The problems of hypothermia, first aid treatment for hypothermia, and other appropriate first aid procedures;</P>
              <P>(iii) Any special instructions necessary for use of the vessel's lifesaving appliances in severe weather and severe sea conditions; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The operation and use of fire-extinguishing appliances.</P>
              <P>(5) Onboard training in the use of davit-launched liferafts must take place at intervals of not more than 4 months on each vessel with davit-launched liferafts. Whenever practicable, this training must include the inflation and lowering of a liferaft. If this liferaft is a special liferaft intended for training purposes only and is not part of the vessel's lifesaving equipment, this liferaft must be conspicuously marked.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Records.</E> (1) When musters are held, details of abandon-ship drills, fire drills, drills of other lifesaving appliances, and onboard training must be recorded in the vessel's official logbook. Logbook entries must include—</P>
              <P>(i) The date and time of the drill, muster, or training session;</P>
              <P>(ii) The survival craft and fire-extinguishing equipment used in the drills;</P>
              <P>(iii) Identification of inoperative or malfunctioning equipment and the corrective action taken;</P>
              <P>(iv) Identification of crewmembers participating in drills or training sessions; and</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Lifejackets approval series.</E> As an alternative to a lifejacket meeting the approval requirements in § 199.70, vessels may carry a lifejacket approved under approval series 160.002, 160.005, 160.055, or 160.077.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Lifejacket quantity.</E> Vessels may carry lifejackets as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If lifejackets are stowed in cabins, staterooms, or berthing areas that are readily accessible to each watch or work station, the requirement in § 199.70(b)(2)(iv) to have lifejackets at each watch or work station need not be met.</P>
              <P>(2) If the vessel carries lifejackets that are designated extended-size, then the number of child-size lifejackets carried to meet § 199.70(b)(1)(i) may be reduced. To take the reduction in child-size lifejackets, extended-size lifejackets having the same lower size limit must be substituted for all of the required adult lifejackets. The number of child-size lifejackets required depends on the lower size limit of the extended-size lifejackets and is calculated by any one of the following formulas where PC is the number of child-size lifejackets expressed as a percentage of the number of lifejackets required under § 199.70(b)(1):</P>
              <P>(i) PC = LS ÷ 4.1, where LS equals the lower size limit expressed in kilograms.</P>
              <P>(ii) PC = LS ÷ 9, where LS equals the lower size limit expressed in pounds.</P>
