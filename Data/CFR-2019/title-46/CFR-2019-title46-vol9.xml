      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(3) Deemed to have occurred by notification of the withdrawal of the next to last party to an agreement without notification of the addition of another party prior to the effective date of the next to last party's withdrawal.</P>
              <P>(i) Authority to determine whether agreements for the use or operation of terminal property or facilities, or the furnishing of terminal services, are within the purview of section 5 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40301 (d)-(e), 40302-40303, 40305).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope of rules in this part.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The rules in this part govern procedure before the Federal Maritime Commission, hereinafter referred to as the “Commission,” under the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, Merchant Marine Act, 1936, Shipping Act of 1984, as amended by the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, Administrative Procedure Act, and related acts, except that subpart R of this part does not apply to proceedings subject to sections 7 and 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act, which are to be governed only by subparts A to Q inclusive, of this part. They shall be construed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every proceeding. To this end, all persons involved in proceedings conducted under the rules of this part shall be required to consider at an early stage of the proceeding whether resort to alternative dispute resolution techniques would be appropriate or useful. [Rule 1.]</P>

              <SUBJECT>Filing of documents.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement for filing.</E> Documents relating to any matter pending before the Commissioners for decision or to any matter pending before the Commission which is likely to come before the Commissioners for decision, whether or not relating to proceedings governed by this part, must be filed with the Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission. Such documents should not be filed with or separately submitted to the offices of individual Commissioners. Distribution to Commissioners and other agency personnel is handled <PRTPAGE P="23"/>by the Office of the Secretary to ensure that persons in decision-making and advisory positions receive identical copies of submissions in a uniform and impersonal manner and to avoid the possibility of ex parte communications within the meaning of § 502.11. These considerations apply to informal and oral communications as well, such as requests for expedited consideration.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Date and time of filing.</E> (1) Documents may be hand-delivered at the Commission during normal business hours from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.</P>
              <P>(2) Except with respect to initial filing of complaints pursuant to §§ 502.62 and 502.63, and claims pursuant to §§ 502.301 and 502.302, the date of filing shall be either the date on which the pleading, document, or paper is physically delivered to the Commission by a party, the date on which a party certifies it to have been deposited in the mail or delivered to a courier, or the date of e-mail transmission.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Place of filing.</E> Except for exhibits filed pursuant to § 502.118(b)(4) and petitions for review of final agency orders served on the Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2112(a), all documents required to be filed in, and correspondence relating to proceedings governed by this part must be addressed and delivered to “Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 N.

Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20573-0001.”</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Number of copies.</E> Parties filing documents in proceedings before the Commission or an administrative law judge must file an original, signed document and five (5) copies, and, if possible, a PDF of the document. The PDF document should be sent by e-mail to <E T="03">secretary@fmc.gov</E> or submitted on an electronic storage device (such as compact disc or USB flash drive).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">E-mail transmission of filings.</E> (1) Initial filing of complaints and claims pursuant to §§ 502.62-502.63 and 502.301-502.302 must be accomplished in the traditional manner on paper, rather than by e-mail.</P>
              <P>(2) Pursuant to § 502.5 of this subpart, confidential filings must be accomplished in the traditional manner on paper, rather than by e-mail.</P>

              <P>(3) If a filing is submitted electronically as a PDF attached to an e-mail, the original, signed document, and five (5) copies must be received by the Secretary within seven working days. The e-mail transmitting the PDF copy of a document must include a certification by the filing party that the electronic copy is a true and correct copy of the paper original, and that the paper signed original and five (5) copies are being filed with the Secretary of the Commission. The e-mail Subject Line must include the docket number of the proceeding and be sent to <E T="03">secretary@fmc.gov.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Filing after announcement of Commission meeting prohibited.</E> No filings relating to matters scheduled for a Commission meeting will be accepted by the Secretary if submitted subsequent to public announcement of the particular meeting, except that the Commission, on its own initiative, or pursuant to a written request, may in its discretion, permit a departure from this limitation for exceptional circumstances. (See § 503.82(e) of this chapter.)</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Return of rejected filings.</E> Any pleading, document, writing, or other paper submitted for filing which is rejected because it does not conform to the rules in this part will be returned to the sender.</P>

An <PRTPAGE P="24"/>original signed in ink must be provided. Text shall appear on only one side of the paper and must be double spaced except that quotations of fifty or more words should be single-spaced and indented on the left and right without quotation marks. The paper must be strong and durable, of letter size (8<FR>1/2</FR> × 11 in. or 215.9 × 279.4 mm) or A4 size (8.27 × 11.69 in. or 210 × 297 mm), with a margin of at least one inch on all four sides. Documents must be printed in clear type, and the type size, including footnotes and endnotes, must not be smaller than 12-point.</P>

              <P>(v) Expert witness reports.</P>
              <P>(2) The party that served the notice of deposition or discovery papers must preserve and ensure the integrity of original transcripts and discovery papers for use by the Commission or the presiding officer. A party that wants to use any part or all of discovery requests and responses in the proceeding must include the part or all of the documents in an appendix to be filed with the motion or other paper that refers to those documents.

              <SUBJECT>Documents containing confidential materials.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Except as otherwise provided in the rules of this part, all filings that contain information for which confidential treatment is sought or information previously designated as confidential pursuant to §§ 502.13, 502.141(j)(1)(vii), 502.208, or any other rules of this part, or for which a request for protective order pursuant to § 502.141(j) is pending, are subject to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Two versions of filings.</E> Two versions of documents must be filed if a document:</P>
              <P>(1) Contains information previously designated by the Commission or presiding officer as confidential; or</P>
              <P>(2) Contains information for which confidential treatment is sought. Except as specified below, both versions must be filed in accordance with the requirements of § 502.2.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Confidential version.</E> The confidential filing must include a cover page marked “Confidential-Restricted.” The specific confidential information must be conspicuously and clearly marked on each page, for example by highlighting or bracing. If confidentiality will end on a date certain or upon the occurrence of an event, this must be stated on the cover, e.g., “CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL [DATE],” or “CONFIDENTIAL DURING JUDICIAL REVIEW.” The confidential version of a document may be provided to the presiding officer by email but should not be filed with the Office of the Secretary by email.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Public version.</E> Within three business days of filing a confidential version of a filing, a public version <PRTPAGE P="25"/>must be filed. The public version must indicate on the cover page and on each affected page “Public Version—confidential materials excluded.” The public version must clearly indicate any information withheld, for example with blackout or braces, and its pagination and depiction of text on each page must be identical to that of the confidential version. For example, the confidential filing may read: “On January 1, 2005, complainant entered into a {25} year lease with respondent for a monthly rent of {$1,000}.” The public version would read: “On January 1, 2005, complainant entered into a { } year lease with respondent for a monthly rent of { }.” Public versions of confidential filings may be filed with the Secretary and presiding officer by email.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> Confidential information in exhibits should be marked as specified above. If marking within the text is not feasible, individual pages may be replaced in the public version with a page indicating that confidential material is excluded. Entire exhibits should not be excluded, only those pages containing confidential material.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Motion for confidential treatment.</E> If confidentiality is sought for a filing containing information not previously designated as confidential by the Commission or presiding officer, the confidential filing must be accompanied by a motion justifying confidential treatment. This motion must identify the specific information in a document for which protection is sought and show good cause by demonstrating that the information is a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information pursuant to § 502.141(j)(1)(vii). The burden is on the party that wants to protect the information to show good cause for its protection. A motion is not required for information, including personal privacy and financial account numbers, redacted pursuant to § 502.13, Privacy protection for filings made with the Commission.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of confidential information.</E> Confidential treatment afforded by this section is subject to the proviso that any information designated as confidential may be used by the administrative law judge or the Commission if deemed necessary to a decision in the proceeding.

              <SUBJECT>Verification of documents.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If a party is represented by an attorney or other person qualified to practice before the Commission under the rules in this part, each pleading, document or other paper of such party filed with the Commission shall be signed by at least one person of record admitted to practice before the Commission in his or her individual name, whose address shall be stated. Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, such pleading, document or paper need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit. The signature of a person admitted or qualified to practice before the Commission constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the pleading, document or paper; that the signer is authorized to file it; that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the filing is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. For a willful violation of this section, a person admitted or qualified to practice before the Commission may be subjected to appropriate disciplinary action.</P>
              <P>(b) If a party is not represented by a person admitted or qualified to practice before the Commission, each pleading, document or other paper of such party filed with the Commission shall be signed and verified under oath by the party or by a duly authorized officer or agent of the party, whose address and title shall be stated.</P>

              <P>(c) Wherever, under any rules of this part, any matter is required or permitted to be supported, evidenced, established, or proved by the sworn declaration, verification, certificate, statement, oath, or affidavit, in writing of the person making the same (other than a deposition under§ 502.143 or § 502.144), such matter may, with like <PRTPAGE P="26"/>force and effect, be supported, evidenced, established, or proved by the unsworn declaration, certificate, verification, or statement, in writing of such person which is subscribed by such person, as true under penalty of perjury, in substantially the following form:</P>
              <P>(1) If executed without the United States: “I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the foregoing is true and correct.”</P>
              <P>(2) If executed within the United States, its territories, possessions, or commonwealths: “I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.” [Rule 6.]</P>

              <P>(a) No person who is a party to or an agent of a party to any proceeding as defined in § 502.61 or who directly participates in any such proceeding and no interested person outside the Commission shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any Commission member, administrative law judge, or Commission employee who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in the decisional process of any such proceeding, an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding;</P>
              <P>(b) No Commission member, administrative law judge, or Commission employee who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in the decisional process of any agency proceeding, shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any interested persons outside the Commission or to any party to the proceeding or its agent or to any direct participant in a proceeding, an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding. This prohibition shall not be construed to prevent any action authorized by paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of this section;</P>

              <P>(c) “Ex parte communication” means an oral or written communication not on the public record with respect to which reasonable prior notice to all parties is not given, but it shall not include requests for status reports or <PRTPAGE P="27"/>communications regarding purely procedural matters or matters which the Commission or member thereof, administrative law judge, or Commission employee is authorized by law or these rules to dispose of on an ex parte basis;</P>
              <P>(d) Any Commission member, administrative law judge, or Commission employee who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in the decisional process of any proceeding who receives, or who makes or knowingly causes to be made, an ex parte communication shall promptly transmit to the Secretary of the Commission:</P>
              <P>(1) All such written communications;</P>
              <P>(2) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; and</P>

              <P>(f) Upon receipt of an ex parte communication knowingly made or knowingly caused to be made by a party to a proceeding, the Commission or the presiding officer may, to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the statutes administered by the Commission, require the party to show cause why his or her claim or interest in the proceeding should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of the making of such communication;</P>
              <P>(g) An ex parte communication shall not constitute a part of the record for decision. The Commission or the presiding officer may, to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the statutes administered by the Commission, consider a violation of paragraph (b) of this section sufficient grounds for a decision adverse to a party who has knowingly caused such violation to occur and may take such other action as may be appropriate under the circumstances.

The statements contained in the affidavit shall not be sufficient if disproved by an examination of the files and records of the case.</P>
              <P>(3) The applicant shall be promptly advised as to his or her privilege to appear, represent or communicate in the particular matter, and the application, affidavit and consent, or refusal to consent, shall be filed by the Commission in its records relative thereto.</P>

              <P>(c) Persons entitled to notice of hearings, except those notified by complaint service under § 502.113, will be duly and timely informed of the nature of the proceeding, the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the proceeding is conducted, and the terms, substance, and issues involved, or the matters of fact and law asserted, as the case may be. Such notice will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> unless all persons subject thereto are named and either are served or otherwise have notice thereof in accordance with law.</P>
              <P>(d) In the order instituting a proceeding or in the notice of filing of complaint and assignment, the Commission must establish dates by which the initial decision and the final Commission decision will be issued. These dates may be extended by order of the Commission for good cause shown. [Rule 61.]</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing a complaint for formal adjudication.</E> (1) A person may file a sworn complaint alleging violation of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. 40101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(i) The name, street address, and email address of each complainant, and the name, address, and email address of each complainant's attorney or representative, the name, address, and, if known, email address of each person against whom complaint is made;</P>

              </P>
              <P>(iii) A clear and concise factual statement sufficient to inform each respondent with reasonable definiteness of the acts or practices alleged to be in violation of the law, and a statement showing that the complainant is entitled to relief;</P>

              <P>(4) <E T="03">Complaints seeking reparation; statute of limitations.</E> A complaint may seek reparation (money damages) for injury caused by violation of the Shipping Act of 1984. (See subpart O of this part.)</P>

              <P>(ii) Except under unusual circumstances and for good cause shown, reparation will not be awarded upon a complaint in which it is not specifically requested, nor upon a new complaint by or for the same complainant which is based upon a finding in the original proceeding.</P>
              <P>(iii) A complaint seeking reparation must be filed within three years after the claim accrues. Notification to the Commission that a complaint may or will be filed for the recovery of reparation will not constitute a filing within the applicable statutory period.</P>

              <P>(5) <E T="03">Oral hearing.</E> The complaint should designate whether an oral hearing is requested and the desired place for any oral hearing. The presiding officer will determine whether an oral hearing is necessary.</P>

For good cause shown, the presiding officer may extend the time for filing an answer.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Contents of answer.</E> The answer must be verified and must contain the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The name, address, and email address of each respondent, and the name, address, and email address of each respondent's attorney or representative;</P>
              <P>(ii) Admission or denial of each alleged violation of the Shipping Act;</P>
              <P>(iii) A clear and concise statement of each ground of defense and specific admission, denial, or explanation of facts alleged in the complaint, or, if respondent is without knowledge or information thereof, a statement to that effect; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Any affirmative defenses, including allegations of any additional facts on which the affirmative defenses are based.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Oral hearing.</E> The answer should designate whether an oral hearing is requested and the desired place for such hearing. The presiding officer will determine whether an oral hearing is necessary.</P>

The motion must be filed within 15 days of the pleading and must point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the order of the presiding officer is not obeyed within 10 days after service of the order or within such time as the presiding officer sets, the presiding officer may strike the pleading to which the motion was directed or issue any other appropriate order. If the motion is denied, the time for responding to the pleading must be extended to a date 10 days after service of the notice of denial. [Rule 67.]</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure for intervention.</E> (1) Upon request, the Commission will furnish a service list to any member of the public pursuant to part 503 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) The motion must:</P>
              <P>(i) Comply with all applicable provisions of subpart A of this part;</P>
              <P>(ii) Indicate the type of intervention sought;</P>

              <P>(iv) Describe the nature and extent of its proposed participation, including the use of discovery, presentation of evidence, and examination of witnesses;</P>
              <P>(v) State the basis for affirmative relief, if affirmative relief is sought; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Be served on existing parties by the person seeking intervention pursuant to subpart H of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) A response to a motion to intervene must be served and filed within 15 days after the date of service of the motion.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) <E T="03">Intervention of right.</E> The presiding officer or Commission must permit anyone to intervene who claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is subject of the proceeding, and is so situated that disposition of the proceeding may as a practical matter impair or impede the ability of such person to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Permissive intervention.</E> (i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The presiding officer or Commission may permit anyone to intervene who shows that a common issue of law or fact exists between such person's interest and the subject matter of the proceeding; that intervention would not unduly delay or broaden the scope of the proceeding, prejudice the adjudication of the rights, or be duplicative of the positions of any existing party; and that such person's participation may reasonably be expected to assist in the development of a sound record.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">By a government department, agency, or the Commission's Bureau of Enforcement.</E> The presiding officer or Commission may permit intervention by a Federal or State government department or agency or the Commission's Bureau of Enforcement upon a showing that its expertise is relevant to one or more issues involved in the proceeding and may assist in the consideration of those issues.</P>

              <P>(3) The timeliness of the motion will also be considered in determining whether a motion will be granted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and should be filed no later than 30 days after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the Commission's order instituting the proceeding or the notice of the filing of the complaint. Motions filed after that date must show good cause for the failure to file within the 30-day period.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of discovery by an intervenor.</E> (1) Absent good cause shown, an intervenor desiring to utilize the discovery procedures provided in subpart L must commence doing so no more than 15 days after its motion for leave to intervene has been granted.</P>

              <P>(2) The Commission or presiding officer may impose reasonable limitations <PRTPAGE P="40"/>on an intervenor's participation in order to:</P>
              <P>(i) Restrict irrelevant or duplicative discovery, evidence, or argument;</P>
              <P>(ii) Have common interests represented by a spokesperson; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Retain authority to determine priorities and control the course of the proceeding.</P>

              <P>(3) The use of discovery procedures by an intervenor whose motion was filed more than 30 days after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the Commission's order instituting the proceeding or the notice of the filing of the complaint will not be allowed if the presiding officer determines that the use of the discovery by the intervenor will unduly delay the proceeding.

              <P>(a) In any adjudication, an application or request for an order or ruling not otherwise specifically provided for in this part must be by motion. After the assignment of a presiding officer to a proceeding and before the issuance of his or her recommended or initial decision, all motions must be addressed to and ruled upon by the presiding officer unless the subject matter of the motion is beyond his or her authority, in which event the matter must be referred to the Commission.

              <P>(e) All written motions must state clearly and concisely the purpose of and the relief sought by the motion, the statutory or principal authority relied upon, and the facts claimed to constitute the grounds supporting the relief requested; and must conform with the requirements of subpart H of this part.</P>
              <P>(f) Any party may file and serve a response to any written motion, pleading, petition, application, etc., permitted under this part except as otherwise provided respecting answers (§ 502.62), briefs (§ 502.214), exceptions (§ 502.227), and reply to petitions for attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (§ 502.503(b)(1)).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Dispositive and non-dispositive motions defined.</E> For the purpose of these rules, <E T="03">dispositive motion</E> means a motion for decision on the pleadings; motion for summary decision or partial summary decision; motion to dismiss all or part of a proceeding or party to a proceeding; motion for involuntary dismissal; motion for initial decision on default; or any other motion for a final determination of all or part of a proceeding. All other motions, including all motions related to discovery, are non-dispositive motions. [Rule 69.]</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Voluntary dismissal.</E> (1) <E T="03">By the complainant.</E> When no settlement agreement is involved, the complainant may dismiss an action without an order from the presiding officer by filing a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves either an answer, a motion to dismiss, or a motion for summary decision. Unless the notice or stipulation states otherwise, the dismissal is without prejudice.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">By stipulation of the parties.</E> The parties may dismiss an action at any point without an order from the presiding officer by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared. In the stipulation the parties must certify that no settlement on the merits was reached. Unless the stipulation states otherwise, the dismissal is without prejudice.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">By order of the presiding officer.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, an action may be dismissed at the complainant's request only by order of the presiding officer, on terms the presiding officer considers proper. If the motion is based on a settlement by the parties, the settlement agreement must be submitted with the motion for determination as to whether the settlement appears to violate any law or policy and to ensure the settlement is free of fraud, duress, undue influence, mistake, or other defects which might make it unapprovable. Unless the order states otherwise, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Involuntary dismissal; effect.</E> If the complainant fails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or an order in the proceeding, a respondent may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it, or the presiding officer, after notice to the parties, may dismiss the proceeding on its own motion. Unless the dismissal order states otherwise, a dismissal under this subpart, except one for lack of jurisdiction or failure to join a party, operates as an adjudication on the merits.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Dismissing a counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim.</E> This rule applies to dismissals of any counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim.</P>

A petition for exemption must state the particular requirement of the Shipping Act of 1984 for which exemption is sought.

              <P>(e) No additional submissions will be permitted unless ordered or requested by the Commission or the presiding officer. If discovery or evidentiary hearing on the petition is deemed necessary by the parties, such must be requested in the petition or responses. Requests must state in detail the facts to be developed, their relevance to the issues, and why discovery or hearing procedures are necessary to develop such facts.</P>

              <P>(f)(1) A notice of filing of any petition which meets the requirements of this section must be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The notice will indicate the time for filing of responses to the petition. If the controversy or uncertainty is one of general public interest, and not limited to specifically named persons, opportunity for response will be given to all interested persons including the Commission's Bureau of Enforcement.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of petitions involving a matter limited to specifically named persons, participation by persons not named therein will be permitted only upon grant of intervention by the Commission pursuant to § 502.68.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Scope of discovery and limits.</E> (1) Unless otherwise limited by the presiding officer, or as otherwise provided in this subpart, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense—including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any documents or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons who know of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the presiding officer may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. Relevant information need not be admissible at hearing if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Limitations on frequency and extent.</E> (i) <E T="03">Specific limitations on electronically stored information.</E> A party need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the party identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective order, the party from whom discovery is sought must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the presiding officer may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause. The presiding officer may specify conditions for the discovery.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">When required.</E> On motion or on its own, the presiding officer may limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed by these rules if the presiding officer determines that:</P>

              <P>(A) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;<PRTPAGE P="50"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action; or</P>
              <P>(C) The burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the proceeding, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the action, and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Scope of discovery and limits—experts.</E> (1) A party may depose any person who has been identified as an expert whose opinions may be presented in a proceeding. If a report is required of the witness, the deposition may be conducted only after the report is provided.</P>
              <P>(2) Drafts of any report or disclosure required by these rules are not discoverable regardless of the form in which the draft is recorded.</P>
              <P>(3) Communications between the party's attorney and any expert witness required to provide a report are not discoverable regardless of the form of communications, except to the extent that the communications relate to compensation for the expert's study or testimony; identify facts or data that the party's attorney provided and that the expert considered in forming the opinions to be expressed; or identify assumptions that the party's attorney provided and that the expert relied on in forming the opinions to be expressed.</P>
              <P>(4) A party may not by interrogatories or deposition discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or to prepare for a proceeding and who is not expected to be presented as a witness; provided, however, that the presiding officer may permit such discovery and may impose such conditions as deemed appropriate upon a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Completion of discovery.</E> Discovery must be completed within 150 days of the service of a respondent's answer to the complaint or Order of Investigation and Hearing.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Duty of the parties to confer.</E> In all proceedings in which the procedures of this subpart are used, it is the duty of the parties to confer within 15 days after receipt of a respondent's answer to a complaint or Order of Investigation and Hearing in order to: establish a schedule for the completion of discovery, including disclosures and discovery related to experts, within the 150-day period prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section; resolve to the fullest extent possible disputes relating to discovery matters; and expedite, limit, or eliminate discovery by use of admissions, stipulations and other techniques. The parties must submit the schedule to the presiding officer not later than 5 days after the conference. Nothing in this rule should be construed to preclude the parties from conducting discovery and conferring at an earlier date.</P>
              <P>(i)(1) <E T="03">Conferences by order of the presiding officer.</E> The presiding officer may at any time order the parties or their attorneys to participate in a conference at which the presiding officer may direct the proper use of the procedures of this subpart or make such orders as may be necessary to resolve disputes with respect to discovery and to prevent delay or undue inconvenience.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Resolution of disputes.</E> After making every reasonable effort to resolve discovery disputes, a party may request a conference or rulings from the presiding officer on such disputes. If necessary to prevent undue delay or otherwise facilitate conclusion of the proceeding, the presiding officer may order a hearing to commence before the completion of discovery.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Protective orders.</E> (1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A party or any person from whom discovery is sought may move for a protective order. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the dispute without Commission or presiding officer action. The Commission or presiding officer may, for good cause, issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or <PRTPAGE P="51"/>undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Forbidding the disclosure or discovery;</P>
              <P>(ii) Specifying terms, including time and place, for the disclosure or discovery;</P>
              <P>(iii) Prescribing a discovery method other than the one selected by the party seeking discovery;</P>
              <P>(iv) Forbidding inquiry into certain matters, or limiting the scope of disclosure or discovery to certain matters;</P>
              <P>(v) Designating the persons who may be present while the discovery is conducted;</P>
              <P>(vi) Requiring that a deposition be sealed and opened only on Commission or presiding officer order;</P>
              <P>(vii) Requiring that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a specified way; or</P>
              <P>(viii) Requiring that the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information in sealed envelopes, to be opened as the Commission or presiding officer directs.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Ordering discovery.</E> If a motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the Commission or presiding officer may, on just terms, order that any party or person provide or permit discovery.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Supplementing responses.</E> A party who has made a disclosure under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, or who has responded to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission, must supplement or correct its disclosure or response:</P>
              <P>(1) In a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in written communication; or</P>
              <P>(2) As ordered by the presiding officer.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Stipulations.</E> Unless the presiding officer orders otherwise, the parties may stipulate that other procedures governing or limiting discovery be modified, but a stipulation extending the time for any form of discovery must have presiding officer's approval if it would interfere with the time set for completing discovery, for adjudicating a motion, or for hearing.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">When a deposition may be taken.</E> (1) <E T="03">Without leave.</E> A party may, by oral questions, depose any person, including a party, without leave of the presiding officer except as provided in § 502.143(a)(2). The deponent's attendance may be compelled by subpoena under subpart I of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">With leave.</E> A party must obtain leave of the presiding officer, if the parties have not stipulated to the deposition and:</P>
              <P>(i) The deposition would result in more than 20 depositions being taken under this rule or § 502.144 by any party; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The deponent has already been deposed in the case.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of the deposition; other formal requirements.</E> (1) <E T="03">Notice in general.</E> A party who wants to depose a person by oral questions must give reasonable written notice to every other party. The notice must state the time and place of the deposition and, if known, the deponent's name and address. If the name is unknown, the notice must provide a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Producing documents.</E> If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the deponent, the materials designated for production, as set out in the subpoena, must be listed in the notice or in an attachment. The notice to a party deponent may be accompanied by a request under § 502.146 to produce documents and tangible things at the deposition.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Method of recording.</E> (i) <E T="03">Method stated in the notice.</E> The party who notices the deposition must state in the notice the method for recording the testimony. Unless the presiding officer orders otherwise, testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. The noticing party bears the recording costs. Any party may arrange to transcribe a deposition.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Additional method.</E> With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may designate another method for recording the testimony in addition to that specified in the original notice. That party bears the expense of the additional record or transcript unless the presiding officer orders otherwise.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">By remote means.</E> The parties may stipulate, or the presiding officer may on motion order, that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote means.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Officer's duties.</E> (i) <E T="03">Before the deposition.</E> Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, a deposition must be conducted before an officer appointed or designated under § 502.142. The officer must begin the deposition with an on-the-record statement that includes:</P>
              <P>(A) The officer's name and business address;</P>
              <P>(B) The date, time, and place of the deposition;</P>
              <P>(C) The deponent's name;</P>
              <P>(D) The officer's administration of the oath or affirmation to the deponent; and</P>
              <P>(E) The identity of all persons present.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Conducting the deposition; avoiding distortion.</E> If the deposition is recorded nonstenographically, the officer must repeat the items in § 502.143(b)(5)(i)(A) through (C) at the beginning of each unit of the recording medium. The deponent's and attorneys' appearance or demeanor must not be distorted through recording techniques.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">After the deposition.</E> At the end of a deposition, the officer must state on the record that the deposition is complete and must set out any stipulations made by the attorneys about custody of the transcript or recording and of <PRTPAGE P="53"/>the exhibits, or about any other pertinent matters.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Notice or subpoena directed to an organization.</E> In its notice or subpoena, a party may name as the deponent a public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, a governmental agency, or other entity and must describe with reasonable particularity the matters for examination. The named organization must then designate one or more officers, directors, or managing representatives, or designate other persons who consent to testify on its behalf; and it may set out the matters on which each person designated will testify. A subpoena must advise a nonparty organization of its duty to make this designation. The persons designated must testify about information known or reasonably available to the organization. This paragraph (6) does not preclude a deposition by any other procedure allowed by these rules.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Examination and cross-examination; record of the examination; objections; written questions.</E> (1) <E T="03">Examination and cross-examination.</E> The examination and cross-examination of a deponent proceed as they would at hearing under the provisions of § 502.202. After putting the deponent under oath or affirmation, the officer must record the testimony by the method designated under § 502.143(b)(3). The testimony must be recorded by the officer personally or by a person acting in the presence and under the direction of the officer.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Objections.</E> An objection at the time of the examination, whether to evidence, to a party's conduct, to the officer's qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition, must be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection. An objection must be stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the presiding officer, or to present a motion under § 502.143(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Participating through written questions.</E> Instead of participating in the oral examination, a party may serve written questions in a sealed envelope on the party noticing the deposition, who must deliver them to the officer. The officer must ask the deponent those questions and record the answers verbatim.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Duration; sanction; motion to terminate or limit.</E> (1) <E T="03">Duration.</E> Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the presiding officer, a deposition is limited to 1 day of 7 hours. The presiding officer must allow additional time consistent with § 502.141(e) if needed to fairly examine the deponent or if the deponent, another person, or any other circumstance impedes or delays the examination.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Motion to terminate or limit.</E> (i) <E T="03">Grounds.</E> At any time during a deposition, the deponent or a party may move to terminate or limit it on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party. The motion may be filed with the presiding officer. If the objecting deponent or party so demands, the deposition must be suspended for the time necessary to obtain an order.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Order.</E> The presiding officer may order that the deposition be terminated or may limit its scope and manner as provided in § 502.141(j). If terminated, the deposition may be resumed only by order of the Commission or presiding officer.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Review by the witness; changes.</E> (1) <E T="03">Review; statement of changes.</E> On request by the deponent or a party before the deposition is completed, the deponent must be allowed 15 days after being notified by the officer that the transcript or recording is available in which:</P>
              <P>(i) To review the transcript or recording; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If there are changes in form or substance, to sign a statement listing the changes and the reasons for making them.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Changes indicated in the officer's certificate.</E> The officer must note in the certificate prescribed by § 502.143(f)(1) whether a review was requested and, if so, must attach any changes the deponent makes during the 15-day period.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Certification and delivery; exhibits; copies of the transcript or recording.</E> (1) <E T="03">Certification and delivery.</E> The officer <PRTPAGE P="54"/>must certify in writing that the witness was duly sworn and that the deposition, transcript or recording accurately records the witness's testimony. The certificate must accompany the record of the deposition. Unless the presiding officer orders otherwise, the officer must seal the deposition in an envelope or package bearing the title of the action and marked “Deposition of [witness's name]” and must promptly send it to the attorney who arranged for the transcript or recording. The attorney must store it under conditions that will protect it against loss, destruction, tampering, or deterioration.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Documents and tangible things.</E> (i) <E T="03">Originals and copies.</E> Documents and tangible things produced for inspection during a deposition must, on a party's request, be marked for identification and attached to the deposition. Any party may inspect and copy them. But if the person who produced them wants to keep the originals, the person may:</P>
              <P>(A) Offer copies to be marked, attached to the deposition, and then used as originals, after giving all parties a fair opportunity to verify the copies by comparing them with the originals; or</P>
              <P>(B) Give all parties a fair opportunity to inspect and copy the originals after they are marked, in which event the originals may be used as if attached to the deposition.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Order regarding the originals.</E> Any party may move for an order that the originals be attached to the deposition pending final disposition of the case.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Copies of the transcript or recording.</E> Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the presiding officer, the officer must retain the stenographic notes of a deposition taken stenographically or a copy of the recording of a deposition taken by another method. When paid reasonable charges, the officer must furnish a copy of the transcript or recording to any party or the deponent. [Rule 203.]</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope and procedure.</E> (1) <E T="03">Scope.</E> A party may serve on any other party a written request to admit, for the purposes of the pending action only, the truth of any nonprivileged relevant matters relating to facts, the application of law to fact, or opinions about either, and the genuineness of any described documents.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Form; copies of documents.</E> Each matter must be separately stated. A request to admit the genuineness of a document must be accompanied by a copy of the document unless it is, or has been, otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Time to respond; effect of failure to respond.</E> A matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its attorney. A shorter or longer time for responding may be stipulated to as provided in § 502.141(l) of this subpart or be ordered by the presiding officer.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Answer.</E> If a matter is not admitted, the answer must specifically deny it or state in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny it. A denial must fairly respond to the substance of the matter; and when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of a matter, the answer must specify the part admitted and qualify or deny the rest. The answering party may assert lack of knowledge or information as a reason for failing to admit or deny only if the party states that it has made reasonable inquiry and that the information it knows or can readily obtain is <PRTPAGE P="57"/>insufficient to enable it to admit or deny.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Objections.</E> The grounds for objecting to a request must be stated. A party may not object solely on the ground that the request presents a genuine issue for adjudication.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Motion regarding the sufficiency of an answer or objection.</E> The requesting party may move for a determination of the sufficiency of an answer or objection. Unless the presiding officer finds an objection justified, the presiding officer must order that an answer be served. On finding that an answer does not comply with this rule, the presiding officer may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The presiding officer may defer a decision until a prehearing conference or a specified time prior to hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of admission; withdrawal or amendment of admission.</E> A matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the presiding officer, on motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended. The presiding officer may permit withdrawal or amendment if it would promote the presentation of the merits of the action and if the presiding officer is not persuaded that it would prejudice the requesting party in maintaining or defending the action on the merits. An admission under this rule is not an admission for any other purpose and cannot be used against the party in any other proceeding. [Rule 207.]</P>

              <P>(i) The party was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or had reasonable notice of it;</P>
              <P>(ii) It is used to the extent it would be admissible if the deponent were present and testifying; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The use is allowed by § 502.149(a)(2) through (7).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Impeachment and other uses.</E> Any party may use a deposition to contradict or impeach the testimony given by the deponent as a witness, or for any other purpose allowed by § 502.204 of subpart L of this part.</P>

              <P>(4) <E T="03">Unavailable witness.</E> A party may use for any purpose the deposition of a <PRTPAGE P="58"/>witness, whether or not a party, if the Commission or presiding officer finds:</P>
              <P>(i) That the witness is dead;</P>
              <P>(ii) That the witness cannot attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment;</P>
              <P>(iii) That the party offering the deposition could not procure the witness's attendance by subpoena; or</P>
              <P>(iv) On motion and notice, that exceptional circumstances make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of live testimony at a hearing, to permit the deposition to be used.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Using part of a deposition.</E> If a party offers in evidence only part of a deposition, an adverse party may require the offeror to introduce other parts that in fairness should be considered with the part introduced, and any party may itself introduce any other parts.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Substituting a party.</E> Substituting a party does not affect the right to use a deposition previously taken.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Deposition taken in an earlier action.</E> A deposition lawfully taken and, if required, filed in any Federal or State court action may be used in a later action involving the same subject matter between the same parties, or their representatives or successors in interest, to the same extent as if taken in the later action. A deposition previously taken may also be used as allowed by § 502.204 of subpart L of this part.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Form of presentation.</E> Unless the presiding officer orders otherwise, a party must provide a transcript of any deposition testimony the party offers, but may provide the presiding officer with the testimony in nontranscript form as well.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Waiver of objections.</E> (1) <E T="03">To the notice.</E> An objection to an error or irregularity in a deposition notice is waived unless promptly served in writing on the party giving the notice.</P>

              <P>(i) Before the deposition begins; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Promptly after the basis for disqualification becomes known or, with reasonable diligence, could have been known.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">To the taking of the deposition.</E> (i) <E T="03">Objection to competence, relevance, or materiality.</E> An objection to a deponent's competence, or to the competence, relevance, or materiality of testimony, is not waived by a failure to make the objection before or during the deposition, unless the ground for it might have been corrected at that time.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Objection to an error or irregularity.</E> An objection to an error or irregularity at an oral examination is waived if:</P>
              <P>(A) It relates to the manner of taking the deposition, the form of a question or answer, the oath or affirmation, a party's conduct, or other matters that might have been corrected at that time; and</P>
              <P>(B) It is not timely made during the deposition.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Objection to a written question.</E> An objection to the form of a written question under § 502.144 of this subpart is waived if not served in writing on the party submitting the question within the time for serving responsive questions or, if the question is a recross-question, within 7 days after being served with it.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">To completing and returning the deposition.</E> An objection to how the officer transcribed the testimony, or prepared, signed, certified, sealed, endorsed, sent, or otherwise dealt with the deposition, is waived unless a motion to suppress is made promptly after the error or irregularity becomes known or, with reasonable diligence, could have been known.

A motion must include a certification that the moving party has conferred in good faith or attempted to confer with the disobedient party in an effort to obtain compliance without the necessity of a motion. An order of the presiding officer may:</P>
              <P>(1) Direct that the matters included in the order or any other designated facts must be taken to be established for the purposes of the action as the party making the motion claims;</P>

              <P>(3) Strike pleadings in whole or in part; staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed; or dismissing the action or proceeding or any party thereto, or rendering a decision by default against the disobedient party.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Enforcement of orders and subpoenas.</E> In the event of refusal to obey an order or failure to comply with a subpoena, the Attorney General at the request of the Commission, or any party injured thereby may seek enforcement by a United States district court having jurisdiction over the parties. Any action with respect to enforcement of subpoenas or orders relating to depositions, written interrogatories, or other discovery matters must be taken within 20 days of the date of refusal to obey or failure to comply. A private party must advise the Commission 5 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) before applying to the court of its intent to seek enforcement of such subpoenas and discovery orders.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Prior to any hearing, the Commission or presiding officer may direct all interested parties, by written notice, to attend one or more prehearing conferences for the purpose of considering any settlement under § 502.91, formulating the issues in the proceeding, and determining other matters to aid in its disposition. In addition to any offers of settlement or proposals of adjustment, the following may be considered:</P>
              <P>(i) Simplification of the issues;</P>
              <P>(ii) The necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings;</P>
              <P>(iii) The possibility of obtaining admissions of fact and of documents that will avoid unnecessary proof;</P>
              <P>(iv) Limitation of the number of witnesses;</P>
              <P>(v) The procedure to be used at the hearing;</P>

              <P>(viii) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to the hearing, the presiding officer may require exchange of exhibits and any other material that may expedite the hearing. The presiding officer will assume the responsibility of accomplishing the purposes of the notice of prehearing conference so far as this may be possible without prejudice to the rights of any party.</P>
              <P>(3) The presiding officer will rule upon all matters presented for decision, orally upon the record when feasible, or by subsequent ruling in writing. If a party determines that a ruling made orally does not cover fully the issue presented, or is unclear, such party may file a motion requesting a further ruling within ten (10) days after receipt of the transcript.</P>
              <P>(b) In any proceeding under the rules in this part, the presiding officer hold an informal conference prior to the taking of testimony, or may recess the hearing for such a conference, with a view to carrying out the purposes of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) At any prehearing conference, consideration may be given to whether the use of alternative dispute resolution would be appropriate or useful for the disposition of the proceeding whether or not there has been previous consideration of such use. [Rule 209.]</P>

              <P>(a) Unless a waiver is granted by the presiding officer, it is the duty of all parties to a proceeding to prepare a statement or statements at a time and in the manner to be established by the presiding officer provided that there has been reasonable opportunity for <PRTPAGE P="62"/>discovery. To the extent possible, joint statements should be prepared.</P>
              <P>(b) The prehearing statement must state the name of the party or parties on whose behalf it is presented and briefly set forth the following matters, unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer:</P>
              <P>(1) Issues involved in the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(2) Facts stipulated pursuant to the procedures together with a statement that the party or parties have communicated or conferred in a good faith effort to reach stipulation to the fullest extent possible.</P>
              <P>(3) Facts in dispute.</P>
              <P>(4) Witnesses and exhibits by which disputed facts will be litigated.</P>
              <P>(5) A brief statement of applicable law.</P>
              <P>(6) The conclusion to be drawn.</P>
              <P>(7) Suggested time and location of hearing and estimated time required for presentation of the party's or parties' case.</P>
              <P>(8) Any appropriate comments, suggestions, or information which might assist the parties in preparing for the hearing or otherwise aid in the disposition of the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(c) The presiding officer may, for good cause shown, permit a party to introduce facts or argue points of law outside the scope of the facts and law outlined in the prehearing statement. Failure to file a prehearing statement, unless waiver has been granted by the presiding officer, may result in dismissal of a party from the proceeding, dismissal of a complaint, judgment against respondents, or imposition of such other sanctions as may be appropriate under the circumstances.</P>
              <P>(d) Following the submission of prehearing statements, the presiding officer may, upon motion or otherwise, convene a prehearing conference for the purpose of further narrowing issues and limiting the scope of the hearing if, in his or her opinion, the prehearing statements indicate lack of dispute of material fact not previously acknowledged by the parties or lack of legitimate need for cross-examination and is authorized to issue appropriate orders consistent with the purposes stated in this section.

              <P>A formal exception to a ruling or order is unnecessary. When the ruling or order is requested or made, the party doing so need only state the action that it wants the presiding officer to take or that it objects to, along with the grounds for the request or objection.

              <P>(a) The Commission will designate the official reporter for all hearings. The official transcript of testimony taken, together with any exhibits and any briefs or memoranda of law filed therewith, will be filed with the Commission. Transcripts of testimony will be available in any proceeding under the rules in this part, at actual cost of duplication.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) Where the Commission does not request daily copy service, any party requesting such service must bear the incremental cost of transcription above the regular copy transcription cost borne by the Commission, in addition to the actual cost of duplication. Where the requesting party applies for and demonstrates that the furnishing of daily copy is indispensable to the protection of a vital right or interest <PRTPAGE P="63"/>in achieving a fair hearing, the presiding officer in the proceeding in which the application is made will order that daily copy service be provided the requesting party at the actual cost of duplication, with the full cost of transcription being borne by the Commission.</P>

              <P>(2) In the event a request for daily copy is denied by the presiding officer, the requesting party, in order to obtain daily copy, must pay the cost of transcription over and above that borne by the Commission, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the incremental cost between that paid by the Commission when it requests regular copy and when it requests daily copy. The decision of the presiding officer in this situation is interpreted as falling within the scope of the functions and powers of the presiding officer, as defined in § 502.25(a).</P>
              <P>(c) Motions made at the hearing to correct the transcript will be acted upon by the presiding officer. Motions made after an oral hearing to correct the record must be filed with the presiding officer within twenty-five (25) days after the last day of hearing or any session thereof, unless otherwise directed by the presiding officer, and must be served on all parties. If no objections are received within ten (10) days after date of service, the transcript will, upon approval of the presiding officer, be changed to reflect such corrections. If objections are received, the motion will be acted upon with due consideration of the stenographic record of the hearing. [Rule 213.]</P>

              <SUBJECT>Oral argument.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Commission may hear oral argument either on its own motion or upon the written request of a party. If oral argument before the Commission is desired on exceptions to an initial or recommended decision, or on a motion, petition, or application, a request therefor shall be made in writing. Any party may make such a request irrespective of its filing exceptions under § 502.227. If a brief on exceptions is filed, the request for oral argument shall be incorporated in such brief. Requests for oral argument on any motion, petition, or application shall be made in the motion, petition, or application, or in the reply thereto. If the Commission determines to hear oral argument, a notice will be issued setting forth the order of presentation and the amount of time allotted to each party.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Requests for oral argument will be granted or denied in the discretion of the Commission.</P>
              <P>(2) Parties requesting oral argument shall set forth the specific issues they propose to address at oral argument.</P>
              <P>(c) Those who appear before the Commission for oral argument shall confine their argument to points of controlling importance raised on exceptions or replies thereto. Where the facts of a case are adequately and accurately dealt with in the initial or recommended decision, parties should, as far as possible, address themselves in argument to the conclusions.</P>

              <P>(d) Effort should be made by parties taking the same position to agree in advance of the argument upon those persons who are to present their side of the case, and the names of such persons and the amount of time requested should be received by the Commission not later than ten (10) days before the date set for the argument. The fewer <PRTPAGE P="67"/>the number of persons making the argument the more effectively can the parties' interests be presented in the time allotted. [Rule 241.]</P>

              <P>If many shipments or points of origin or destination are involved in a proceeding in which reparation is sought (See § 502.63), the Commission will determine in its decision the issues as to violations, injury to complainant, and right to reparation. If complainant is found entitled to reparation, the parties thereafter will be given an opportunity to agree or make proof respecting the shipments and pecuniary amount of reparation due before the order of the Commission awarding reparation is entered. In such cases, freight bills and other exhibits bearing on the details of all shipments, and the amount of reparation on each, need not be produced at the original hearing unless called for or needed to develop other pertinent facts.

              <P>When the Commission finds that reparation is due, but that the amount cannot be ascertained upon the record before it, the complainant shall immediately prepare a statement in accordance with the approved reparation statement in Exhibit No. 1 to this subpart, showing details of the shipments on which reparation is claimed. This statement shall not include any shipments not covered by the findings of the Commission. Complainant shall forward the statement, together with the paid freight bills on the shipments, or true copies thereof, to the respondent or other person who collected the charges for checking and certification as to accuracy. Statements so prepared and certified shall be filed with the Commission for consideration in determining the amount of reparation due. Disputes concerning the accuracy of amounts may be assigned for conference by the Commission, or in its discretion referred for further hearing. [Rule 252.]</P>

              <P>Except as to applications for refund or waiver of freight charges under § 502.271 and claims which are settled by agreement of the parties, and absent fraud or misconduct of a party, interest granted on awards of reparation in complaint proceedings instituted under the Shipping Act of 1984 will accrue from the date of injury to the date specified in the Commission order awarding reparation. Compounding will be daily from the date of injury to the date specified in the Commission order awarding reparation. Normally, the date specified within which payment must be made will be fifteen (15) days subsequent to the date of service of the Commission order. Interest shall be computed on the basis of the average monthly secondary market rate on six-month U.S. Treasury bills commencing with the rate for the month that the injury occurred and concluding with the latest available monthly U.S. Treasury bill rate at the date of the Commission order awarding reparation. <PRTPAGE P="68"/>The monthly secondary market rates on six-month U.S. Treasury bills for the reparation period will be summed up and divided by the number of months for which interest rates are available in the reparation period to determine the average interest rate applicable during the period.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In any complaint proceeding brought under 46 U.S.C. 41301 (sections 11(a)-(b) of the Shipping Act of 1984), the Commission may, upon petition, award the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E>
              </P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Attorney fees</E> means the fair market value of the services of any person permitted to appear and practice before the Commission in accordance with subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Decision</E> means:</P>
              <P>(1) An initial decision or dismissal order issued by an administrative law judge;</P>
              <P>(2) A final decision issued by a small claims officer; or</P>
              <P>(3) A final decision issued by the Commission.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Filing petitions for attorney fees.</E> (1) In order to recover attorney fees, the prevailing party must file a petition within 30 days after a decision becomes final. For purposes of this section, a decision is considered final when the time for seeking judicial review has expired or when a court appeal has terminated.</P>
              <P>(2) The prevailing party must file the petition with either:</P>
              <P>(i) The administrative law judge or small claims officer, if that official's decision became administratively final under § 502.227(a)(3), § 502.227(c), § 502.304(g), or § 502.318(a); or</P>
              <P>(ii) The Commission, if the Commission reviewed the decision of the administrative law judge or small claims officer under § 502.227, § 502.304, or § 502.318.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Content of petitions.</E> (1) The petition must:</P>
              <P>(i) Explain why attorney fees should be awarded in the proceeding;</P>
              <P>(ii) Specify the number of hours claimed by each person representing the prevailing party at each identifiable stage of the proceeding; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Include supporting evidence of the reasonableness of the hours claimed and the customary rates charged by attorneys and associated legal representatives in the community where the person practices.</P>
              <P>(2) The petition may request additional compensation, but any such request must be supported by evidence that the customary rates for the hours reasonably expended on the case would result in an unreasonably low fee award.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Replies to petitions.</E> The opposing party may file a reply to the petition within 20 days of the service date of the petition. The reply may address the reasonableness of any aspect of the prevailing party's claim and may suggest adjustments to the claim under the criteria stated in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Rulings on petitions.</E> (1) Upon consideration of a petition and any reply thereto, the Commission, administrative law judge, or small claims officer will issue an order granting or denying the petition.</P>
              <P>(i) If the order awards the prevailing party attorney fees, the order will state the total amount of attorney fees awarded, specify the compensable hours and appropriate rate of compensation, and explain the basis for any additional adjustments.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the order denies the prevailing party attorney fees, the order will explain the reasons for the denial.</P>
              <P>(2) The Commission, administrative law judge, or small claims officer may adopt a stipulated settlement of attorney fees.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Timing of rulings.</E> An order granting or denying a petition for attorney fees will be served within 60 days of the date of the filing of the reply to the petition or expiration of the reply period, except that in cases involving a substantial dispute of facts critical to the determination of an award, the Commission, administrative law judge, or small claims officer may hold a hearing on such issues and extend the time for issuing an order by an additional 30 days.<PRTPAGE P="69"/>
              </P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Appealing rulings by administrative law judge or small claims officer.</E> The relevant rules governing appeal and Commission review of decisions by administrative law judges (§§ 502.227; 502.318) and small claims officers (§ 502.304) apply to orders issued by those officers under this section.

              <P>(a) A sworn claim under this subpart shall be filed in the form prescribed in Exhibit No. 1 to this subpart. Three (3) copies of this claim must be filed, together with the same number of copies of such supporting documents as may be deemed necessary to establish the claim. Copies of tariff pages need not be filed; reference to such tariffs or to pertinent parts thereof will be sufficient. Supporting documents may consist of affidavits, correspondence, bills of lading, paid freight bills, export declarations, dock or wharf receipts, or of such other documents as, in the judgment of the claimant, tend to establish the claim. The Small Claims Officer may, if deemed necessary, request additional documents or information from claimants. Claimant may attach a memorandum, brief or other document containing discussion, argument, or legal authority in support of its claim. If a claim filed under this subpart involves any shipment which has been the subject of a previous claim filed with the Commission, formally or informally, full reference to such previous claim must be given.</P>
              <P>(b) Claims under this subpart shall be addressed to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573. Such claims must be accompanied by remittance of a $106 filing fee.</P>
              <P>(c) Each claim under this subpart will be acknowledged with a reference to the Informal Docket Number assigned. The number shall consist of a numeral(s) followed by capital “I” in parentheses. All further correspondence pertaining to such claims must refer to the assigned Informal Docket Number. If the documents filed fail to establish a claim for which relief may be granted, the parties affected will be so notified in writing. The claimant may thereafter, but only if the period of limitation has not run, resubmit its claim with such additional proof as may be necessary to establish the claim. In the event a complaint has been amended because it failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, it will be considered as a new complaint.</P>
              <P>(d) A copy of each claim filed under this subpart, with attachments, shall be served by the Secretary on the respondent named in the claim.</P>
              <P>(e) Within twenty-five (25) days from the date of service of the claim, the respondent shall serve upon the claimant and file with the Commission its response to the claim, together with an indication, in the form prescribed in Exhibit No. 2 to this subpart, as to whether the informal procedure provided in this subpart is consented to. Failure of the respondent to indicate refusal or consent in its response will be conclusively deemed to indicate such consent. The response shall consist of documents, arguments, legal authorities, or precedents, or any other matters considered by the respondent to be a defense to the claim. The Small Claims Officer may request the respondent to furnish such further documents or information as deemed necessary, or he or she may require the claimant to reply to the defenses raised by the respondent.</P>
              <P>(f) If the respondent refuses to consent to the claim being informally adjudicated pursuant to this subpart, the claim will be considered a complaint under § 502.311 and will be adjudicated under subpart T of this part.</P>

              <P>(g) Both parties shall promptly be served with the Small Claims Officer's decision which shall state the basis upon which the decision was made. Where appropriate, the Small Claims Officer may require that the respondent publish notice in its tariff of the substance of the decision. This decision shall be final, unless, within thirty (30) days from the date of service of the decision, the Commission exercises its discretionary right to review the decision. The Commission shall not, on its own initiative, review any decision or order of dismissal unless such review is <PRTPAGE P="76"/>requested by an individual Commissioner. Any such request must be transmitted to the Secretary within thirty (30) days after date of service of the decision or order. Such request shall be sufficient to bring the matter before the Commission for review.</P>
              <P>(h) Within thirty (30) days after service of a final decision by a Small Claims Officer, any party may file a petition for reconsideration. Such petition shall be directed to the Small Claims Officer and shall act as a stay of the review period prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section. A petition will be subject to summary rejection unless it: (1) Specifies that there has been a change in material fact or in applicable law, which change has occurred after issuance of the decision or order; (2) identifies a substantive error in material fact contained in the decision or order; (3) addresses a material matter in the Small Claims Officer's decision upon which the petitioner has not previously had the opportunity to comment. Petitions which merely elaborate upon or repeat arguments made prior to the decision or order will not be received. Upon issuance of a decision or order on reconsideration by the Small Claims Officer, the review period prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section will recommence. [Rule 304.]</P>

              <P>It is the policy of the Federal Maritime Commission to use alternative means of dispute resolution to the fullest extent compatible with the law and the agency's mission and resources. The Commission will consider using ADR in all areas including workplace <PRTPAGE P="80"/>issues, formal and informal adjudication, issuance of regulations, enforcement and compliance, issuing and revoking licenses and permits, contract award and administration, litigation brought by or against the Commission, and other interactions with the public and the regulated community. The Commission will provide learning and development opportunities for its employees to develop their ability to use conflict resolution skills, instill knowledge of the theory and practice of ADR, and to facilitate appropriate use of ADR. To this end, all parties to matters under this part are required to consider use of a wide range of alternative means to resolve disputes at an early stage. Parties are encouraged to pursue use of alternative means through the Commission's Office of Consumer Affairs and Dispute Resolution Services in lieu of or prior to initiating a Commission proceeding. All employees and persons who interact with the Commission are encouraged to identify opportunities for collaborative, consensual approaches to dispute resolution or rulemaking.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Dispute resolution proceeding</E> means any process in which an alternative means of dispute resolution is used to resolve an issue in controversy in which a neutral is appointed and specified parties participate;</P>

              <P>(b) The Commission will consider not using a dispute resolution proceeding if—</P>
              <P>(1) A definitive or authoritative resolution of the matter is required for precedential value, and such a proceeding is not likely to be accepted generally as an authoritative precedent;</P>
              <P>(2) The matter involves or may bear upon significant questions of Government policy that require additional procedures before a final resolution may be made, and such a proceeding would not likely serve to develop a recommended policy for the agency;</P>
              <P>(3) Maintaining established policies is of special importance, so that variations among individual decisions are not increased and such a proceeding would not likely reach consistent results among individual decisions;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Confidentiality.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, a neutral in a dispute resolution proceeding shall not voluntarily disclose or through discovery or compulsory process be required to disclose any dispute resolution communication or any communication provided in confidence to the neutral, unless—</P>
              <P>(1) All parties to the dispute resolution proceeding and the neutral consent in writing, and, if the dispute resolution communication was provided by a nonparty participant, that participant also consents in writing;</P>
              <P>(2) The dispute resolution communication has already been made public;</P>
              <P>(3) The dispute resolution communication is required by statute to be made public, but a neutral should make such communication public only if no other person is reasonably available to disclose the communication; or</P>
              <P>(4) A court determines that such testimony or disclosure is necessary to—</P>
              <P>(i) Prevent a manifest injustice;</P>
              <P>(ii) Help establish a violation of law; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Prevent harm to the public health or safety, of sufficient magnitude in the particular case to outweigh the integrity of dispute resolution proceedings in general by reducing the confidence of parties in future cases that their communications will remain confidential.</P>
              <P>(b) A party to a dispute resolution proceeding shall not voluntarily disclose or through discovery or compulsory process be required to disclose any dispute resolution communication, unless—</P>
              <P>(1) The communication was prepared by the party seeking disclosure;</P>
              <P>(2) All parties to the dispute resolution proceeding consent in writing;</P>
              <P>(3) The dispute resolution communication has already been made public;</P>
              <P>(4) The dispute resolution communication is required by statute to be made public;</P>

              <P>(ii) Help establish a violation of law; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Prevent harm to the public health and safety, of sufficient magnitude in the particular case to outweigh the integrity of dispute resolution proceedings in general by reducing the confidence of parties in future cases that their communications will remain confidential;</P>

              <P>(6) The dispute resolution communication is relevant to determining the existence or meaning of an agreement or award that resulted from the dispute <PRTPAGE P="82"/>resolution proceeding or to the enforcement of such an agreement or award; or</P>
              <P>(7) Except for dispute resolution communications generated by the neutral, the dispute resolution communication was provided to or was available to all parties to the dispute resolution proceeding.</P>
              <P>(c) Any dispute resolution communication that is disclosed in violation of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall not be admissible in any proceeding relating to the issues in controversy with respect to which the communication was made.</P>

              <P>(d) (1) The parties may agree between or amongst themselves to alternative confidential procedures for disclosures by a neutral, and shall inform the neutral before commencement of the dispute resolution proceeding of any modifications to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section that will govern the confidentiality of the dispute resolution proceeding, in accordance with the guidance on confidentiality in federal proceedings published by the Interagency ADR Working Group and adopted by the ADR Council (<E T="03">http://www.financenet.gov/financenet/fed/iadrwg/confid.pdf</E>). If the parties do not so inform the neutral, paragraph (a) of this section shall apply.</P>
              <P>(2) To qualify for the exemption under paragraph (j) of this section, an alternative confidential procedure under this subsection may not provide for less disclosure than the confidential procedures otherwise provided under this section.</P>
              <P>(e) If a demand for disclosure, by way of discovery request or other legal process, is made upon a neutral regarding a dispute resolution communication, the neutral shall make reasonable efforts to notify the parties and any affected nonparty participants of the demand. Any party or affected nonparty participant who receives such notice and within 15 calendar days does not offer to defend a refusal of the neutral to disclose the requested information shall have waived any objection to such disclosure.</P>
              <P>(f) Nothing in this section shall prevent the discovery or admissibility of any evidence that is otherwise discoverable, merely because the evidence was presented in the course of a dispute resolution proceeding.</P>
              <P>(g) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall have no effect on the information and data that are necessary to document an agreement reached or order issued pursuant to a dispute resolution proceeding.</P>
              <P>(h) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not prevent the gathering of information for research or educational purposes, in cooperation with other agencies, governmental entities, or dispute resolution programs, so long as the parties and the specific issues in controversy are not identifiable.</P>
              <P>(i) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not prevent use of a dispute resolution communication to resolve a dispute between the neutral in a dispute resolution proceeding and a party to or participant in such proceeding, so long as such dispute resolution communication is disclosed only to the extent necessary to resolve such dispute.</P>
              <P>(j) A dispute resolution communication which is between a neutral and a party and which may not be disclosed under this section shall also be exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Arbitration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) Arbitration may be used as an alternative means of dispute resolution whenever all parties consent, except that arbitration may not be used when the Commission or one of its components is a party. Consent may be obtained either before or after an issue in controversy has arisen. A party may agree to—</P>
              <P>(i) Submit only certain issues in controversy to arbitration; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Arbitration on the condition that the award must be within a range of possible outcomes.</P>
              <P>(2) The arbitration agreement that sets forth the subject matter submitted to the arbitrator shall be in writing. Each such arbitration agreement shall specify a maximum award that may be issued by the arbitrator and may specify other conditions limiting the range of possible outcomes.</P>

The Federal Maritime Commission Dispute Resolution Specialist may withhold such concurrence after considering the factors specified in § 502.403, should the Commission's General Counsel object to use of binding arbitration.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) The Federal Maritime Commission Dispute Resolution Specialist will appoint an arbitrator of the parties' choosing for an arbitration proceeding.</P>
              <P>(2) A Commission officer or employee selected as an arbitrator by the parties and appointed by the Federal Maritime Commission Dispute Resolution Specialist shall have authority to settle an issue in controversy through binding arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement; provided, however, that decisions by arbitrators shall not have precedential value with respect to decisions by Administrative Law Judges or the Commission. Administrative Law Judges may be appointed as arbitrators with the concurrence of the Chief Administrative Law Judge.</P>
              <P>(d) The arbitrator shall be a neutral who meets the criteria of 5 U.S.C. 573.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) The parties to the arbitration are entitled to be heard, to present evidence material to the controversy, and to cross-examine witnesses appearing at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) The arbitrator may, with the consent of the parties, conduct all or part of the hearing by telephone, television, computer, or other electronic means, if each party has an opportunity to participate.</P>
              <P>(3) The hearing shall be conducted expeditiously and in an informal manner.</P>
              <P>(4) The arbitrator may receive any oral or documentary evidence, except that irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or privileged evidence may be excluded by the arbitrator.</P>
              <P>(5) The arbitrator shall interpret and apply relevant statutory and regulatory requirements, legal precedents, and policy directives.</P>
              <P>(d) The provisions of § 502.11 regarding <E T="03">ex parte</E> communications apply to all arbitration proceedings. No interested person shall make or knowingly cause to be made to the arbitrator an unauthorized <E T="03">ex parte</E> communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding, unless the parties agree otherwise. If a communication is made in violation of this subsection, the arbitrator shall ensure that a memorandum of the communication is prepared and made a part of the record, and that an opportunity for rebuttal is allowed. Upon receipt of a communication made in violation of this subsection, the arbitrator may, to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the policies underlying this subchapter, require the offending party to show cause why the claim of such party should not be resolved against such party as a result of the improper conduct.</P>

              <P>(e) The arbitrator shall make an award within 30 days after the close of the hearing, or the date of the filing of any briefs authorized by the arbitrator, <PRTPAGE P="84"/>whichever date is later, unless the parties agree to some other time limit.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (“EAJA”), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”) before the Federal Maritime Commission (“the Commission”). An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over an agency, unless the agency's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this subpart describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use to make them.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When EAJA applies.</E> EAJA applies to any adversary adjudication:</P>
              <P>(1) Pending or commenced before the Commission on or after August 5, 1985;</P>
              <P>(2) Commenced on or after October 1, 1984, and finally disposed of before August 5, 1985, provided that an application for fees and expenses, as described in § 502.502 of this subpart, has been filed with the Commission within 30 days after August 5, 1985; or</P>
              <P>(3) Pending on or commenced on or after October 1, 1981, in which an application for fees and other expenses was timely filed and was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Proceedings covered.</E> (1)(i) EAJA applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the Commission under this <PRTPAGE P="85"/>part. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of this or any other agency of the United States, or any component of any agency, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any proceeding in which the Commission may prescribe a lawful present or future rate is not covered by the Act.</P>
              <P>(iii) Proceedings to grant or renew licenses are also excluded, but proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses are covered if they are otherwise “adversary adjudications.”</P>
              <P>(2) The Commission's failure to identify a type of proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the EAJA; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.</P>
              <P>(3) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by EAJA and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Eligibility of applicants.</E> (1) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under EAJA, the applicant must be a party to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term “party” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this section and § 502.502.</P>
              <P>(2) The types of eligible applicants are:</P>
              <P>(i) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</P>
              <P>(ii) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;</P>
              <P>(iii) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;</P>
              <P>(iv) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and</P>
              <P>(v) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.</P>
              <P>(vi) For purposes of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a small entity as defined in 5 U.S.C. 601.</P>
              <P>(3) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.</P>
              <P>(4) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.</P>
              <P>(5) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.</P>
              <P>(6) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interests of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interests, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this subpart, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of EAJA in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</P>
              <P>(7) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Standards for awards.</E> (1) A prevailing applicant may receive an award <PRTPAGE P="86"/>for fees and expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially justified. The position of the agency includes, in addition to the position taken by the agency in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on agency counsel.</P>
              <P>(2) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.</P>
              <P>(3) In an adversary adjudication arising from a Commission action to enforce a party's compliance with a statutory or regulatory requirement, if the demand by the Commission is substantially in excess of the decision of the presiding officer and is unreasonable under the facts and circumstances of the case, the presiding officer shall award to the party fees and other expenses related to defending against the excessive demand, unless the party has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, or special circumstances make an award unjust.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Allowable fees and expenses.</E> (1) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by the persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.</P>
              <P>(2) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under this subpart may exceed $125 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which the Commission pays expert witnesses. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.</P>
              <P>(3) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall consider the following:</P>
              <P>(i) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fees for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated costs of the services;</P>
              <P>(ii) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;</P>
              <P>(iii) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;</P>
              <P>(iv) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and</P>
              <P>(v) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.</P>
              <P>(4) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the services does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of applicant's case.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Awards against other agencies.</E> If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over another agency of the United States that participates in a proceeding before the Commission and takes a position that is not substantially justified, the award or an appropriate portion of the award shall be made against that agency.

              <P>(4) The petition may also include any other matters that the applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.</P>
              <P>(5) The petition shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and correct.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Net worth exhibit.</E> (1) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its petition a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 502.501(d)(6) of this subpart) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this subpart. The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</P>
              <P>(2) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Commission's established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act under §§ 503.31-503.43 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Documentation of fees and expenses.</E> The petition shall be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rates at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reinbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The adjudicative officer may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses claimed.<PRTPAGE P="88"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">When a petition may be filed.</E> (1) A petition may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the Commission's final disposition of the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of this subpart, final disposition means the date on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the proceeding or any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, becomes final and unappealable, both within the Commission and to the courts.</P>
              <P>(3) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy. When the United States appeals the underlying merits of an adversary adjudication to a court, no decision on an application for fees and other expenses in connection with that adversary adjudication shall be made until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.

              <SECTNO>§ 502.503</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures for considering petitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing and service of documents.</E> (1) Any petition for an award or other pleading or document related to a petition shall be filed and served on all parties to the proceeding in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding, except as provided in § 502.502(b)(2) (confidential financial information).</P>
              <P>(2) The petition and all other pleadings or documents related to the petition will be referred to an Administrative Law Judge to initially decide the matter as adjudicative officer.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reply to petition.</E> (1) Within 30 days after service of a petition, counsel representing the agency against which an award is sought may file a reply to the petition. Unless counsel requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, failure to file a reply within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.</P>
              <P>(2) If agency counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing a reply for an additional 30 days, and further extension may be granted by the adjudicative officer upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.</P>
              <P>(3) The reply shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of counsel's position. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, agency counsel shall include with the reply either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Response to reply.</E> Within 15 days after service of a reply, the applicant may file a response. If the response is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the response either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Comments by other parties.</E> Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and agency counsel may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is served, or on a reply, within 15 days after it is served. A commenting party may not participate further in proceedings on the application unless the adjudicative officer determines that the public interest requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of matters raised in the comments.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Settlement.</E> The applicant and agency counsel may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the underlying proceeding has been concluded in accordance with the rules of this subpart pertaining to settlement. If a prevailing party and agency counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an <PRTPAGE P="89"/>award before a petition is filed, the petition shall be filed with the proposed settlement.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Further proceedings.</E> (1) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant or agency counsel, or on his or her own initiative, the adjudicative officer may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions or, as to issues other than substantial justification (such as the applicant's eligibility or substantiation of fees and expenses), pertinent discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.</P>
              <P>(2) A request that the adjudicative officer order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Decision.</E> The adjudicative officer shall serve an initial decision on the application within 60 days after completion of proceedings on the application. The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on whether the agency's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reason for the allocation made.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Commission review.</E> Either the applicant or agency counsel may seek review of the initial decision on the fee application, or the Commission may decide to review the decision on its own initiative, in accordance with § 502.227 of this part. If neither the applicant nor agency counsel seeks review and the Commission does not take review on its own initiative, the initial decision on the application shall become a final decision of the Commission 30 days after it is issued. Whether to review a decision is a matter within the discretion of the Commission. If review is taken, the Commission will issue a final decision on the application or remand the application to the adjudicative officer for further proceedings.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> Judicial review of final Commission decisions on awards may be sought as provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Payment of award.</E> (1)(i) An applicant seeking payment of an award shall submit to the comptroller or other disbursing officer of the paying agency a copy of the Commission's final decision granting the award, accompanied by a certification that the applicant will not seek review of the decision in the United States courts.</P>
              <P>(ii) The agency will pay the amount awarded to the applicant within 60 days.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the Federal Maritime Commission is the paying agency, the application for payment of award shall be submitted to: Office of Budget and Financial Management, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573. [Rule 503.]</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedure for assessment of penalty.</E> The Commission may assess a civil penalty only after notice and opportunity for hearing. Civil penalty assessment proceedings, including settlement negotiations, shall be governed by the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure in this part. All settlements must be approved by the Presiding Officer. The full text of any settlement must be included in the final order of the Commission.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria for determining amount of penalty.</E> In determining the amount of any penalties assessed, the Commission shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation committed and the policies for deterrence and future compliance with the Commission's rules and regulations and the applicable statutes. The Commission shall also consider the respondent's degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, ability to pay and such other matters as justice requires.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitations; relation to compromise.</E> When the Commission, in its discretion, determines that policy, justice or other circumstances warrant, a civil penalty assessment proceeding may be instituted at any time for any violation which occurred within five years <PRTPAGE P="91"/>prior to the issuance of the order of investigation.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> Except in pending civil penalty assessment proceedings provided for in § 502.603, the Commission, when it has reason to believe a violation has occurred, may invoke the informal compromise procedures of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice.</E> When the Commission considers it appropriate to afford an opportunity for the compromise of a civil penalty, it will, except when otherwise authorized by the Commission, or where circumstances render it unnecessary, send a Notice and Demand Letter (“NDL”) to the respondent, by registered or certified mail, or by other means reasonably calculated to give notice. The NDL will describe specific violation(s) on which the claim is based, including the particular facts, dates and other elements necessary for the respondent to identify the specific conduct constituting the alleged violation; the amount of the penalty demanded; the availability of alternative dispute resolution, including mediation, through the Commission's Office of Consumer Affairs and Dispute Resolution Services; and the names of Commission personnel with whom the demand may be discussed, if the person desires to compromise the penalty. The NDL also will state the deadlines for the institution and completion of compromise negotiations and the consequences of failure to compromise.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Request for compromise.</E> Any person receiving a NDL provided for in paragraph (b) of this section may, within the time specified, deny the violation, or submit matters explaining, mitigating or showing extenuating circumstances, as well as make voluntary disclosures of information and documents.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Criteria for compromise.</E> In addition to the factors set forth in § 502.603(b), in compromising a penalty claim, the Commission may consider litigative probabilities, the cost of collecting the claim and enforcement policy.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Disposition of claims in compromise procedures.</E> (1) When a penalty is compromised and the respondent agrees to settle for that amount, a compromise agreement shall be executed. (One example of such compromise agreement is set forth as appendix A to this subpart.) This agreement, after reciting the nature of the claim, will include a statement evidencing the respondent's agreement to the compromise of the Commission's penalty claim for the amount set forth in the agreement and will also embody an approval and acceptance provision which is to be signed by the appropriate Commission official. Upon compromise of the penalty in the agreed amount, a duplicate original of the executed agreement shall be furnished to the respondent.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon completion of the compromise, the Commission may issue a public notice thereof, the terms and language of which are not subject to negotiation.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Relation to assessment proceedings.</E> Except by order of the Commission, no compromise procedure shall be initiated or continued after institution of a Commission assessment proceeding directed to the same violations. Any offer of compromise submitted by the respondent pursuant to this section shall be deemed to have been furnished by the respondent without prejudice and shall not be used against the respondent in any proceeding.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Delegation of compromise authority.</E> The Director, Bureau of Enforcement, is delegated authority to issue NDLs and compromise civil penalties as set forth in this subpart, provided, however, that approval of the Managing Director is obtained prior to issuance of each NDL and provided further that compromise agreements shall not be effective unless approved by the Managing Director, whose signature evidencing approval shall appear on compromise agreements, in addition to that of the Director of the Bureau of Enforcement. The Director, Bureau of <PRTPAGE P="92"/>Enforcement, has the authority to negotiate the terms of compromise agreements.</P>

The Commission makes the following materials available for public inspection in electronic format on its Web site at <E T="03">www.fmc.gov:</E>

In each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing, and the extent of such deletion shall be indicated on that portion of the record which is made available or published, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by an exemption in § 503.33 under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the extent of the deletion shall be indicated at the place in the record where the deletion was made.</P>
              <P>(c) The Commission maintains and makes available for public inspection in an electronic format, a current log or index providing identifying information for the public as to any matter which is issued, adopted, or promulgated, and which is required by paragraph (a) of this section to be made available or published.</P>
              <P>(1) No final order, opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction that affects any member of the public will be relied upon, used, or cited as precedent by the Commission against any private party unless:</P>
              <P>(i) It has been logged or indexed and either made available or published on its public Web site as provided by this subpart; or</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> Many documents are available on the Commission's public Web site and the Commission encourages requesters visit the Web site before making a request for records under FOIA.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Electronic or written requests.</E> A member of the public may request permission to inspect, copy or be provided with any Commission record not described in subpart C of this part or posted on the Commission's Web site at <E T="03">www.fmc.gov.</E> Such a request must:</P>
              <P>(i) Reasonably describe the record or records sought;</P>
              <P>(ii) Be submitted electronically to <E T="03">FOIA@fmc.gov</E> or in writing to the Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol Street NW., Washington, DC 20573.</P>
              <P>(iii) Be clearly marked on the subject line of an email or on the exterior of the envelope with the term “FOIA.”</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary shall evaluate each request in conjunction with the official having responsibility for the subject matter area and the General Counsel, and the Secretary shall determine whether or not to grant the request in accordance with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) In making any record available to a person under this subpart, the Secretary shall provide the record in any form or format requested by the person if the record is readily reproducible by the Secretary in that form or format.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Determination to grant or deny request.</E> Upon request by any member of the public for documents, made in accordance with the rules of this part, the Commission's Secretary or his or her delegate in his or her absence, shall determine whether or not such request shall be granted.</P>
              <P>(1) Such determination shall be made by the Secretary within twenty (20) business days after receipt of such request, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (e)(4) of this section, and the Secretary shall immediately notify the requester of:</P>
              <P>(i) Such determination and the reasons therefor;</P>

              <P>(ii) The right of such person to seek assistance from the agency's FOIA Public Liaison; and<PRTPAGE P="97"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of an adverse determination, the right of such requester to appeal to the Chairman no less than 90 days after the date of such adverse determination, and the right of such requester to seek dispute resolution services from the agency's FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon granting a request, the Secretary shall promptly make records available to the requestor. Upon denial of such a request the Secretary shall promptly notify the requestor of the determination, explain the reason for denial, give an estimate of the volume of matter denied, and set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial of the request.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Any party whose request for documents or other information pursuant to this part has been denied in whole or in part by the Secretary may appeal such determination. Any such appeal must:</P>
              <P>(A) Be addressed to: Chairman, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, D.C. 20573-0001; and</P>
              <P>(B) Be filed not later than 90 days following receipt of notification of full or partial denial of records requested.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Chairman or the Chairman's specific delegate, in his or her absence, shall make a determination with respect to that appeal within twenty (20) business days after receipt of such appeal, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) If, on appeal, the denial is upheld, either in whole or in part, the Chairman shall so notify the party submitting the appeal and shall notify such person of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4) regarding judicial review of such determination upholding the denial. Notification shall also include the statement that the determination is that of the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission and the name of the Chairman.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Extension of time limits.</E> (1) In unusual circumstances, as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the time limits prescribed with respect to initial actions in response to a FOIA request or actions on appeal may be extended by written notice from the Secretary of the Commission to the person making such request, setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more than ten (10) working days, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) As used in this paragraph, unusual circumstances means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request:</P>
              <P>(i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>
              <P>(ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject matter interest therein.</P>
              <P>(3) If the time limit is extended as prescribed under this section, and the request cannot be processed within the extended time limit, the Secretary shall notify the requestor, and either provide the requestor with an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within the time limit, or provide the requestor an opportunity to arrange with the Secretary an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request. To aid the requester, the Commission will make available its FOIA Public Liaison, who shall assist in the resolution of any dispute between the requester and the Commission, and notify the requester of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.</P>

              <P>(4) The Secretary may make an initial written request to the requestor for information to clarify the request which will toll the 20-day processing period until such information has been received. The 20-day processing period <PRTPAGE P="98"/>will recommence after receipt of the requested information.</P>
              <P>(5) The Secretary may also make written requests to clarify issues regarding fee assessments. Such written requests will toll the 20-day processing period until such information has been received from the requestor. The 20-day processing period will recommence after receipt of the requested information.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Aggregation of requests.</E> Certain requests by the same requestor, or by a group of requestors acting in concert, may be aggregated:</P>
              <P>(1) Upon the Secretary's reasonable belief that such requests actually constitute a single request, which if not aggregated would satisfy the unusual circumstances specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) If the requests involve clearly related matters.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Multitrack processing of requests.</E> The Secretary uses multitrack processing of FOIA requests. Requests which seek and are granted expedited processing are put on the expedited track. All other requests are designated either simple or complex requests based on the amount of time and/or complexity needed to process the request. A request may be considered simple if it involves records that are routinely requested and readily available.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Expedited processing of requests.</E> (1) The Secretary will provide for expedited processing of requests for records when the person requesting the records can demonstrate a compelling need.</P>
              <P>(2) The term <E T="03">compelling need</E> means:</P>
              <P>(i) A failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis under this paragraph could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
              <P>(ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.</P>
              <P>(3) A demonstration of compelling need by a person making a request for expedited processing must be made in the form of a statement describing the circumstances and certified by such person to be true and correct to the best of such person's knowledge and belief.</P>
              <P>(4) The Secretary shall determine whether to provide expedited processing, and provide notice of the determination to the person making the request, within ten (10) calendar days after the receipt date of the request.</P>
              <P>(5) Appeal of the determination not to provide expedited processing should be sought in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of § 503.32, and will be considered expeditiously.</P>
              <P>(6) Any request granted expedited processing shall be processed as soon as practicable.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exceptions to availability of records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following records may be withheld from disclosure:</P>
              <P>(1) Records specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and which are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order. Records to which this provision applies shall be deemed by the Commission to have been properly classified. This exception may apply to records in the custody of the Commission which have been transmitted to the Commission by another agency which has designated the record as nonpublic under an Executive order.</P>
              <P>(2) Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Commission.</P>
              <P>(3) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided that such statute:</P>
              <P>(i) Requires that the matter be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.</P>
              <P>(4) Trade secrets and commercial financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.</P>

              <P>(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters that would not be available by law to a party other <PRTPAGE P="99"/>than an agency in litigation with the Commission, provided that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested.</P>
              <P>(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</P>
              <P>(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:</P>
              <P>(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>
              <P>(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</P>
              <P>(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
              <P>(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</P>
              <P>(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.</P>
              <P>(8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or</P>
              <P>(9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.</P>
              <P>(b) Nothing in this section authorizes withholding of information or limiting the availability of records to the public except as specifically stated in this part, nor shall this part be authority to withhold information from Congress.</P>
              <P>(c) Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this part. The amount of information deleted shall be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in this section under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made.</P>
              <P>(d) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records described in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section and the investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law, and there is reason to believe that the subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the Commission may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552 and this subpart.</P>

              <P>The Commission shall follow the procedures set forth in this part.</P>
              <P>(a) If oral testimony is sought by a demand in any case or matter in which the United States is not a party, an affidavit, or, if that is not feasible, a statement by the party seeking the testimony or by his attorney, setting forth a summary of the testimony sought and its relevance to the proceeding, must be furnished to the Commission. Any authorization for testimony by a present or former employee of the Commission shall be limited to the scope of the demand as summarized in such statement.</P>
              <P>(b) When information other than oral testimony is sought by a demand, the Commission shall request a summary of the information sought and its relevance to the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(c) Permission to testify or to release documents in all cases will be limited to matters outlined in the affidavit or declaration described in § 503.41(a) and (b), or to such matters as deemed appropriate by the Commission. If the Commission, in considering the factors in § 503.39, allows the release of documents or testimony to be given by an employee, arrangements shall be made for the taking of testimony or receipt of documents by the method least disruptive to the employee's official duties. Testimony may, for example, be provided by affidavits, answers to interrogatories, written depositions, or depositions transcribed, recorded, or preserved by any other means allowable by law.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon issuance of a final determination to not authorize testimony or release of Commission information by the Commission, the party or the party's counsel seeking testimony or documents may consult or negotiate with the Commission to refine and limit the demand.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> The Commission may condition the production of records or appearance for testimony upon advance payment of a reasonable estimate of the costs to the Commission.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Fees for records.</E> Fees for producing records will include fees for searching, reviewing, and duplicating records, costs of attorney time spent in reviewing the demand or request, and expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. Costs for employee time will be calculated on the basis of the hourly pay of the employee (including all pay, allowance, and benefits). Fees for duplication will be the same as those charged by the Commission in its regulations at subpart F of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Witness fees.</E> Fees for attendance by a witness will include fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules. If no such fees are prescribed, witness fees will be determined based upon the rule of the Federal district court closest to the location where the witness will appear. Such fees will include cost of time spent by the witness to prepare for testimony, in travel, and for attendance at the legal proceeding.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment of fees.</E> The seeking party must pay witness fees for current Commission employees and any records certification fees by submitting to the General Counsel a check or money order for the appropriate amount made payable to the Treasury of the United States. In the case of testimony by former Commission employees, applicable fees must be paid directly to the former employee in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821, per diem and mileage, or other applicable statutes.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Certification (authentication) of copies of records.</E> The Commission may certify that records are true copies in order to facilitate their use as evidence. If certified records are sought, the request for certified copies shall be made at least 45 days before the date <PRTPAGE P="103"/>they will be needed. The request should be sent to the General Counsel. Fees for certification will be the same as those charged by the Commission in its regulations at subpart F of this part.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> The Commission may, upon a showing of reasonable cause, waive or reduce any fees in connection with testimony, production, or certification of records.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">De minimis fees.</E> Fees will not be assessed if the total charge would be $10.00 or less.</P>

In extraordinary situations, the Commission will accept requests for waivers or fee reductions. Such requests are to be made to the Secretary of the Commission at the time of the information request or the filing of documents and must demonstrate that the waiver or reduction of a fee is in the best interest of the public, or that payment of a fee would impose an undue hardship. The Secretary will notify the requestor of the decision to grant or deny the request for waiver or reduction.</P>
              <P>(a) Upon request, the following services are available upon the payment of the fees hereinafter prescribed; except that no fees shall be assessed for search, duplication or review in connection with requests for single copies of materials described in §§ 503.11 and 503.21:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fees for services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to the terms when used in this subpart:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Search</E> means all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Search for material will be done in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both the agency and the requester. Search is distinguished, moreover, from <E T="03">review</E> of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a Freedom of Information Act or other request. Such copies can take the form of paper or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Review</E> means the process of examining documents located in response to a commercial use request to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents <PRTPAGE P="104"/>for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> means a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the agency must determine the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. Where the agency has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the agency will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is not operated on a <E T="03">commercial</E> basis as that term is referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term <E T="03">news</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of <E T="03">news</E>) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. As traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category. <E T="03">Freelance</E> journalists, may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the agency may also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenditures which the agency actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requester, reviewing) documents to respond to a Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 17.5 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The basic fees set forth in paragraph (c) of this section provide for documents to be mailed with postage prepaid. If copy is to be transmitted by registered, certified, air, or special delivery mail, postage therefor will be added to the basic fee. Also, if special handling or packaging is required, costs thereof will be added to the basic fee.</P>
              <P>(2) The fees for search, duplication and review set forth in paragraph (c) of this section reflect the full allowable direct costs expected to be incurred by the agency for the service. Costs of search and review may be assessed even if it is determined that disclosure of the records is to be withheld. Cost of search may be assessed even if the agency fails to locate the records. Requesters much reasonably describe the records sought. The following restrictions, limitations and guidelines apply to the assessment of such fees:</P>

              <P>(i) For commercial use requesters, charges recovering full direct costs for <PRTPAGE P="105"/>search, review and duplication of records will be assessed.</P>
              <P>(ii) For educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters, no charge will be assessed for search or review of records. Charges recovering full direct costs for duplication of records will be assessed, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is being made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.</P>
              <P>(iii) For representative of the news media requesters, no charge will be assessed for search or review of records. Charges recovering full direct costs for duplication of records will be assessed, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.</P>
              <P>(iv) For all other requesters, no charge will be assessed for review of records. Charges recovering full direct costs for search and duplication of records will be assessed excluding charges for the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time. Requests from individuals for records about themselves, filed in a Commission system of records, will be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1984 which permit fees only for duplication.</P>
              <P>(v) No fee may be charged for search, review or duplication if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to exceed the amount of the fee.</P>
              <P>(vi) Documents shall be furnished without any charge or at a reduced charge if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In determining whether a waiver or reduction of charges is appropriate the following factors will be taken into consideration.</P>
              <P>(A) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the government;</P>
              <P>(B) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
              <P>(C) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding;</P>
              <P>(D) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
              <P>(E) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so</P>
              <P>(F) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
              <P>(vii) Whenever it is anticipated that fees chargeable under this section will exceed $25.00 and the requester has not indicated in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as anticipated, the requester will be notified of the amount of the anticipated fee. In such cases the requester will be given an opportunity to confer with Commission personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet the needs of the requester at a lower cost.</P>
              <P>(viii) Interest may be charged record requesters who fail to pay fees assessed. Assessment of interest may begin on the amount billed starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C., and will accrue from the date of the billings. Receipt of payment by the agency will stay the accrual of interest.</P>

              <P>(ix) Whenever it reasonably appears that a requester of records or a group of requesters is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests <PRTPAGE P="106"/>for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, such requests will be aggregated and fees assessed accordingly. Multiple requests on unrelated subjects will not be aggregated.</P>
              <P>(x) The agency may require a requester to make advance payment only when:</P>
              <P>(A) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), in which case the requester will be required to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided above, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requester; or</P>
              <P>(B) The agency estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250, in which case, the agency will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or will require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment.</P>
              <P>(xi) Unless applicable fees are paid, the agency may use the authorities of the Debt Collection Act (Pub. L. 97-365), including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies where appropriate to encourage payment.</P>
              <P>(xii) Whenever action is taken under paragraphs (b)(2)(viii) and (b)(2)(ix) of this section, the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of 5 U.S.C. 552 (i.e., 10 working days from receipt of initial requests and 20 working days from receipt of appeals from initial denial, plus permissible extensions of these time limits will begin only after the Commission has received fee payments described above.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Charges for search, review, duplication and certification.</E> (1) Records search (including electronic search) will be performed by Commission personnel at the following rates:</P>
              <P>(i) Search will be performed by clerical/administrative personnel at a rate of $52 per hour and by professional/executive personnel at a rate of $81 per hour.</P>
              <P>(ii) Unless an exception provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies, the minimum charge for record search is $31.</P>
              <P>(2) Charges for review of records to determine whether they are exempt from disclosure under § 503.33 must be assessed to recover full costs at the rate of $105 per hour. Charges for review will be assessed only for initial review to determine the applicability of a specific exemptions to a particular record. No charge will be assessed for review at the administrative appeal level.</P>
              <P>(3) Charges for duplication of records and documents will be assessed as follows, limited to size 8<FR>1/2</FR>″ × 14″ or smaller:</P>
              <P>(i) If performed by requesting party at the rate of ten cents per page (one side).</P>
              <P>(ii) By Commission personnel, at the rate of ten cents per page (one side) plus $52 per hour.</P>
              <P>(iii) Unless an exception provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies, the minimum charge for copying is $6.</P>
              <P>(iv) No charge will be made by the Commission for notices, decisions, orders, etc., required by law to be served on a party to any proceeding or matter before the Commission. No charge will be made for single copies of such Commission issuances individually requested in person or by mail.</P>
              <P>(4) The certification and validation (with Federal Maritime Commission seal) of documents filed with or issued by the Commission will be available at $124 for each certification.</P>
              <P>(d) Applications for admission to practice before the Commission for persons not attorneys at law must be accompanied by a fee of $208 pursuant to § 502.27 of this chapter.</P>

If, in the opinion of the General Counsel, the closing of a portion or portions of a meeting or portion or portions of a series of meetings is proper under the provisions of this subpart and the terms of the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b), his or her certification of that opinion shall cite each applicable, particular, <PRTPAGE P="122"/>exemptive provision of that Act and provision of this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General rule—information pertaining to meeting.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) As defined in § 503.71, all information pertaining to a portion or portions of a meeting or portion or portions of a series of meetings of the agency shall be disclosed to the public unless excepted from such disclosure under §§ 503.79, 503.80 and 503.81.</P>
              <P>(b) All inquiries as to the status of pending matters which were considered by the Commission in closed session should be directed to the Secretary of the Commission. Commission personnel who attend closed meetings of the Commission are prohibited from disclosing anything that occurs during those meetings. An employee's failure to respect the confidentiality of closed meetings constitutes a violation of Commission's General Standards of Conduct. The Commission can, of course, determine to make public the events or decisions occurring in a closed meeting, such information to be disseminated by the Office of the Secretary. An inquiry to the Office of the Secretary as to whether any information has been made public is not, therefore, improper. However, a request of or attempt to persuade a Commission employee to divulge the contents of a closed meeting constitutes a lack of proper professional conduct inappropriate to a person practicing before this agency, and requires that the employee file a report of such event so that a determination can be made whether disciplinary action should be initiated pursuant to § 502.30 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(b) This part applies to all actions of the Federal Maritime Commission (Commission). To the extent possible, the Commission shall integrate the requirements of NEPA with its obligations under section 382(b) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C. 6362.</P>
            <P>(c) Information obtained under this part is used by the Commission to assess potential environmental impacts of proposed Federal Maritime Commission actions. Compliance is voluntary but may be made mandatory by Commission order to produce the information pursuant to section 15 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40104). The penalty for violation of a Commission order under section 13 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 41107-41109) may not exceed $5,000 for each violation, unless the violation was willfully and knowingly committed, in which case the amount of the civil penalty may not exceed $25,000 for each violation, as adjusted by § 506.4 of this chapter. (Each day of a continuing violation constitutes a separate offense.)</P>

            <SUBJECT>Finding of no significant impact.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) If upon completion of an environmental assessment, it is determined that a potential or proposed action will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment of the United States or of the global commons, a finding of no significant impact shall be prepared and notice of its availability published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> This document shall include the environmental assessment or a summary of it, and shall briefly present the reasons why the potential or proposed action, not otherwise excluded under § 504.4, will not have a significant effect on the human environment and why, therefore, an environmental impact statement (EIS) will not be prepared.</P>

            <P>(b) Petitions for review of a finding of no significant impact must be received <PRTPAGE P="130"/>by the Commission within ten (10) days from the date of publication of the notice of its availability in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The Commission shall review the petitions and either deny them or order prepared an EIS pursuant to § 504.7. The Commission shall, within ten (10) days of receipt of the petition, serve copies of its order upon all parties who filed comments concerning the potential or proposed action or who filed petitions for review.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) An environmental impact statement (EIS) shall be prepared when the environmental assessment indicates that a potential or proposed action may have a significant impact upon the environment of the United States or the global commons.</P>
            <P>(2) The EIS process will commence:</P>
            <P>(i) For adjudicatory proceedings, when the Commission issues an order of investigation or a complaint is filed;</P>
            <P>(ii) For rulemaking or legislative proposals, upon issuance of the proposal by the Commission; and</P>

            <P>(iii) For other actions, the time the action is noticed in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(3) The major decision points in the EIS process are:</P>
            <P>(i) The issuance of an initial decision in those cases assigned to be heard by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ); and</P>
            <P>(ii) The issuance of the Commission's final decision or report on the action.</P>
            <P>(4) The EIS shall consider potentially significant impacts upon the quality of the human environment of the United States and, in appropriate cases, upon the environment of the global commons outside the jurisdiction of any nation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Draft environmental impact statements.</E> (1) A draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) will initially be prepared in accordance with 40 CFR part 1502.</P>
            <P>(2) The DEIS shall be distributed to every party to a Commission proceeding for which it was prepared. There will be no fee charged to such parties. One copy per person will also be provided to interested persons at their request. The fee charged such persons shall be that provided in § 503.43 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(3) Comments on the DEIS must be received by the Commission within ten (10) days of the date the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publishes in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice that the DEIS was filed with it. Sixteen copies shall be submitted as provided in § 504.3(a). Comments shall be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the DEIS or the merits of the alternatives discussed in it. All comments received will be made available to the public. Extensions of time for commenting on the DEIS may be granted by the Commission for up to ten (10) days if good cause is shown.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Final environmental impact statements.</E> (1) After receipt of comments on the DEIS, a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) will be prepared pursuant to 40 CFR part 1502, which shall include a discussion of the possible alternative actions to a potential or proposed action. The FEIS will be distributed in the same manner as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) The FEIS shall be prepared prior to the Commission's final decision and shall be filed with the Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission. Upon filing, it shall become part of the administrative record.</P>
            <P>(3) For any Commission action which has been assigned to an ALJ for evidentiary hearing:</P>
            <P>(i) The FEIS shall be submitted prior to the close of the record, and</P>
            <P>(ii) The ALJ shall consider the environmental impacts and alternatives contained in the FEIS in preparing the initial decision.</P>

            <P>(4)(i) For all proposed Commission actions, any party may, by petition to the Commission within ten (10) days following EPA's notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> assert that the FEIS contains a substantial and material error of fact which can only be properly resolved by conducting an evidentiary hearing, and expressly request that such a hearing be held. Other parties may submit replies to the petition within ten (10) days of its receipt.</P>

            <P>(ii) The Commission may delineate the issue(s) and refer them to an ALJ <PRTPAGE P="131"/>for expedited resolution or may elect to refer the petition to an ALJ for consideration.</P>
            <P>(iii) The ALJ shall make findings of fact on the issue(s) and shall certify such findings to the Commission as a supplement to the FEIS. To the extent that such findings differ from the FEIS, it shall be modified by the supplement.</P>
            <P>(iv) Discovery may be granted by the ALJ on a showing of good cause and, if granted, shall proceed on an expedited basis.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Chairman or his or her designee, after attempting to collect a debt from a person under section 3(a) of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as assembled (31 U.S.C. 3711(a)), may collect the debt by administrative offset subject to the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The debt is certain in amount; and</P>
            <P>(2) It is in the best interests of the United States to collect the debt by administrative offset because of the decreased costs of collection and the acceleration in the payment of the debt.</P>
            <P>(b) The Chairman, or his or her designee, may initiate administrative offset with regard to debts owed by a person to another agency of the United States Government, upon receipt of a request from the head of another agency or his or her designee, and a certification that the debt exists and that the person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.</P>
            <P>(c) The Chairman, or his or her designee, may request another agency that holds funds payable to a Commission debtor to offset the debt against the funds held and will provide certification that:</P>
            <P>(1) The debt exists; and</P>
            <P>(2) The person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.</P>
            <P>(d) If the six-year period for bringing action on a debt provided in 28 U.S.C. 2415 has expired, then administrative offset may be used to collect the debt only if the costs of bringing such action are likely to be less than the amount of the debt.</P>
            <P>(e) No collection by administrative offset shall be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than 10 years unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering and collecting such debt.</P>
            <P>(f) These regulations do not apply to:</P>

            <P>(1) A case in which administrative offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute; or<PRTPAGE P="133"/>
            </P>

            <P>(a) A description of the nature and amount of the debt and the intention of the Commission to collect the debt through administrative offset;</P>
            <P>(b) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the Commission with respect to the debt;</P>
            <P>(c) An opportunity for review within the Commission of the determination of the Commission with respect to the debt; and</P>
            <P>(d) An opportunity to enter into a written agreement for the repayment of the amount of the debt.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Agency review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A debtor may dispute the existence of the debt, the amount of debt, or the terms of repayment. A request to review a disputed debt must be submitted to the Commission official who provided notification within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the written notice described in § 505.4.</P>
            <P>(b) If the debtor requests an opportunity to inspect or copy the Commission's records concerning the disputed claim, 10 business days will be granted for the review. The time period will be measured from the time the request for inspection is granted or from the time the copy of the records is received by the debtor.</P>
            <P>(c) Pending the resolution of a dispute by the debtor, transactions in any of the debtor's account(s) maintained in the Commission may be temporarily suspended. Depending on the type of transaction the suspension could preclude its payment, removal, or transfer, as well as prevent the payment of interest or discount due thereon. Should the dispute be resolved in the debtor's favor, the suspension will be immediately lifted.</P>
            <P>(d) During the review period, interest, penalties, and administrative costs authorized under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1996, as amended, will continue to accrue.</P>

            <P>A debtor who admits liability but elects not to have the debt collected by administrative offset will be afforded an opportunity to negotiate a written agreement for the repayment of the debt. If the financial condition of the debtor does not support the ability to pay in one lump-sum, reasonable installments may be considered. No installment arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits a financial statement, executed under penalty of perjury, reflecting the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The financial statement must be submitted within 10 business days of the Commission's request for the statement. At the Commission's option, a confess-judgment note or bond of indemnity with surety may be required for installment agreements. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any reduction or compromise of a claim will be governed by 4 CFR part 103.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Administrative offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If the debtor does not exercise the right to request a review within the time specified in § 505.5 or if as a result of the review, it is determined that the debt is due and no written agreement is executed, then administrative offset shall be ordered in accordance with these regulations without further notice.</P>
            <P>(b) Requests for offset to other Federal agencies. The Chairman or his or her designee may request that funds due and payable to a debtor by another Federal agency be administratively offset in order to collect a debt owed to the Commission by that debtor. In requesting administrative offset, the Commission, as creditor, will certify in writing to the Federal agency holding funds of the debtor:</P>
            <P>(1) That the debtor owes the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) The amount and basis of the debt; and</P>

            <P>(3) That the agency has complied with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716, <PRTPAGE P="134"/>its own administrative offset regulations and the applicable provisions of 4 CFR part 102 with respect to providing the debtor with due process.</P>
            <P>(c) Requests for offset from other Federal agencies. Any Federal agency may request that funds due and payable to its debtor by the Commission be administratively offset in order to collect a debt owed to such Federal agency by the debtor. The Commission shall initiate the requested offset only upon:</P>
            <P>(1) Receipt of written certification from the creditor agency:</P>
            <P>(i) That the debtor owes the debt;</P>
            <P>(ii) The amount and basis of the debt;</P>
            <P>(iii) That the agency has prescribed regulations for the exercise of administrative offset; and</P>
            <P>(iv) That the agency has complied with its own administrative offset regulations and with the applicable provisions of 4 CFR part 102, including providing any required hearing or review.</P>
            <P>(2) A determination by the Commission that collection by offset against funds payable by the Commission would be in the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and that such offset would not otherwise be contrary to law.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Jeopardy procedure.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Commission may effect an administrative offset against a payment to be made to the debtor prior to the completion of the procedures required by §§ 505.4 and 505.5 of this part if failure to take the offset would substantially jeopardize the Commission's ability to collect the debt, and the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. Such prior offset shall be promptly followed by the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by offset but later found not to be owed to the Commission shall be promptly refunded.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
            <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 507.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements <PRTPAGE P="140"/>to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 507.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 507.150 (a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
            <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
            <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
            <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
            <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
            <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

            <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
            <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
            <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
            <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>

            <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons <PRTPAGE P="141"/>with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
            <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
            <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 507.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

            <P>(e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity.</P>
            <P>(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>

              <P>(a) Any NVOCC whose primary place of business is located outside the United States and does not elect to become licensed by the Commission shall register with the Commission by submitting to the Director of the Bureau of Certification and Licensing (BCL) a completed registration form, Form FMC-65 (Foreign-based Unlicensed NVOCC Registration/Renewal). A notice of each registration shall be published on the Commission's Web site <E T="03">www.fmc.gov.</E> It is a violation of the Commission's regulations implementing the Shipping Act for a foreign-based unlicensed non-vessel-operating common carrier to provide NVOCC services in the U.S. foreign trade without a valid registration and an effective tariff.</P>

              <P>(b) A registration form which appears, upon submission, to be substantially incomplete may be rejected. If <PRTPAGE P="152"/>rejected, a notice, together with the reasons therefore, shall be sent to the foreign-based unlicensed NVOCC. Persons who have had a registration rejected may submit a new registration at any time.</P>
              <P>(c) Registrations are complete upon receipt of a registration form which meets the requirements of this section and upon evidence of financial responsibility being furnished pursuant to § 515.21.</P>
              <P>(d) Registrations shall be effective for a period of three (3) years. Thereafter, registrations will be renewed for sequential three year periods upon submission of an updated registration form.</P>
              <P>(e) A tariff shall not be published and NVOCC service shall not commence until the Commission receives valid proof of financial responsibility from the registrant and a Form FMC-1 has been filed.</P>
              <P>(f) Registered NVOCCs must report in writing to BCL any changes, within 30 days of such changes, to: legal name(s) or trade name(s); principal place of business address (including telephone number, facsimile number); contact person and email address (including physical address if different from principal place of business); name of resident agent(s) (including physical address, mailing address, email address, telephone and facsimile number(s), and contact person) in the United States for receipt of service of judicial and administrative process (including subpoenas).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Termination or suspension of registration</E>—(1) <E T="03">Grounds.</E> A registration shall become automatically ineffective for a failure of a registered NVOCC to maintain proof of financial responsibility on file with the Commission. The effectiveness of such a registration may otherwise be terminated or suspended, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, for any of the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(i) Violation of any provision of the Act, or any other statute or Commission order or regulation related to carrying on the business of an ocean transportation intermediary;</P>
              <P>(ii) Failure to respond to any lawful order or inquiry by the Commission or an authorized Commission representative;</P>

              <P>(vii) Knowingly and willfully processing, booking, or accepting cargo from, or transporting cargo for the account of, an NVOCC that is not licensed or registered, or has not provided proof of financial responsibility or published an effective tariff; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Failure to designate and maintain a person in the United Stated as legal agent for the receipt of judicial and administrative process, including subpoenas, as required by § 515.24.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Hearing procedure.</E> Registrants may request a hearing for terminations or suspensions of the effectiveness of their registrations following the same procedures set forth in § 515.17 (governing hearing requests for denials, revocations and suspensions of licenses).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Claims against an ocean transportation intermediary.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Who may seek payment.</E> Shippers, common carriers, and other affected persons may seek payment from the bond, insurance, or other surety maintained by an ocean transportation intermediary for damages arising out of its ocean transportation-related activities. The Commission may also seek payment of civil penalties assessed under section 13 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41107-41109).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment pursuant to a claim.</E> (1) If a person does not file a complaint with the Commission pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41301-41302, 41305-41307(a)), but otherwise seeks to pursue a claim against an ocean transportation intermediary bond, insurance, or other surety for damages arising from its transportation-related activities, it shall attempt to resolve its claim with the financial responsibility provider prior to seeking payment on any judgment for damages obtained. When a claimant seeks payment under this section, it simultaneously shall notify both the financial responsibility provider and the ocean transportation intermediary of the claim by mail or courier service. The bond, insurance, or other surety may be available to pay such claim if:</P>
              <P>(i) The ocean transportation intermediary consents to payment, subject to review by the financial responsibility provider; or</P>

              <P>(ii) The ocean transportation intermediary fails to respond within forty-<PRTPAGE P="157"/>five (45) days from the date of the notice of the claim to address the validity of the claim, and the financial responsibility provider deems the claim valid.</P>
              <P>(2) If the parties fail to reach an agreement in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section within ninety (90) days of the date of the initial notification of the claim, the bond, insurance, or other surety shall be available to pay any final judgment for reparations ordered by the Commission or damages obtained from an appropriate court. The financial responsibility provider shall pay such judgment for damages only to the extent they arise from the transportation-related activities of the ocean transportation intermediary, ordinarily within thirty (30) days, without requiring further evidence related to the validity of the claim; it may, however, inquire into the extent to which the judgment for damages arises from the ocean transportation intermediary's transportation-related activities.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notices of court and other claims against OTIs by financial responsibility providers.</E> (1) As provided in each financial responsibility instrument between an OTI and its financial responsibility provider(s), the issuing financial responsibility provider shall submit a notice to the Commission of each claim, court action, or court judgment against the financial responsibility and each claim paid (including the amount) by the provider.</P>

              <P>(2) Notices described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be promptly submitted in writing by mail or email (<E T="03">bcl@fmc.gov</E>) to the Director, Bureau of Certification and Licensing, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573.</P>
              <P>(3) Notices required by this section shall include the name of the claimant, name of the court and case number assigned, and the name and license number of the OTI involved. Such notices may include or attach other information relevant to the claim.</P>
              <P>(d) The Federal Maritime Commission shall not serve as depository or distributor to third parties of bond, guaranty, or insurance funds in the event of any claim, judgment, or order for reparation.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Optional bond riders.</E> The Federal Maritime Commission shall not serve as a depository or distributor to third parties of funds payable pursuant to optional bond riders described in § 515.25(b).</P>

              <P>(a) Every ocean transportation intermediary not located in the United States and every group or association of ocean transportation intermediaries not located in the United States which provides financial coverage for the financial responsibility of a member ocean transportation intermediary shall designate and maintain a person in the United States as legal agent for the receipt of judicial and administrative process, including subpoenas.</P>
              <P>(b) Service of administrative process, other than subpoenas, may be effected upon the legal agent by dispatching a copy of the document to be served by mail or courier service. Administrative subpoenas shall be served in accordance with § 502.134 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(c) If the designated legal agent cannot be served because of death, disability, unavailability, termination or expiration of the designation, or if a legal agent authorized to receive such service is not designated in compliance with this section, the Secretary of the Federal Maritime Commission will be deemed to be the legal agent for service of process. Any person serving the Secretary must also send to the ocean transportation intermediary, or group or association of ocean transportation intermediaries which provide financial coverage for the financial responsibilities of a member ocean transportation intermediary, by mail or courier service at the ocean transportation intermediary's, or group's, address published in its tariff, a copy of each document served upon the Secretary, and shall attest to that service at the time service is made upon the Secretary. For purposes of this paragraph, it is sufficient that a person seeking to serve process on an ocean transportation intermediary, or group of such intermediaries, affirm to the Commission's Secretary that: they have contacted, or attempted to contact, the designated agent to confirm whether it <PRTPAGE P="158"/>remained authorized to accept service of process; or, if no legal agent is designated in the tariff, that it has no knowledge of the identity of the ocean transportation intermediary's legal agent. Designation of the Commission's Secretary as the legal agent shall survive any cancellation of the OTI's license or tariff and shall continue for the entire period during which claims may be made under the OTI's financial responsibility instrument.</P>
              <P>(d) Designations of legal agent under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and provisions relating to service of process under paragraph (c) of this section shall be published in the ocean transportation intermediary's tariff, when required, in accordance with part 520 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) Every ocean transportation intermediary using a group or association of ocean transportation intermediaries to cover its financial responsibility requirement under § 515.21(b) shall publish the name and address of the group or association's resident agent for receipt of judicial and administrative process, including subpoenas, in its tariff, when required, in accordance with part 520 of this chapter.</P>

No license will be issued until the Commission is in receipt of valid proof of financial responsibility from the applicant. If, within 120 days of notification of approval for licensing by the Commission, the applicant does not file proof that its financial responsibility is in effect, the application will be invalid.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Compensation or fee sharing.</E> No licensed freight forwarder shall share, directly or indirectly, any compensation or freight forwarding fee with a shipper, consignee, seller, or purchaser, or an agent, affiliate, or employee thereof; nor with any person advancing the purchase price of the property or guaranteeing payment therefor; nor with any person having a beneficial interest in the shipment.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Receipt for cargo.</E> Each receipt for cargo issued by a licensed freight forwarder shall be clearly identified as “Receipt for Cargo” and be readily distinguishable from a bill of lading.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reduced forwarding fees.</E> No licensed freight forwarder shall render, or offer to render, any freight forwarding service free of charge or at a reduced fee in consideration of receiving compensation from a common carrier or for any other reason. <E T="03">Exception:</E> A licensed freight forwarder may perform freight forwarding services for recognized relief agencies or charitable organizations, which are designated as such in the tariff of the common carrier, free of charge or at reduced fees.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">In-plant arrangements.</E> A licensed freight forwarder may place an employee or employees on the premises of its principal as part of the services rendered to such principal, provided:<PRTPAGE P="162"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) The in-plant forwarder arrangement is reduced to writing and identifies all services provided by either party (whether or not constituting a freight forwarding service); states the amount of compensation to be received by either party for such services; sets forth all details concerning the procurement, maintenance or sharing of office facilities, personnel, furnishings, equipment and supplies; describes all powers of supervision or oversight of the licensee's employee(s) to be exercised by the principal; and details all procedures for the administration or management of in-plant arrangements between the parties; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Forwarder and carrier compensation; fees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Disclosure of principal.</E> The identity of the shipper must always be disclosed in the shipper identification box on the bill of lading. The licensed freight forwarder's name may appear with the name of the shipper, but the forwarder must be identified as the shipper's agent.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Certification required for compensation.</E> A common carrier may pay compensation to a licensed freight forwarder only pursuant to such common carrier's tariff provisions. When a common carrier's tariff provides for the payment of compensation, such compensation shall be paid on any shipment forwarded on behalf of others where the forwarder has provided a certification as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section and the shipper has been disclosed on the bill of lading as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section. The common carrier shall be entitled to rely on such certification unless it knows that the certification is incorrect. The common carrier shall retain such certifications for a period of five (5) years.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Form of certification.</E> When a licensed freight forwarder is entitled to compensation, the forwarder shall provide the common carrier with a certification which indicates that the forwarder has performed the required services that entitle it to compensation. The required certification may be provided electronically by the forwarder or may be placed on one copy of the relevant bill of lading, a summary statement from the forwarder, the forwarder's compensation invoice, or as an endorsement on the carrier's compensation check. Electronic certification must contain confirmations by the forwarder and the carrier identifying the shipments upon which forwarding compensation may be paid. Each forwarder shall retain evidence in its shipment files that the forwarder, in fact, has performed the required services enumerated on the certification. The certification shall read as follows:
              </P>
              <P>The undersigned hereby certifies that neither it nor any holding company, subsidiary, affiliate, officer, director, agent or executive of the undersigned has a beneficial interest in this shipment; that it is the holder of valid FMC License No. __, issued by the Federal Maritime Commission and has performed the following services:</P>
              <P>(1) Engaged, booked, secured, reserved, or contracted directly with the carrier or its agent for space aboard a vessel or confirmed the availability of that space; and</P>

              <P>(2) Prepared and processed the ocean bill of lading, dock receipt, or other similar document with respect to the shipment.
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Compensation pursuant to tariff provisions.</E> No licensed freight forwarder, or employee thereof, shall accept compensation from a common carrier which is different from that specifically provided for in the carrier's effective tariff(s). No conference or group of common carriers shall deny in the export commerce of the United States compensation to an ocean freight forwarder or limit that compensation, as provided for by section 19(e)(4) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 40904(d)) and 46 CFR part 535.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Electronic data interchange.</E> A licensed freight forwarder may own, operate, or otherwise maintain or supervise an electronic data interchange-based computer system in its forwarding business; however, the forwarder must directly perform value-<PRTPAGE P="163"/>added services as described in paragraph (c) of this section in order to be entitled to carrier compensation.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Compensation; services performed by underlying carrier; exemptions.</E> No licensed freight forwarder shall charge or collect compensation in the event the underlying common carrier, or its agent, has, at the request of such forwarder, performed any of the forwarding services set forth in § 515.2(h), unless such carrier or agent is also a licensed freight forwarder, or unless no other licensed freight forwarder is willing and able to perform such services.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Duplicative compensation.</E> A common carrier shall not pay compensation for the services described in paragraph (c) of this section more than once on the same shipment.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Non-vessel-operating common carriers; compensation.</E> (1) A licensee operating as an NVOCC and a freight forwarder, or a person related thereto, may collect compensation when, and only when, the following certification is made together with the certification required under paragraph (c) of this section:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>The undersigned certifies that neither it nor any related person has issued a bill of lading or otherwise undertaken common carrier responsibility as a non-vessel-operating common carrier for the ocean transportation of the shipment covered by this bill of lading.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(2) Whenever a person acts in the capacity of an NVOCC as to any shipment, such person shall not collect compensation, nor shall any underlying ocean common carrier pay compensation to such person, for such shipment.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Compensation; beneficial interest.</E> A licensed freight forwarder may not receive compensation from a common carrier with respect to any shipment in which the forwarder has a beneficial interest or with respect to any shipment in which any holding company, subsidiary, affiliate, officer, director, agent, or executive of such forwarder has a beneficial interest.</P>

              <P>Whereas, Principal operates as an OTI in the waterborne foreign commerce of the United States in accordance with the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. 40101-41309, and, if necessary, has a valid tariff published pursuant to 46 CFR part 515 and 520, and pursuant to section 19 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 40901-40904), files this bond with the Commission;</P>
              <P>Whereas, this bond is written to ensure compliance by the Principal with section 19 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 40901-40904), and the rules and regulations of the Federal Maritime Commission relating to evidence of financial responsibility for OTIs (46 CFR part 515), this bond shall be available to pay any judgment obtained or any settlement made pursuant to a claim under 46 CFR 515.23 for damages against the Principal arising from the Principal's transportation-related activities under the Shipping Act, or order for reparations issued pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41301-41302, 41305-41307(a)), or any penalty assessed against the Principal pursuant to section 13 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41107-41109).</P>

              <P>Now, Therefore, The condition of this obligation is that the penalty amount of this bond shall be available to pay any judgment or any settlement made pursuant to a claim <PRTPAGE P="164"/>under 46 CFR 515.23 for damages against the Principal arising from the Principal's transportation-related activities or order for reparations issued pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41301-41302, 41305-41307(a)), or any penalty assessed against the Principal pursuant to section 13 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41107-41109).</P>
              <P>This bond shall inure to the benefit of any and all persons who have obtained a judgment or a settlement made pursuant to a claim under 46 CFR § 515.23 for damages against the Principal arising from its transportation-related activities or order of reparation issued pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41301-41302, 41305-41307(a)), and to the benefit of the Federal Maritime Commission for any penalty assessed against the Principal pursuant to section 13 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41107-41109). However, the bond shall not apply to shipments of used household goods and personal effects for the account of the Department of Defense or the account of federal civilian executive agencies shipping under the International Household Goods Program administered by the General Services Administration.</P>
              <P>The liability of the Surety shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder, unless and until such payment or payments shall aggregate the penalty amount of this bond, and in no event shall the Surety's total obligation hereunder exceed said penalty amount, regardless of the number of claims or claimants.</P>

              <P>This bond is effective the __ day of __, __ and shall continue in effect until discharged or terminated as herein provided.

Such termination shall become effective thirty (30) days after receipt of said notice by the Commission. The Surety shall not be liable for any transportation-related activities of the Principal after the expiration of the 30-day period but such termination shall not affect the liability of the Principal and Surety for any event occurring prior to the date when said termination becomes effective.</P>
              <P>The Surety consents to be sued directly in respect of any bona fide claim owed by Principal for damages, reparations or penalties arising from the transportation-related activities under the Shipping Act of Principal in the event that such legal liability has not been discharged by the Principal or Surety after a claimant has obtained a final judgment (after appeal, if any) against the Principal from a United States Federal or State Court of competent jurisdiction and has complied with the procedures for collecting on such a judgment pursuant to 46 CFR 515.23, the Federal Maritime Commission, or where all parties and claimants otherwise mutually consent, from a foreign court, or where such claimant has become entitled to payment of a specified sum by virtue of a compromise settlement agreement made with the Principal and/or Surety pursuant to 46 CFR 515.23, whereby, upon payment of the agreed sum, the Surety is to be fully, irrevocably and unconditionally discharged from all further liability to such claimant; provided, however, that Surety's total obligation hereunder shall not exceed the amount set forth in 46 CFR 515.21, as applicable.</P>

              <P>Guaranty in Respect of Ocean Transportation Intermediary (OTI) Liability for Damages, Reparations or Penalties Arising from Transportation-Related Activities Under the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40101-41309) (Shipping Act).</P>
              <P>1. Whereas __ (Name of Applicant [indicate whether NVOCC or Freight Forwarder]) (hereinafter “Applicant”) is or may become an Ocean Transportation Intermediary (“OTI”) subject to the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40101-41309) and the rules and regulations of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), or is or may become a group or association of OTIs, and desires to establish its financial responsibility in accordance with section 19 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41107-41109), then, provided that the FMC shall have accepted, as sufficient for that purpose, the Applicant's application, supported by evidence of a financial rating for the Guarantor of Class V or higher under the Financial Size Categories of A.M. Best &amp; Company or equivalent from an acceptable international rating organization on such rating organization's letterhead or designated form, or, in the case of Guaranty provided by Underwriters at Lloyd's, documentation verifying membership in Lloyd's, or, in the case of surplus lines insurers, documentation verifying inclusion on a current “white list” issued by the Non-Admitted Insurers' Information Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the undersigned Guarantor certifies that it has sufficient and acceptable assets located in the United States to cover all damages arising from the transportation-related activities of the covered OTI as specified under the Shipping Act.</P>
              <P>2. Whereas, this Guaranty is written to ensure compliance by the Applicant with section 19 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 40901-40904), and the rules and regulations of the Federal Maritime Commission relating to evidence of financial responsibility for OTIs (46 CFR part 515), this guaranty shall be available to pay any judgment obtained or any settlement made pursuant to a claim under 46 CFR 515.23 for damages against the Applicant arising from the Applicant's transportation-related activities under the Shipping Act, or order for reparations issued pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41301-41302, 41305-41307(a)), or any penalty assessed against the Applicant pursuant to section 13 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41107-41109).</P>
              <P>3. Now, Therefore, The condition of this obligation is that the penalty amount of this Guaranty shall be available to pay any judgment obtained or any settlement made pursuant to a claim under 46 CFR 515.23 for damages against the Applicant arising from the Applicant's transportation-related activities or order for reparations issued pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41301-41302, 41305-41307(a)), or any penalty assessed against the Principal pursuant to section 13 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41107-41109).</P>

              <P>4. The undersigned Guarantor hereby consents to be sued directly in respect of any bona fide claim owed by Applicant for damages, reparations or penalties arising from Applicant's transportation-related activities under the Shipping Act, in the event that such legal liability has not been discharged by the Applicant after any such claimant has obtained a final judgment (after appeal, if any) against the Applicant from a United States Federal or State Court of competent jurisdiction and has complied with the procedures for collecting on such a judgment pursuant to 46 CFR 515.23, the FMC, or where all parties and claimants otherwise mutually <PRTPAGE P="167"/>consent, from a foreign court, or where such claimant has become entitled to payment of a specified sum by virtue of a compromise settlement agreement made with the Applicant and/or Guarantor pursuant to 46 CFR 515.23, whereby, upon payment of the agreed sum, the Guarantor is to be fully, irrevocably and unconditionally discharged from all further liability to such claimant. In the case of a guaranty covering the liability of a group or association of OTIs, Guarantor's obligation extends only to such damages, reparations or penalties described herein as are not covered by another insurance policy, guaranty or surety bond held by the OTI(s) against which a claim or final judgment has been brought.</P>
              <P>5. The Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty in respect to any claimant shall not exceed the amount of the guaranty; and the aggregate amount of the Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty shall not exceed the amount per OTI set forth in 46 CFR 515.21, or the amount per group or association of OTIs set forth in 46 CFR 515.21 in aggregate.</P>

              <P>6. The Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty shall attach only in respect of such activities giving rise to a cause of action against the Applicant, in respect of any of its transportation-related activities under the Shipping Act, occurring after the Guaranty has become effective, and before the expiration date of this Guaranty, which shall be the date thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of mail or email (<E T="03">bcl@fmc.gov</E>) written notice to the Director, Bureau of Certification and Licensing, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573, that either Applicant or the Guarantor has elected to terminate this Guaranty. The Guarantor and/or Applicant specifically agree to file such written notice of cancellation.</P>
              <P>7. Guarantor shall not be liable for payments of any of the damages, reparations or penalties hereinbefore described which arise as the result of any transportation-related activities of Applicant after the cancellation of the Guaranty, as herein provided, but such cancellation shall not affect the liability of the Guarantor for the payment of any such damages, reparations or penalties prior to the date such cancellation becomes effective.</P>
              <P>8. Guarantor shall pay, subject to the limit of the amount per OTI set forth in 46 CFR 515.21, directly to a claimant any sum or sums which Guarantor, in good faith, determines that the Applicant has failed to pay and would be held legally liable by reason of Applicant's transportation-related activities, or its legal responsibilities under the Shipping Act and the rules and regulations of the FMC, made by Applicant while this agreement is in effect, regardless of the financial responsibility or lack thereof, or the solvency or bankruptcy, of Applicant.</P>

              <P>9. The Applicant or Guarantor will promptly notify the Director, Bureau of Certification and Licensing, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573, in writing by mail or email (<E T="03">bcl@fmc.gov</E>), of all claims made, lawsuits filed, judgments rendered, and payments made under the Guaranty.</P>
              <P>10. Applicant and Guarantor agree to handle the processing and adjudication of claims by claimants under the Guaranty established herein in the United States, unless by mutual consent of all parties and claimants another country is agreed upon. Guarantor agrees to appoint an agent for service of process in the United States.</P>
              <P>11. This Guaranty shall be governed by the laws in the State of __ to the extent not inconsistent with the rules and regulations of the FMC.</P>
              <P>12. This Guaranty is effective the day of __, __, __ 12:01 a.m., standard time at the address of the Guarantor as stated herein and shall continue in force until terminated as herein provided.</P>

              <P>13. The Guarantor hereby designates as the Guarantor's legal agent for service of process domiciled in the United States __, with offices located in the United States at __, for the purposes of enforcing the Guaranty described herein.

              <P>Whereas, (Principal) __ operates as a group or association of OTIs in the waterborne foreign commerce of the United States <PRTPAGE P="168"/>and pursuant to section 19 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40901-40904), files this bond with the Federal Maritime Commission;</P>
              <P>Whereas, this group bond is written to ensure compliance by the OTIs, enumerated in Appendix A of this bond, with section 19 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 40901-40904), and the rules and regulations of the Federal Maritime Commission relating to evidence of financial responsibility for OTIs (46 CFR part 515), this group bond shall be available to pay any judgment obtained or any settlement made pursuant to a claim under 46 CFR 515.23 for damages against such OTIs arising from OTI transportation-related activities under the Shipping Act, or order for reparations issued pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41301-41302, 41305-41307(a)), or any penalty assessed against one or more OTI members pursuant to section 13 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41107-41109); provided, however, that the Surety's obligation for a group or association of OTIs shall extend only to such damages, reparations or penalties described herein as are not covered by another surety bond, insurance policy or guaranty held by the OTI(s) against which a claim or final judgment has been brought and that Surety's total obligation hereunder shall not exceed the amount per OTI provided for in 46 CFR 515.21 or the amount per group or association of OTIs provided for in 46 CFR 515.21 in aggregate.</P>

              <P>This group bond shall inure to the benefit of any and all persons who have obtained a judgment or made a settlement pursuant to a claim under 46 CFR 515.23 for damages against any or all of the OTIs identified in Appendix A not covered by said OTIs' insurance policy(ies), guaranty(ies) or surety bond(s) arising from said OTIs' transportation-related activities under the Shipping Act, or order for reparation issued pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act, and to the benefit of the Federal Maritime Commission for any penalty assessed against said OTIs pursuant to section 13 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C. 41107-41109).

An inland rate table may be constructed to provide an inland distance which is applied to a per mile rate to calculate the inland rate.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Shipper requests.</E> Conference tariffs shall contain clear and complete instructions, in accordance with the agreement's provisions, stating where and by what method shippers may file requests and complaints and how they may engage in consultation pursuant to section 5(b)(6) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 40303(b)(6)), together with a sample rate request form or a description of the information necessary for processing the request or complaint.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Search capability.</E> Tariffs shall provide the capability to search for tariff matter by non-case sensitive text search. Text search matches for commodity descriptions should result in a commodity or commodity index list.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Commodities and TRIs.</E> Retriever selection of a specific commodity from a commodity index list shall display the commodity description and provide an option for searching for a rate (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> on the basis of origin/destination) or a TRI list, if multiple TRIs are in effect for the commodity.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Object groups.</E> Retriever selection of a specific object group shall result in a list of the objects within the group or present a text search mechanism to <PRTPAGE P="178"/>allow location of an object within the group. For example, selection of the rules object group would present a list of the rules or a text search mechanism for locating specific terms or phrases within the rules.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Basic ocean freight.</E> The minimum rate display for tariffs shall consist of the basic ocean freight rate and a list of all assessorial charges that apply for the retriever-entered shipment parameters. If other rules or charges may be applicable to a shipment under certain circumstances, the tariff shall so indicate.</P>

A shipper-to-carrier relationship shall be presumed to exist where the receiving NVOCC issues a bill of lading to the tendering NVOCC for carriage of the co-loaded cargo.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Documentation requirements.</E> An NVOCC which tenders cargo to another NVOCC for co-loading, whether under a shipper-to-carrier or carrier-to-carrier relationship, shall annotate each applicable bill of lading with the identity of any other NVOCC to which the shipment has been tendered for co-loading. Such annotation shall be shown on the face of the bill of lading in a clear and legible manner.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Co-loading rates.</E> No NVOCC may offer special co-loading rates for the exclusive use of other NVOCCs. If cargo is accepted by an NVOCC from another NVOCC which tenders that cargo in the capacity of a shipper, it must be rated and carried under tariff provisions which are available to all shippers.</P>

This time-limited permission to correct an initial defective service contract filing is not to be used to make changes in the original service contract rates, terms or conditions that are otherwise provided for in paragraphs 530.10(b) and (c) of this section. The CT tab box in SERVCON must be checked at the time of resubmitting a previously filed service contract, and a description of the corrections made must be stated at the beginning of the corrected service contract in a comment box. Failure to check the CT box and enter a description of the correction will result in the rejection of a file with the same name, since documents with duplicate file names or service contract and amendment numbers are not accepted by SERVCON.</P>

This shall include adjustment necessitated by either liability for liquidated damages appearing in the service contract as filed with the Commission under § 530.8(b)(7), or the occurrence of an event described below in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>To register for filing, a carrier, conference, agreement or publisher must submit the Service Contract Registration Form (Form FMC-83) to BTCL. A separate Service Contract Registration Form is required for each individual that will file service contracts. BTCL will direct OIRM to provide approved filers with a log-on ID and password. Filers who wish a third party (publisher) to file their service contracts must so indicate on Form FMC-83. Authority for organizational filing can be transferred by submitting an amended registration form requesting the assignment of a new log-on ID and password. The original log-on ID will be canceled when a replacement log-on ID is issued. Log-on IDs and passwords may not be shared with, loaned to or used by any individual other than the individual registrant. The Commission reserves the right to disable any log-on ID that is shared with, loaned to or used by parties other than the registrant.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Filing</HD>
              <P>After receiving a log-on ID and a password, a filer may log-on to the service contract filing area on the Commission's home page and file service contracts. The filing screen will request such information as: filer name, Registered Persons Index (“RPI”) number and carrier RPI number (if different); Service Contract and amendment number; and effective date. The filer will attach the entire service contract file and submit it into the system. When the service contract has been submitted for filing, the system will assign a filing date and an FMC control number, both of which will be included in the acknowledgment/confirmation message.</P>

              <P>(3) Pursuant to § 531.12(b), the carrier party to the NSA must, upon written request by the Commission, provide the Commission with the associated records of the referenced terms. For the purpose of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the referenced terms will be deemed readily available to the Commission if the carrier party to the NSA provides the Commission with the associated records of the terms within thirty (30) days of the Commission's written request.</P>

              <P>(5) Except for the carrier party's rules tariff, the requirement in 46 U.S.C. 40501(a)-(c) that the NVOCC include its rates in a tariff open to public inspection in an automated tariff system and the Commission's corresponding regulations at 46 CFR part 520 shall not apply.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Format requirements.</E> Every NSA shall include:<PRTPAGE P="204"/>
              </P>

              <P>The rules in this part are issued pursuant to the authority of section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 19 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (“the Act”) (46 U.S.C. 305, 40101-40104, 40301-40307, 40501-40503, 40901-40904, 41101-41109, 41301-41302, and 41305-41307), and the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, Pub.

              <SECTNO>§ 535.102</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This part implements those provisions of the Act that govern agreements by or among ocean common carriers and agreements among marine terminal operators and among one or more marine terminal operators and one or more ocean common carriers. This part also sets forth more specifically certain procedures provided for in the Act.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 535.103</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Policies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Act requires that agreements be processed and reviewed, upon their initial filing, according to strict statutory deadlines. This part is intended to establish procedures for the orderly and expeditious review of filed agreements in accordance with the statutory requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) The Act requires that agreements be reviewed, upon their initial filing, to ensure compliance with all applicable provisions of the Act and empowers the Commission to obtain information to conduct that review. This part identifies those types of agreements that must be accompanied by information submissions when they are first filed, and sets forth the kind of information for certain agreements that the Commission believes relevant to that review. Only information that is relevant to such a review is requested. It is the policy of the Commission to keep the costs of regulation to a minimum and at the same time obtain information needed to fulfill its statutory responsibility.</P>
              <P>(c) To further the goal of expedited processing and review of agreements upon their initial filing, agreements are required to meet certain minimum requirements as to form. These requirements are intended to ensure expedited review and should assist parties in preparing agreements. These requirements as to form do not affect the substance of an agreement and are intended to allow parties the freedom to develop innovative commercial relationships and provide efficient and economic transportation systems.</P>

              <P>(d) The Act itself excludes certain agreements from the filing requirements and authorizes the Commission to exempt other classes of agreements from any requirement of the Act or <PRTPAGE P="209"/>this part. To minimize delay in the implementation of routine agreements and to avoid the private and public cost of unnecessary regulation, certain classes of agreements are exempt from the filing requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) Under the regulatory framework established by the Act, the role of the Commission as a monitoring agency has been enhanced. The Act favors greater freedom in allowing parties to form their commercial arrangements. This, however, requires greater monitoring of agreements after they have become effective to assure their continued compliance with all applicable provisions of the Act. The Act empowers the Commission to impose certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements. This part identifies those agreements that require specific record retention and reporting to the Commission and prescribes the applicable period of record retention, the form and content of such reporting, and the applicable time periods for filing with the Commission. Only information that is necessary to assure that the Commission's monitoring responsibilities will be fulfilled is requested.</P>
              <P>(f) The Act requires that conference agreements contain certain mandatory provisions. Each conference agreement must:</P>
              <P>(1) State its purpose;</P>
              <P>(2) Provide reasonable and equal terms and conditions for admission and readmission to membership;</P>
              <P>(3) Allow for withdrawal from membership upon reasonable notice without penalty;</P>
              <P>(4) Require an independent neutral body to police the conference, if requested by a member;</P>
              <P>(5) Prohibit conduct specified in sections 10(c)(1) or 10(c)(3) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 41105(1) or 41105(3));</P>
              <P>(6) Provide for a consultation process;</P>
              <P>(7) Establish procedures for considering shippers' requests and complaints; and</P>
              <P>(8) Provide for independent action.</P>
              <P>(g) To promote competitive and efficient transportation and a greater reliance on the marketplace, the Act places limits on carriers' agreements regarding service contracts. Carriers may not enter into an agreement to prohibit or restrict members from engaging in contract negotiations, may not require members to disclose service contract negotiations or terms and conditions (other than those required to be published), and may not adopt mandatory rules or requirements affecting the right of an agreement member or agreement members to negotiate and enter into contracts. However, agreement members may adopt voluntary guidelines covering the terms and procedures of members' contracts.</P>

              <P>(a) Upon written request of the filing party, the Commission may shorten the waiting period. In support of a request, the filing party should provide a full explanation, with reference to specific facts and circumstances, of the necessity for a shortened waiting period. In reviewing requests, the Commission will consider the parties' needs and the Commission's ability to complete its review of the agreement's potential impact. In no event, however, may the period be shortened to less than fourteen (14) days after the publication of the notice of the filing of the agreement in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> When a request for expedited review is denied, the normal 45-day waiting period will apply. Requests for expedited review will not be granted routinely and will be granted only on a showing of good cause. Good cause would include, but is not limited to, the impending expiration of the agreement; an operational urgency; Federal or State imposed time limitations; or other reasons that, in the Commission's discretion, constitute grounds for granting the request.</P>
              <P>(b) A request for expedited review will be considered for an agreement whose 45-day waiting period has begun anew after being stopped by a request for additional information.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requests for additional information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Commission may request from the filing party any additional information and documents necessary to complete the statutory review required by the Act. The request shall be made prior to the expiration of the 45-day waiting period. All responses to a request for additional information shall be submitted to the Director, Bureau of Trade Analysis, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573.</P>

              <P>(b) Where the Commission has made a request for additional information, the agreement's effective date will be 45 days after receipt of the complete response to the request for additional information. If all questions are not fully answered or requested documents are not supplied, the parties must include a statement of reasons why questions <PRTPAGE P="224"/>were not fully answered or documents supplied. In the event all material is not submitted, the agreement's effective date will be 45 days after receipt of both the documents and information which are submitted, if any, and the statement indicating the reasons for noncompliance. The Commission may, upon notice to the Attorney General, and pursuant to sections 6(i) and 6(k) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 41307(c) and 41307(d)), request the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to further extend the agreement's effective date until there has been substantial compliance.</P>
              <P>(c) A request for additional information may be made orally or in writing. In the case of an oral request, a written confirmation of the request shall be mailed to the filing party within seven days of the oral request.</P>
              <P>(d) The Commission will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that it has requested additional information and serve that notice on any commenting parties. The notice will indicate only that a request was made and will not specify what information is being sought. Interested parties will have fifteen (15) days after publication of the notice to file further comments on the agreement.</P>

              <P>(a) A failure to comply with a request for additional information results when a person filing an agreement, or an officer, director, partner, agent, or employee thereof fails to substantially respond to the request or does not file a satisfactory statement of reasons for noncompliance. An adequate response is one which directly addresses the Commission's request. When a response is not received by the Commission within a specified time, failure to comply will have occurred.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commission may, pursuant to section 6(i) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 41307(c)), request relief from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia when it considers that there has been a failure to substantially comply with a request for additional information. The Commission may request that the court:</P>
              <P>(1) Order compliance with the request;</P>
              <P>(2) Extend the review period until there has been substantial compliance; or</P>

              <P>(c) In accordance with the requirements and instructions in appendix B of this part, parties to an agreement subject to part 2(C) of section I of the Monitoring Report shall submit a narrative statement on any significant reductions in vessel capacity that the parties will implement under the agreement. The term “a significant reduction” is defined in appendix B.

              <P>(d)(1) The Commission may require, in its discretion, that the information on the top agreement commodities in part 4 of section II of the Monitoring Report be reported on a sub-trade basis, as defined in appendix B of this part, rather than on an agreement-wide basis. When commodity sub-trade information is required under this section, the Commission shall notify the parties to the agreement.</P>

              <P>(2) For purposes of § 535.703(d)(1), the top agreement commodities shall mean <PRTPAGE P="227"/>the top 10 liner commodities (including commodities not subject to tariff publication) carried by all the agreement parties in each sub-trade within the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter. Where the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and outbound sub-trades shall be stated separately. All other instructions, definitions, and terms shall apply as specified and required in appendix B of this part.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 535.801</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Independent action.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each conference agreement shall specify the independent action (“IA”) procedures of the conference, which shall provide that any conference member may take independent action on any rate or service item upon not more than 5 calendar days' notice to the conference and shall otherwise be in conformance with section 5(b)(8) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 40303(b)(8)).</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Each conference agreement that provides for a period of notice for independent action shall establish a fixed or maximum period of notice to the conference. A conference agreement shall not require or permit a conference member to give more than 5 calendar days' notice to the conference, except that in the case of a new or increased rate the notice period shall conform to the tariff publication requirements of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) A conference agreement shall not prescribe notice periods for adopting, withdrawing, postponing, canceling, or taking other similar actions on independent actions.</P>
              <P>(c) Each conference agreement shall indicate the conference official, single designated representative, or conference office to which notice of independent action is to be provided. A conference agreement shall not require notice of independent action to be given by the proposing member to the other parties to the agreement.</P>
              <P>(d) A conference agreement shall not require a member who proposes independent action to attend a conference meeting, to submit any further information other than that necessary to accomplish the publication of the independent tariff item, or to comply with any other procedure for the purpose of explaining, justifying, or compromising the proposed independent action.</P>
              <P>(e) A conference agreement shall specify that any new rate or service item proposed by a member under independent action (except for exempt commodities not published in the conference tariff) shall be included by the conference in its tariff for use by that member effective no later than 5 calendar days after receipt of the notice and by any other member that notifies the conference that it elects to adopt the independent rate or service item on or after its effective date.</P>

              <P>(f)(1) As it pertains to this part, “adopt” means the assumption in identical form of an originating member's independent action rate or service item, or a particular portion of such a rate or service item. If a carrier adopts an IA at a lower rate than the conference rate when there is less than 30 days remaining on the original IA, the adopted IA should be made to expire 30 days after its effectiveness to comply with the statutory 30-day notice requirement. In the case of an independent action time/volume rate (“IA <PRTPAGE P="229"/>TVR”), the dates of the adopting IA may vary from the dates of the original IA, so long as the duration of the adopting IA is the same as that of the originating IA. Furthermore, no term other than “adopt” (e.g., “follow,” “match”) can be used to describe the action of assuming as one's own an initiating carrier's IA. Additionally, if a party to an agreement chooses to take on an IA of another party, but alters it, such action is considered a new IA and must be published pursuant to the IA publication and notice provisions of the applicable agreement.</P>

              <P>(2) An IA TVR published by a member of a ratemaking agreement may be adopted by another member of the agreement, provided that the adopting member takes on the original IA TVR in its entirety without change to any aspect of the original rate offering (except beginning and ending dates in the time period) (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a separate TVR with a separate volume of cargo but for the same duration). Any subsequent IA TVR offering that results in a change in any aspect of the original IA TVR, other than the name of the offering carrier or the beginning date of the adopting IA TVR, is a new independent action and shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable agreement. The adoption procedures discussed above do not authorize the participation by an adopting carrier in the cargo volume of the originating carrier's IA TVR. Member lines may publish and participate in joint IA TVRs, if permitted to do so under the terms of their agreement; however, no carrier may participate in an IA TVR already published by another carrier.</P>
              <P>(g) A conference agreement shall not require or permit individual member lines to be assessed on a per carrier usage basis the costs and/or administrative expenses incurred by the agreement in processing independent action filings.</P>
              <P>(h) A conference agreement may not permit the conference to unilaterally designate an expiration date for an independent action taken by a member line. The right to determine the duration of an IA remains with the member line, and a member line must be given the opportunity to designate whatever duration it chooses for its IA, regardless if the duration is for a specified period or open ended. Only in instances where a member line gives its consent to the conference, or where a member line freely elects not to provide for the duration of its IA after having been given the opportunity, can the conference designate an expiration date for the member line's IA.</P>
              <P>(i) Any new conference agreement or any modification to an existing conference agreement that does not comply with the requirements of this section shall be rejected pursuant to § 535.601 of this part.</P>
              <P>(j) If ratemaking is by sections within a conference, then any notice to the conference required by § 535.801 may be made to the particular ratemaking section.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Information Form Instructions</HD>

              <P>1. All agreements and modifications to agreements between or among ocean common carriers identified in 46 CFR 535.502 must be accompanied by a completed Information Form to the full extent required in sections I through V of this Form. Sections I and V must be completed by all such agreements. In addition, sections II, III and IV must be completed, as applicable, in accordance with the authority contained in each agreement. Where an agreement containing multiple authorities is subject to duplicate reporting requirements in the various sections of this Form, the parties may provide only one response so long as the reporting requirements within each section are fully addressed. The Information Form specifies the data and information which must be reported for each section and the format in which it must be provided. If a party to an agreement is unable to supply a complete response to any item of this Form, that party shall provide either estimated data (with an explanation of why precise data are not available) or a detailed statement of reasons for noncompliance and the efforts made to obtain the required information. For purposes of this Form, if one of the agreement signatories is a joint service operating under an effective agreement, that signatory shall <PRTPAGE P="231"/>respond to the Form as a single agreement party.</P>

              <P>2. For clarification of the agreement terminology used in this Form, the parties may refer to the definitions provided in 46 CFR 535.104. In addition, the following definitions shall apply for purposes of this Form: <E T="03">liner movement</E> means the carriage of liner cargo by liner operators; <E T="03">liner cargo</E> means cargo carried on liner vessels in a liner service; <E T="03">liner operator</E> means a vessel-operating common carrier engaged in liner service; <E T="03">liner vessel</E> means a vessel used in a liner service; <E T="03">liner service</E> means a definite, advertised schedule of sailings at regular intervals; and <E T="03">TEU</E> means a unit of measurement equivalent to one 20-foot shipping container. Further, when used in this Form, the terms “entire geographic scope of the agreement” or “agreement-wide” refer to the combined U.S. inbound trade and/or the combined U.S. outbound trade as such trades apply to the geographic scope of the agreement, as opposed to the term “sub-trade,” which is defined for reporting purposes as the scope of all liner movements between each U.S. port range and each foreign country within the scope of the agreement. Whether required on a combined trade basis or a sub-trade basis, the U.S. inbound trade (or sub-trades) and the U.S. outbound trade (or sub-trades) shall always be stated separately.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section I</HD>
              <P>Section I applies to all agreements identified in 46 CFR 535.502. Parties to such agreements must complete parts 1 through 4 of this section.

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section II</HD>

              <P>Section II applies to agreements identified in 46 CFR 535.502(a) that contain any of the following authorities: a) the charter or use of vessel space in exchange for compensation or services; or b) the rationalization of sailings or services relating to a schedule of ports, the frequency of vessel calls at ports, or the size and capacity of vessels for deployment. Such authorities do not include the establishment of a “joint service,” nor “capacity <PRTPAGE P="232"/>rationalization” as these terms are defined in 46 CFR 535.104 (o) and (e). Parties to agreements identified in this section must complete all items in part 1.</P>

              <P>For the most recent 12-month period for which complete data are available, provide the number of vessel calls each party made at each port for its liner services that would be covered by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 1(B)</HD>
              <P>Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes, anticipated or planned to be implemented when the agreement goes into effect, in the number of vessel calls at a port for the parties' liner services that would be covered by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement. Specifically, explain the nature of the significant change and its effect on the frequency of vessel calls at the port for the liner service that would be subject to the change. For purposes of this part, a significant change refers to an increase or a decrease in the number of vessel calls at a port for a fixed, seasonally planned, or indefinite period of time. A significant change excludes an incidental or temporary alteration in the number of vessel calls at a port, or an operational change in vessel calls that would have little or no impact on the number of vessel calls at a port. If no significant change is anticipated or planned, it shall be noted with the term “none” in response to part 1(B) of this section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section III</HD>
              <P>Section III applies to agreements identified in 46 CFR 535.502 that contain the authority to discuss or agree on capacity rationalization as defined in 46 CFR 535.104(e). Parties to such agreements must complete parts 1 and 2 of this section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 1(A)</HD>
              <P>1. For the most recent calendar quarter for which complete data are available, provide the amount of vessel capacity for each party for each of its liner services that would be covered by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement, stated separately for the U.S. inbound and outbound trades as applicable to the geographic scope of the agreement. For purposes of this Form, vessel capacity means a party's total commercial liner space on line-haul vessels, whether operated by it or other parties from whom space is obtained, sailing to and/or from the continent of North America for each of its liner services that would be covered by the agreement.</P>
              <P>2. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was containerized, the amount(s) of vessel capacity for each party shall be reported in TEUs. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was non-containerized, the amount(s) of vessel capacity for each party shall be reported in non-containerized units of measurement. The unit of measurement used in calculating the amounts of non-containerized vessel capacity must be specified clearly and consistently applied.</P>

              <P>Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes, anticipated or planned to be implemented when the agreement goes into effect, in the amounts of vessel capacity for the parties' liner services that would be covered by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement. Specifically, explain the nature of and the reasons for the significant change and its effects on the liner service and the total amount of vessel capacity for such service that would be subject to the change. For purposes of this part, a significant change refers to the removal from or addition to a liner service of vessels or vessel space for a fixed, seasonally planned, or indefinite period of time. A significant change excludes instances when vessels may be temporarily repositioned or shifted from one service to another, or when vessel space may be temporarily altered, or when vessels are removed from a liner service and vessels of similar capacity are substituted. It also excludes operational changes in vessels or vessel space that would have little or no impact on the amount of vessel capacity offered in a liner service or a trade.

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section IV</HD>
              <P>Section IV applies to agreements identified in 46 CFR 535.502 that contain any of the following authorities: a) the discussion of, or agreement upon, whether on a binding basis under a common tariff or a non-binding basis, any kind of rate or charge; b) the establishment of a joint service; c) the pooling or division of cargo traffic, earnings, or revenues and/or losses; or d) the discussion of, or agreement on, any service contract matter. Parties to such agreements must complete parts 1 through 5 of this section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 1</HD>
              <P>1. For the most recent calendar quarter for which complete data are available, provide the market shares of all liner operators for the entire geographic scope of the agreement and in each sub-trade within the scope of the agreement. A joint service shall be treated as a single liner operator, whether it is an agreement line or a non-agreement line. Sub-trade is defined as the scope of all liner movements between each U.S. port range within the scope of the agreement and each foreign country within the scope of the agreement. Where the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and outbound market shares shall be shown separately.</P>
              <P>2. U.S. port ranges are defined as follows:</P>
              <P>a. Atlantic and Gulf—Includes ports along the eastern seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico from the northern boundary of Maine to Brownsville, Texas. Also includes all ports bordering upon the Great Lakes and their connecting waterways, all ports in the State of New York on the St. Lawrence River, and all ports in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</P>
              <P>b. Pacific—Includes all ports in the States of Alaska, Hawaii, California, Oregon, and Washington. Also includes all ports in Guam, American Samoa, Northern Marianas, Johnston Island, Midway Island, and Wake Island.</P>
              <P>3. An application may be filed for a waiver of the definition of “sub-trade” under the procedures described in 46 CFR 535.504. In any such application, the burden shall be on the parties to show that their marketing and pricing practices have been done by ascertainable multi-country regions rather than by individual countries or, in the case of the United States, by broader areas than the port ranges defined herein. The parties must further show that, though operating individually, they were nevertheless applying essentially similar regional practices.</P>
              <P>4. The formula for calculating market share in the entire agreement scope or in a sub-trade is as follows: The total amount of liner cargo carried on each liner operator's liner vessels in the entire agreement scope or in the sub-trade during the most recent calendar quarter for which complete data are available, divided by the total liner movements in the entire agreement scope or in the sub-trade during the same calendar quarter, which quotient is multiplied by 100. The calendar quarter used must be clearly identified. The market shares held by non-agreement lines as well as by agreement lines must be provided, stated separately in the format indicated.</P>
              <P>5. If 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by the parties in the entire agreement scope during the calendar quarter was containerized, only containerized liner movements (measured in TEUs) must be used for determining market share. If 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by the parties was non-containerized, only non-containerized liner movements must be used for determining market share. The unit of measurement used in calculating amounts of non-containerized cargo must be specified clearly and applied consistently.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 2</HD>

              <P>1. For each party that served all or any part of the geographic scope of the agreement during all or any part of the most recent 12-month period for which complete data are available, provide each party's total liner revenues within the geographic scope, total liner cargo carried within the geographic scope, and average revenue. For purposes of this Form, total liner revenues <PRTPAGE P="234"/>means the total revenues, in U.S. dollars, of each party corresponding to its total cargo carried for its liner services that would fall under the agreement, inclusive of all ocean freight charges, whether assessed on a port-to-port basis or a through intermodal basis; accessorial charges; surcharges; and charges for inland cargo carriage. Average revenue shall be calculated as the quotient of each party's total liner revenues within the geographic scope divided by its total cargo carried within the geographic scope.</P>
              <P>2. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the 12-month period was containerized, each party shall report only its total carryings of containerized liner cargo (measured in TEUs) within the geographic scope, total revenues generated by its carriage of containerized liner cargo, and average revenue per TEU. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the 12-month period was non-containerized, each party shall report only its total carryings of non-containerized liner cargo (specifying the unit of measurement used), total revenues generated by its carriage of non-containerized liner cargo, and average revenue per unit of measurement. When the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and outbound data shall be stated separately.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 3(A)</HD>
              <P>For the same 12-month period used in part 2 of this section, provide a list, for the entire geographic scope of the agreement, of the top 10 liner commodities (including commodities not subject to tariff publication) carried by all the parties for their liner services that would fall under the agreement. For purposes of this Form, commodities shall be identified at the 4-digit level of customarily used commodity coding schedules. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the 12-month period was containerized, this list shall include only containerized commodities. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the 12-month period was non-containerized, this list shall include only non-containerized commodities. When the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and outbound data shall be stated separately.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 3(B)</HD>
              <P>Provide the cargo volume and revenue results for each party for each of the major commodities listed in part 3(A) of this section, corresponding to the same 12-month period and unit of measurement used. For purposes of this Form, revenue results means the revenues, in U.S. dollars, earned by each party on the cargo volume of each major commodity listed in part 3(A) of this section, inclusive of all ocean freight charges, whether assessed on a port-to-port basis or a through intermodal basis; accessorial charges; surcharges; and charges for inland cargo carriage. If a party has no cargo volume and revenue results for a commodity listed in part 3(A) of this section, it shall be noted by using a zero for that party in response to part 3(B) of this section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 4(A)</HD>
              <P>For the same calendar quarter used in part 1 of this section, provide the amount of vessel capacity for each party for each of its liner services that would fall under the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement, stated separately for the U.S. inbound and outbound trades as applicable to the geographic scope of the agreement. For purposes of this Form, vessel capacity means a party's total commercial liner space on line-haul vessels, whether operated by it or other parties from whom space is obtained, sailing to and/or from the continent of North America for each of its liner services that would fall under the agreement. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was containerized, the amount(s) of vessel capacity for each party shall be reported in TEUs. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was non-containerized, the amount(s) of vessel capacity for each party shall be reported in non-containerized units of measurement. The unit of measurement used in calculating the amounts of non-containerized vessel capacity must be specified clearly and consistently applied.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 535—Monitoring Report and Instructions</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Monitoring Report Instructions</HD>
              <P>1. All agreements between or among ocean common carriers identified in 46 CFR 535.702(a) must submit completed Monitoring Reports to the full extent required in sections I through III of this Report. Sections I and II must be completed, as applicable, in accordance with the authority contained in each agreement. Section III must be completed by all agreements subject to Monitoring Report requirements.</P>
              <P>2. Where an agreement containing multiple authorities is subject to duplicate reporting requirements in the various sections of this Report, the parties may provide only one response so long as the reporting requirements within each section are fully addressed. The Monitoring Report specifies the data and information which must be reported for each section and the format in which it must be provided. If a party to an agreement is unable to supply a complete response to any item of this Report, that party shall provide either estimated data (with an explanation of why precise data are not available) or a detailed statement of reasons for noncompliance and the efforts made to obtain the required information. For purposes of this Report, if one of the agreement signatories is a joint service operating under an effective agreement, that signatory shall respond to the Report as a single agreement party.</P>

              <P>3. For clarification of the agreement terminology used in this Report, the parties may refer to the definitions provided in 46 CFR 535.104. In addition, the following definitions shall apply for purposes of this Report: <E T="03">liner movement</E> means the carriage of liner cargo by liner operators; <E T="03">liner cargo</E> means cargo carried on liner vessels in a liner service; <E T="03">liner operator</E> means a vessel-operating common carrier engaged in liner service; <E T="03">liner vessel</E> means a vessel used in a liner service; <E T="03">liner service</E> means a definite, advertised schedule of sailings at regular intervals; and TEU means a unit of measurement equivalent to one 20-foot shipping container. Further, when used in this Report, the terms “entire geographic scope of the agreement” or “agreement-wide” refer to the combined U.S. inbound trade and/or the combined U.S. outbound trade as such trades apply to the geographic scope of the agreement, as opposed to the term “sub-trade,” which is defined for reporting purposes as the scope of all liner movements between each U.S. port range and each foreign country within the scope of the agreement. Whether required on a combined trade basis or a sub-trade basis, the U.S. inbound trade (or sub-trades) and the U.S. outbound trade (or sub-trades) shall always be stated separately.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section I</HD>

              <P>Section I applies to agreements, identified in 46 CFR 535.702(a)(1), that contain the authority to discuss or agree on capacity rationalization as defined in 46 CFR 535.104(e). Parties to such agreements must complete parts 1 through 3 of this section.<PRTPAGE P="239"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 1</HD>
              <P>State the full name of the agreement and the agreement number assigned by the FMC.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 2(A)</HD>
              <P>1. For the preceding calendar quarter, provide the amount of vessel capacity for each party for each of its liner services that is covered by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement, stated separately for the U.S. inbound and outbound trades as applicable to the geographic scope of the agreement. For purposes of this Report, vessel capacity means a party's total commercial liner space on line-haul vessels, whether operated by it or other parties from whom space is obtained, sailing to and/or from the continent of North America for each of its liner services that is covered by the agreement.</P>
              <P>2. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was containerized, the amount(s) of vessel capacity for each party shall be reported in TEUs. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was non-containerized, the amount(s) of vessel capacity for each party shall be reported in non-containerized units of measurement. The unit of measurement used in calculating the amounts of non-containerized vessel capacity must be specified clearly and consistently applied.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 2(B)</HD>
              <P>For the preceding calendar quarter, provide the percentage of vessel capacity utilization for each party for each of its liner services that is covered by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement, corresponding to the figures used in part 2(A) of this section, stated separately for the U.S. inbound and outbound trades as applicable to the geographic scope of the agreement. For purposes of this Report, the percentage of vessel capacity utilization means a party's total volume of liner cargo, for each of its liner services that is covered by the agreement, carried on any vessel space counted under part 2(A) of this section, divided by its total vessel capacity as defined and derived in part 2(A) of this section, which quotient is multiplied by 100.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 2(C)</HD>
              <P>Provide a narrative statement on any significant reductions, to be implemented under the agreement, in the amounts of vessel capacity for the parties' liner services that are covered by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement. Specifically, explain the nature of and the reasons for the significant reduction and its effects on the liner service and the total amount of vessel capacity for such service that would be subject to the reduction. The narrative statement for part 2(C) of this section shall be submitted to the Director, Bureau of Trade Analysis, no later than 15 days after a significant reduction in the amount of vessel capacity has been agreed upon by the parties but prior to the implementation of the actual reduction under the agreement. For purposes of this part, a significant reduction refers to the removal from a liner service of vessels or vessel space for a fixed, seasonally planned, or indefinite period of time. A significant reduction excludes instances when vessels may be temporarily repositioned or shifted from one service to another, or when vessel space may be temporarily altered, or when vessels are removed from a liner service and vessels of similar or greater capacity are substituted. It also excludes operational changes in vessels or vessel space that would have little or no impact on the amount of vessel capacity offered in a liner service or a trade.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 2(D)</HD>
              <P>Excluding those changes already reported in part 2(C) of this section, provide a narrative statement on any other significant changes, implemented under the agreement during the preceding calendar quarter, in the amounts of vessel capacity for the parties' liner services that are covered by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement. Specifically, explain the nature of and the reasons for the significant change and its effects on the liner service and the total amount of vessel capacity for such service that was subject to the change. For purposes of this part, a significant change refers to the addition to a liner service of vessels or vessel space for a fixed, seasonally planned, or indefinite period of time. A significant change excludes instances when vessels were temporarily repositioned or shifted from one service to another, or when vessel space was temporarily altered, or when vessels were removed from a liner service and vessels of similar capacity were substituted. It also excludes operational changes in vessels or vessel space that had little or no impact on the amount of vessel capacity offered in a liner service or a trade. If no significant change was implemented, it shall be noted with the term “none” in response to part 2(D) of this section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 3</HD>

              <P>Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes, implemented under the agreement during the calendar quarter, in the number of vessel calls at a port for the parties' liner services that are covered by the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement. Specifically, explain <PRTPAGE P="240"/>the nature of the significant change and its effect on the frequency of vessel calls at the port for the liner service that was subject to the change. For purposes of this part, a significant change refers to an increase or a decrease in the number of vessel calls at a port for a fixed, seasonally planned, or indefinite period of time. A significant change excludes an incidental or temporary alteration in the number of vessel calls at a port, or an operational change in vessel calls that had little or no impact on the number of vessel calls at a port. If no significant change was implemented, it shall be noted with the term “none” in response to part 3 of this section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section II</HD>
              <P>Section II applies to agreements, identified in 46 CFR 535.702(a)(2), where the parties to the agreement hold a combined market share, based on cargo volume, of 35 percent or more in the entire U.S. inbound or outbound geographic scope of the agreement and the agreement contains any of the following authorities: a) the discussion of, or agreement upon, whether on a binding basis under a common tariff or a non-binding basis, any kind of rate or charge; b) the establishment of a joint service; c) the pooling or division of cargo traffic, earnings, or revenues and/or losses; or d) the discussion of, or agreement on, any service contract matter. Parties to such agreements must complete parts 1 through 6 of this section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 1</HD>
              <P>State the full name of the agreement and the agreement number assigned by the FMC.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 2</HD>
              <P>1. For the preceding calendar quarter, provide the market shares of all liner operators for the entire geographic scope of the agreement and in each sub-trade within the scope of the agreement. A joint service shall be treated as a single liner operator, whether it is an agreement line or a non-agreement line. Sub-trade is defined as the scope of all liner movements between each U.S. port range within the scope of the agreement and each foreign country within the scope of the agreement. Where the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and outbound market shares shall be shown separately.</P>
              <P>2. U.S. port ranges are defined as follows:</P>
              <P>a. Atlantic and Gulf—Includes ports along the eastern seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico from the northern boundary of Maine to Brownsville, Texas. Also includes all ports bordering upon the Great Lakes and their connecting waterways, all ports in the State of New York on the St. Lawrence River, and all ports in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</P>
              <P>b. Pacific—Includes all ports in the States of Alaska, Hawaii, California, Oregon, and Washington. Also includes all ports in Guam, American Samoa, Northern Marianas, Johnston Island, Midway Island, and Wake Island.</P>
              <P>3. An application may be filed for a waiver of the definition of “sub-trade” under the procedures described in 46 CFR 535.705. In any such application, the burden shall be on the parties to show that their marketing and pricing practices have been done by ascertainable multi-country regions rather than by individual countries or, in the case of the United States, by broader areas than the port ranges defined herein. The Commission will also consider whether the alternative definition of “sub-trade” requested by the waiver application is reasonably consistent with the definition of “sub-trade” applied in the original Information Form for the agreement.</P>
              <P>4. The formula for calculating market share in the entire agreement scope or in a sub-trade is as follows: The total amount of liner cargo carried on each liner operator's liner vessels in the entire agreement scope or in the sub-trade during the most recent calendar quarter for which complete data are available, divided by the total liner movements in the entire agreement scope or in the sub-trade during the same calendar quarter, which quotient is multiplied by 100. The market shares held by non-agreement lines as well as by agreement lines must be provided, stated separately in the format indicated.</P>
              <P>5. If 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by the parties in the entire agreement scope during the calendar quarter was containerized, only containerized liner movements (measured in TEUs) must be used for determining market share. If 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by the parties was non-containerized, only non-containerized liner movements must be used for determining market share. The unit of measurement used in calculating amounts of non-containerized cargo must be specified clearly and applied consistently.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 3</HD>

              <P>1. For the preceding calendar quarter, provide each party's total liner revenues in the entire geographic scope of the agreement, total liner cargo carried in the entire geographic scope of the agreement, and average revenue. For purposes of this Report, total liner revenues means the total revenues, in U.S. dollars, of each party corresponding to its total cargo carried for its liner services that fall under the agreement, inclusive of all ocean freight charges, whether assessed on a port-to-port basis or a through intermodal basis; accessorial charges; surcharges; and charges for inland cargo carriage. Average revenue shall be calculated as the quotient of each party's total liner revenues <PRTPAGE P="241"/>in the entire geographic scope divided by its total cargo carried in the entire geographic scope.</P>
              <P>2. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was containerized, each party shall report only its total carryings of containerized liner cargo (measured in TEUs) during the calendar quarter, total revenues generated by its carriage of containerized liner cargo, and average revenue per TEU. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was non-containerized, each party shall report only its total carryings of non-containerized liner cargo during the calendar quarter (specifying the unit of measurement used), total revenues generated by its carriage of non-containerized liner cargo, and average revenue per unit of measurement. When the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and outbound data shall be stated separately.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 4(A)</HD>
              <P>For the preceding calendar quarter, provide a list, for the entire geographic scope of the agreement, of the top 10 liner commodities (including commodities not subject to tariff publication) carried by all the parties for their liner services that fall under the agreement. For purposes of this Report, commodities shall be identified at the 4-digit level of customarily used commodity coding schedules. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was containerized, this list shall include only containerized commodities. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was non-containerized, this list shall include only non-containerized commodities. When the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and outbound data shall be stated separately.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 4(B)</HD>
              <P>For the preceding calendar quarter, provide the cargo volume and revenue results for each party for each of the major commodities listed in part 4(A) of this section, corresponding to the same unit of measurement used. For purposes of this Report, revenue results means the revenues, in U.S. dollars, earned by each party on the cargo volume of each major commodity listed in part 4(A) of this section, inclusive of all ocean freight charges, whether assessed on a port-to-port basis or a through intermodal basis; accessorial charges; surcharges; and charges for inland cargo carriage. If a party has no cargo volume and revenue results for a commodity listed in part 4(A) of this section, it shall be noted by using a zero for that party in response to part 4(B) of this section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 5(A)</HD>
              <P>For the preceding calendar quarter, provide the amount of vessel capacity for each party for each of its liner services that falls under the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement, stated separately for the U.S. inbound and outbound trades as applicable to the geographic scope of the agreement. For purposes of this Report, vessel capacity means a party's total commercial liner space on line-haul vessels, whether operated by it or other parties from whom space is obtained, sailing to and/or from the continent of North America for each of its liner services that falls under the agreement. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was containerized, the amount(s) of vessel capacity for each party shall be reported in TEUs. When 50 percent or more of the total liner cargo carried by all the parties in the geographic scope of the agreement during the calendar quarter was non-containerized, the amount(s) of vessel capacity for each party shall be reported in non-containerized units of measurement. The unit of measurement used in calculating the amounts of non-containerized vessel capacity must be specified clearly and consistently applied.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 5(B)</HD>
              <P>For the preceding calendar quarter, provide the percentage of vessel capacity utilization for each party for each of its liner services that falls under the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement, corresponding to the figures used in part 5(A) of this section, stated separately for the U.S. inbound and outbound trades as applicable to the geographic scope of the agreement. For purposes of this Report, the percentage of vessel capacity utilization means a party's total volume of liner cargo, for each of its liner services that falls under the agreement, carried on any vessel space counted under part 5(A) of this section, divided by its total vessel capacity as defined and derived in part 5(A) of this section, which quotient is multiplied by 100.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 5(C)</HD>

              <P>Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes in the amount of vessel capacity that occurred during the preceding calendar quarter for the parties' liner services that fall under the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement. Specifically, explain the nature of and the <PRTPAGE P="242"/>reasons for the significant change and its effects on the liner service and the total amount of vessel capacity for such service that was subject to the change. For purposes of this part, a significant change refers to the removal from or addition to a liner service of vessels or vessel space for a fixed, seasonally planned, or indefinite period of time. A significant change would exclude instances when vessels were temporarily repositioned or shifted from one service to another, or when vessel space was temporarily altered, or when vessels were removed from a liner service and vessels of similar capacity were substituted. It also excludes operational changes in vessels and vessel space that had little or no impact on the amount of vessel capacity offered in a liner service or a trade. If no significant change occurred during the calendar quarter, it shall be noted with the term “none” in response to part 5(C) of this section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 6</HD>
              <P>Provide a narrative statement on any significant changes in the number of vessel calls at a port that occurred during the preceding calendar quarter for the parties' liner services that fall under the agreement within the entire geographic scope of the agreement. Specifically, explain the nature of the significant change and its effect on the frequency of vessel calls at the port for the liner service that was subject to the change. For purposes of this part, a significant change refers to an increase or a decrease in the number of vessel calls at a port for a fixed, seasonally planned, or indefinite period of time. A significant change excludes an incidental or temporary alteration in the number of vessel calls at a port, or an operational change in vessel calls that had little or no impact on the number of vessel calls at a port. If no significant change occurred during the calendar quarter, it shall be noted with the term “none” in response to part 6 of this section.</P>

Copies of Form FMC-131 may be obtained from the Commission's Web site at <E T="03">http://www.fmc.gov,</E> or from the Bureau of Certification and Licensing, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573.</P>
              <P>(b) An application for a Certificate (Performance) shall be filed with the Bureau of Certification and Licensing, Federal Maritime Commission, by the vessel owner or charterer at least 60 days in advance of the arranging, offering, advertising, or providing of any water transportation or tickets in connection therewith except that any person other than the owner or charterer who arranges, offers, advertises, or provides passage on a vessel may apply for a Certificate (Performance). Late filing of the application will be permitted without penalty only for good cause shown.</P>
              <P>(c) All applications and evidence required to be filed with the Commission shall be in English, and any monetary terms shall be expressed in terms of U.S. currency.</P>
              <P>(d) The Commission shall have the privilege of verifying any statements made or any evidence submitted under the rules of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(e) An application for a Certificate (Performance), excluding an application for the addition or substitution of a vessel to the applicant's fleet, must be accompanied by a filing fee remittance of $3,272. An application for a Certificate (Performance) for the addition or substitution of a vessel to the applicant's fleet must be accompanied by a filing fee remittance of $1,652.

              <P>(f) The application shall be signed by a duly authorized officer or representative of the applicant with a copy of evidence of his or her authority.</P>
              <P>(g) In the event of any material change in the facts as reflected in the application, an amendment to the application shall be filed no later than fifteen (15) days following such change. For the purpose of this subpart, a material change shall be one which:</P>
              <P>(1) Results in a decrease in the amount submitted to establish financial responsibility to a level below that required to be maintained under the rules of this subpart, or</P>

              <P>Except as provided in § 540.9(j), the amount of coverage required under this section and § 540.6(b) shall be in an amount determined by the Commission <PRTPAGE P="247"/>to be no less than 110 percent of the unearned passenger revenue of the applicant on the date within the two fiscal years immediately prior to the filing of the application which reflects the greatest amount of unearned passenger revenue. The Commission, for good cause shown, may consider a time period other than the previous two-fiscal-year requirement in this section or other methods acceptable to the Commission to determine the amount of coverage required. Evidence of adequate financial responsibility for the purposes of this subpart may be established by one or a combination (including § 540.6 Surety Bonds) of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(a) Filing with the Commission evidence of insurance, issued by an insurer, providing coverage for indemnification of passengers in the event of the nonperformance of water transportation.</P>
              <P>(1) Termination or cancellation of the evidence of insurance, whether by the assured or by the insurer, and whether for nonpayment of premiums, calls or assessments or for other cause, shall not be effected: (i) Until notice in writing has been given to the assured or to the insurer and to the Bureau of Certification and Licensing at its office in Washington, DC 20573, by certified mail or courier service, (ii) until after 30 days expire from the date notice is actually received by the Commission, or until after the Commission revokes the Certificate (Performance), whichever occurs first. Notice of termination or cancellation to the assured or insurer shall be simultaneous to such notice given to the Commission. The insurer shall remain liable for claims covered by said evidence of insurance arising by virtue of an event which had occurred prior to the effective date of said termination or cancellation. No such termination or cancellation shall become effective while a voyage is in progress.</P>
              <P>(2) The insolvency or bankruptcy of the assured shall not constitute a defense to the insurer as to claims included in said evidence of insurance and in the event of said insolvency or bankruptcy, the insurer agrees to pay any unsatisfied final judgments obtained on such claims.</P>
              <P>(3) No insurance shall be acceptable under these rules which restricts the liability of the insurer where privity of the owner or charterer has been shown to exist.</P>
              <P>(4) Paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section shall apply to the guaranty as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Filing with the Commission evidence of an escrow account, acceptable to the Commission, for indemnification of passengers in the event of nonperformance of water transportation. Parties filing escrow agreements for Commission approval may execute such agreements in the form set forth in appendix A of subpart A of this part.</P>

              <P>(c) Filing with the Commission a guaranty on Form FMC-133A, by a Protection and Indemnity Association with established assets, reserves and reinsurance acceptable to the Commission, for indemnification of passengers in the event of nonperformance of water transportation. The requirements of Form FMC-133A, however, may be amended by the Commission in a particular case for good cause. Copies of Form FMC-133A may be obtained from the Commission's Web site at <E T="03">http://www.fmc.gov</E> or from the Bureau of Certification and Licensing.</P>

              <P>(d) Revenues derived from whole-ship charters, as defined in § 540.2(l), may be exempted from consideration as unearned passenger revenues, on condition that, in the case of a new operator or within 30 days of the execution of the whole-ship charter if the operator has a Performance Certificate for the vessel in question: (1) A certified true copy of the contract or charter is furnished with the application; (2) The chartering party attests that it will redistribute the vessel's passenger accommodations without charge; and (3) A document executed by the chartering party's Chief Executive Officer or other responsible corporate officer is submitted by which the chartering party specifically acknowledges that its rights to indemnification under section 3 of Public Law 89-777 (46 U.S.C. 44101-44102, 44104-44106) may be affected by the reduction in section 3, Public Law <PRTPAGE P="248"/>89-777, financial responsibility coverage attributable to the exclusion of such funds from the operator's UPR.</P>

              <P>(a) Where financial responsibility is not established under § 540.5, a surety bond shall be filed on Form FMC-132A. Such surety bond shall be issued by a bonding company authorized to do business in the United States and acceptable to the Commission for indemnification of passengers in the event of nonperformance of water transportation. The requirements of Form FMC-132A, however, may be amended by the Commission in a particular case for good cause. Copies of Form FMC-132A may be obtained from the Commission's Web site at <E T="03">http://www.fmc.gov</E> or from the Bureau of Certification and Licensing.</P>
              <P>(b) In the case of a surety bond which is to cover all passenger operations of the applicant subject to these rules, such bond shall be in an amount calculated as in the introductory text of § 540.5.</P>
              <P>(c) In the case of a surety bond which is to cover an individual voyage, such bond shall be in an amount determined by the Commission to equal the gross passenger revenue for that voyage.</P>
              <P>(d) The liability of the surety under the rules of this subpart to any passenger shall not exceed the amount paid by any such passenger, except that, no such bond shall be terminated while a voyage is in progress.</P>

If the applicant, within 20 days after the receipt of such notice, requests a hearing to show that the evidence of financial responsibility filed with the Commission does meet the rules of this subpart, such hearing shall be granted by the Commission. Regardless of a hearing, a Certificate (Performance) shall become null and void upon cancellation or termination of the surety bond, evidence of insurance, guaranty, or escrow account.</P>
              <P>(b) A Certificate (Performance) may be denied, revoked, suspended, or modified for any of the following reasons:</P>

              <P>(j) The amount of: the insurance as specified in § 540.5(a), the escrow account as specified in § 540.5(b), the guaranty as specified in § 540.5(c), or the surety bond as specified in § 540.6 shall not be required to exceed $15 million for one year after April 2, 2013. Twelve (12) months after April 2, 2013, the amount shall not exceed $22 million, and twenty four (24) months after April 2, 2013, the amount shall not exceed $30 million. Every two years, on the anniversary after the cap on required financial responsibility reaches $30 million, the cap shall automatically adjust to the nearest $1 million based on changes as reflected in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index. The Bureau of Certification and Licensing will determine the amount of each adjustment and transmit that information to the Secretary of the Federal Maritime Commission for publication on the Commission's Web site (<E T="03">www.fmc.gov</E>) and in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> with an effective date that is no less than sixty (60) days after <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication.</P>

              <P>(k) Every person in whose name a Certificate (Performance) has been issued shall be deemed to be responsible for any unearned passage money or deposits held by its agents or any other person authorized by the <PRTPAGE P="250"/>certificant to sell the certificant's tickets. Certificants shall promptly notify the Commission of any arrangements, including charters and subcharters, made by it or its agent with any person pursuant to which the certificant does not assume responsibility for all passenger fares and deposits collected by such person or organization and held by such person or organization as deposits or payment for services to be performed by the certificant. If responsibility is not assumed by the certificant, the certificant also must inform such person or organization of the certification requirements of Public Law 89-777 and not permit use of its vessel, name or tickets in any manner unless and until such person or organization has obtained the requisite Certificate (Performance) from the Commission. Failure to follow the procedures in this paragraph means the certificant shall retain full financial responsibility for indemnification of passengers for nonperformance of the transportation.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Requests to substitute alternative financial responsibility.</E> (1) A certificant whose unearned passenger revenue at no time for the two immediately prior fiscal years has exceeded 150% of the required cap may submit a request to the Director, Bureau of Certification and Licensing, to substitute alternative forms of financial protection to evidence the financial responsibility as otherwise provided in this part.</P>
              <P>(2) The Commission will consider such requests on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(3) The request must include copies of the requesting PVO's most recently available annual and quarterly financial and income statements. Other documents and information in support of its request may also be submitted.</P>
              <P>(4) For requests based upon the already existing protections available to credit card purchases of passenger vessel transportation, the requesting PVO must supply the following information for the most recent twelve months preceding the request: Total deposits and payments received for passenger vessel transportation; Credit card receipt totals; Copy of the PVO's policy(ies) governing payments by passengers (i.e., deposits and the number of days prior to sailing the passenger must make final payment).</P>
              <P>(5) In determining whether and to what level to reduce the required amount, the Commission may consider the extent to which other statutory requirements provide relevant protections, the certificant's financial data, and other specific facts and circumstances.</P>
              <P>(6) For PVOs with payment policies that provide for final payment for the passenger vessel transportation no later than 60 days before the vessel's sailing date, requests based upon credit card receipts may be granted by the Commission permitting a reduction in the financial responsibility otherwise required under this Part. The amount of such a reduction will be established by determining the proportion that the PVO's total credit card receipts bears to its total receipts and applying one half of that percentage to the PVO's highest two-year UPR.</P>
              <P>(7) The Bureau of Certification and Licensing may request additional information as may assist it in considering the request.</P>
              <P>(8) Where a request is granted, the alternative financial responsibility shall remain in effect until the PVO's Certificate (Performance) expires under § 540.7(b) or until the Director, Bureau of Certification and Licensing determines otherwise based upon changing information pursuant to this paragraph or paragraph (l)(5) of this section. Additional information may be requested at any time by the Commission or BCL from a PVO whose request under this section has been granted.</P>

              <P>Know all men by these presents, that we __________ (Name of applicant), of ________ (City), ________ (State and country), as Principal (hereinafter called <PRTPAGE P="251"/>Principal), and ________ (Name of surety), a company created and existing under the laws of ______ (State and country) and authorized to do business in the United States as Surety (hereinafter called Surety) are held and firmly bound unto the United States of America in the penal sum of ________, for which payment, well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents. Whereas the Principal intends to become a holder of a Certificate (Performance) pursuant to the provisions of subpart A of part 540 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations and has elected to file with the Federal Maritime Commission such a bond to insure financial responsibility and the supplying transportation and other services subject to subpart A of part 540 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, in accordance with the ticket contract between the Principal and the passenger, and</P>
              <P>Whereas this bond is written to assure compliance by the Principal as an authorized holder of a Certificate (Performance) pursuant to subpart A of part 540 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, and shall inure to the benefit of any and all passengers to whom the Principal may be held legally liable for any of the damages herein described. Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if the Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to passengers any sum or sums for which the Principal may be held legally liable by reason of the Principal's failure faithfully to provide such transportation and other accommodations and services in accordance with the ticket contract made by the Principal and the passenger while this bond is in effect for the supplying of transportation and other services pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of subpart A of part 540 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise, to remain in full force and effect.</P>
              <P>The liability of the Surety with respect to any passenger shall not exceed the passage price paid by or on behalf of such passenger. The liability of the Surety shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder, unless and until such payment or payments shall amount in the aggregate to the penalty of the bond, but in no event shall the Surety's obligation hereunder exceed the amount of said penalty. The Surety agrees to furnish written notice to the Federal Maritime Commission forthwith of all suits filed, judgments rendered, and payments made by said Surety under this bond.</P>
              <P>This bond is effective the ______ day of ________, 20__, 12:01 a.m., standard time at the address of the Principal as stated herein and shall continue in force until terminated as hereinafter provided. The Principal or the Surety may at any time terminate this bond by written notice sent by certified mail, courier service, or other electronic means such as email and fax to the other and to the Federal Maritime Commission at its office in Washington, DC, such termination to become effective thirty (30) days after actual receipt of said notice by the Commission, except that no such termination shall become effective while a voyage is in progress. The Surety shall not be liable hereunder for any refunds due under ticket contracts made by the Principal for the supplying of transportation and other services after the termination of this bond as herein provided, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the Surety hereunder for refunds arising from ticket contracts made by the Principal for the supplying of transportation and other services prior to the date such termination becomes effective.</P>
              <P>The underwriting Surety will promptly notify the Director, Bureau of Certification and Licensing, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573, of any claim(s) or disbursements against this bond.</P>

              <P>1. Whereas ________ (Name of applicant) (Hereinafter referred to as the “Applicant”) is the Owner or Charterer of the passenger Vessel(s) specified in the annexed Schedule (“the Vessels”'), which are or may become engaged in voyages to or from United States ports, and the Applicant desires to establish its financial responsibility in accordance with section 3 of Pub.

              <P>2. The Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty in respect to any passenger shall not exceed the amount paid by such passenger; and the aggregate amount of the Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty shall not exceed $______.</P>
              <P>3. The Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty shall attach only in respect of events giving rise to a cause of action against the Applicant, in respect of any of the Vessels, for nonperformance of transportation within the meaning of Section 3 of the Act, occurring after the Certificate has been granted to the Applicant, and before the expiration date of this Guaranty, which shall be the earlier of the following dates:</P>
              <P>(a) The date whereon the Certificate is withdrawn, or for any reason becomes invalid or ineffective; or</P>
              <P>(b) The date 30 days after the date of receipt by FMC of notice in writing delivered by certified mail, courier service or other electronic means such as email and fax, that the Guarantor has elected to terminate this Guaranty except that: (i) If, on the date which would otherwise have been the expiration date under the foregoing provisions (a) or (b) of this Clause 3, any of the Vessels is on a voyage whereon passengers have been embarked at a United States port, then the expiration date of this Guaranty shall, in respect of such Vessel, be postponed to the date on which the last passenger on such voyage shall have finally disembarked; and (ii) Such termination shall not affect the liability of the Guarantor for refunds arising from ticket contracts made by the Applicant for the supplying of transportation and other services prior to the date such termination becomes effective.</P>
              <P>4. If, during the currency of this Guaranty, the Applicant requests that a vessel owned or operated by the Applicant, and not specified in the annexed Schedule, should become subject to this Guaranty, and if the Guarantor accedes to such request and so notifies FMC in writing or other electronic means such as email and fax, then, provided that within 30 days of receipt of such notice, FMC shall have granted a Certificate, such Vessel shall thereupon be deemed to be one of the Vessels included in the said Schedule and subject to this Guaranty.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">ESCROW AGREEMENT</HD>
              <P>THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT, made as of this __ day of (month &amp; year), by and between (Customer), a corporation/company having a place of business at (“Customer”) _________________ and (Banking Institution name &amp; address) a banking corporation, having a place of business at (“Escrow Agent”).</P>
              <P>Witnesseth:</P>

              <P>WHEREAS, Customer wishes to establish an escrow account in order to provide for the indemnification of passengers in the event of <PRTPAGE P="253"/>non-performance of water transportation to which such passengers would be entitled, and to establish Customer's financial responsibility therefore; and</P>
              <P>WHEREAS, Escrow Agent wishes to act as Escrow Agent of the escrow account established hereunder;</P>
              <P>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:</P>
              <P>1. Customer has established on (month, &amp; year) (the “Commencement Date”) an escrow account with the Escrow Agent which escrow account shall hereafter be governed by the terms of this Agreement (the “Escrow Account”). Escrow Agent shall maintain the Escrow Account in its name, in its capacity as Escrow Agent.</P>
              <P>2. Customer will determine, as of the date prior to the Commencement Date, the amount of unearned passenger revenue, including any funds to be transferred from any predecessor Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall have no duty to calculate the amount of unearned passenger revenue. Unearned Passenger Revenues are defined as that passenger revenue received for water transportation and all other accommodations, services and facilities relating thereto not yet performed. 46 CFR 540.2(i).</P>
              <P>3. Customer will deposit on the Commencement Date into the Escrow Account cash in an amount equal to the amount of Unearned Passenger Revenue determined under Paragraph 2 above plus a cash amount (“the Fixed Amount”) equal to (10 percent of the Customer's highest Unearned Passenger Revenue for the prior two fiscal years. For periods on or after (year of agreement (2009)), the Fixed Amount shall be determined by the Commission on an annual basis, in accordance with 46 CFR Part 540.</P>
              <P>4. Customer acknowledges and agrees that until such time as a cruise has been completed and Customer has taken the actions described herein, Customer shall not be entitled, nor shall it have any interest in any funds deposited with Escrow Agent to the extent such funds represent Unearned Passenger Revenue.</P>
              <P>5. Customer may, at any time, deposit additional funds consisting exclusively of Unearned Passenger Revenue and the Fixed Amount, into the Escrow Account and Escrow Agent shall accept all such funds for deposit and shall manage all such funds pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.</P>
              <P>6. After the establishment of the Escrow Account, as provided in Paragraph 1, Customer shall on a weekly basis on each (identify day of week), or if Customer or Escrow Agent is not open for business on (identify day of week) then on the next business day that Customer and Escrow Agent are open for business recompute the amount of Unearned Passenger Revenue as of the close of business on the preceding business day (hereinafter referred to as the “Determination Date”) and deliver a Recomputation Certificate to Escrow Agent on such date. In each such weekly recomputation Customer shall calculate the amount by which Unearned Passenger Revenue has decreased due to (i) the cancellation of reservations and the corresponding refund of monies from Customer to the persons or entities canceling such reservations; (ii) the amount which Customer has earned as revenue as a result of any cancellation fee charged upon the cancellation of any reservations; (iii) the amount which Customer has earned due to the completion of cruises; and (iv) the amount by which Unearned Passenger Revenue has increased due to receipts from passengers for future water transportation and all other accommodations, services and facilities relating thereto and not yet performed.</P>
              <P>The amount of Unearned Passenger Revenue as recomputed shall be compared with the amount of Unearned Passenger Revenue for the immediately preceding period to determine whether there has been a net increase or decrease in Unearned Passenger Revenue. If the balance of the Escrow Account as of the Determination Date exceeds the sum of the amount of Unearned Passenger Revenue, as recomputed, plus the Fixed Amount then applicable, then Escrow Agent shall make any excess funds in the Escrow Account available to Customer. If the balance in the Escrow Account as of the Determination Date is less than the sum of the amount of Unearned Passenger Revenue, as recomputed, plus an amount equal to the Fixed Amount, Customer shall deposit an amount equal to such deficiency with the Escrow Agent. Such deposit shall be made in immediately available funds via wire transfer or by direct transfer from the Customer's U.S. Bank checking account before the close of business on the next business day following the day on which the Recomputation Certificate is received by Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall promptly notify the Commission within two business days any time a deposit required by a Recomputation Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent is not timely made.</P>

              <P>7. Customer shall furnish a Recomputation Certificate, in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex 1, to the Federal Maritime Commission (the “Commission”) and to the Escrow Agent setting forth the weekly recomputation of Unearned Passenger Revenue required by the terms of Paragraph 6 above. Customer shall mail or fax to the Commission and deliver to the Escrow Agent the required Recomputation Certificate before the close of business on the business day on which Customer recomputes the amount of Unearned Passenger Revenue. <PRTPAGE P="254"/>Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, Escrow Agent shall not make any funds available to Customer out of the Escrow Account because of a decrease in the amount of Unearned Passenger Revenue or otherwise, until such time as Escrow Agent receives the above described Recomputation Certificate from Customer, which Recomputation Certificate shall include the Customer's verification certification in the form attached hereto as Annex 1. The copies of each Recomputation Certificate to be furnished to the Commission shall be mailed to the Commission at the address provided in Paragraph 25 herein. If copies are not mailed to the Commission, faxed or emailed copies shall be treated with the same legal effect as if an original signature was furnished. No repayment of the Fixed Amount may be made except upon approval of the Commission.</P>
              <P>Within fifteen (15) days after the end of each calendar month, Escrow Agent shall provide to Customer and to the Commission at the addresses provided in Paragraph 25 below, a comprehensive statement of the Escrow Account. Such statement shall provide a list of assets in the Escrow Account, the balance thereof as of the beginning and end of the month together with the original cost and current market value thereof, and shall detail all transactions that took place with respect to the assets and investments in the Escrow Account during the preceding month.</P>
              <P>8. At the end of each quarter of Customer's fiscal year, Customer shall cause the independent auditors then acting for it to conduct an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards with respect to the weekly Recomputation Certificates furnished by Customer of the Unearned Passenger Revenues and the amounts to be deposited in the Escrow Account and to express their opinion within forty-five (45) days after the end of such quarter as to whether the calculations at the end of each fiscal quarter are in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 6 of this Agreement. The determination of Unearned Passenger Revenue of such independent auditors shall have control over any computation of Unearned Passenger Revenue by Customer in the event of any difference between such determinations. To the extent that the actual amount of the Escrow Account is less than the amount determined by such independent auditors to be required to be on deposit in the Escrow Account, Customer shall immediately deposit an amount of cash into the Escrow Account sufficient to cause the balance of the Escrow Account to equal the amount determined to be so required. Such deposit shall be completed no later than the business day after receipt by the Escrow Agent of the auditor's opinion containing the amount of such deficiency.</P>
              <P>The opinion of such independent auditors shall be furnished by such auditors directly to Customer, to the Commission and to the Escrow Agent at their addresses contained in this Agreement. In the event that a required deposit to the Escrow Agent is not made within one Business Day after receipt of an auditor's report or a Recomputation Certificate, Escrow Agent shall send notification to the Commission within the next two Business Days.</P>
              <P>9. Escrow Agent shall invest the funds in the Escrow Account in Qualified Investments as directed by Customer in its sole and absolute discretion. “Qualified Investments” means, to the extent permitted by applicable law:</P>
              <P>(a) Government obligations or obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America;</P>
              <P>(b) Commercial paper issued by a United States company rated in the two highest numerical “A” categories (without regard to further gradation or refinement of such rating category) by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation, or in the two highest numerical “Prime” categories (without regard to further gradation or refinement of such rating) by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.;</P>
              <P>(c) Certificates of deposit and money market accounts issued by any United States bank, savings institution or trust company, including the Escrow Agent, and time deposits of any bank, savings institution or trust company, including the Escrow Agent, which are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;</P>
              <P>(d) Corporate bonds or obligations which are rated by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. in one of their three highest rating categories (without regard to any gradation or refinement of such rating category by a numerical or other modifier); and</P>
              <P>(e) Money market funds registered under the Federal Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and whose shares are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and whose shares are rated “AAA”, “AA + ” or “AA” by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation.</P>
              <P>10. All interest and other profits earned on the amounts placed in the Escrow Account shall be credited to Escrow Account.</P>

              <P>11. This Agreement has been entered into by the parties hereto, and the Escrow Account has been established hereunder by Customer, to establish the financial responsibility of Customer as the owner, operator or charterer of the passenger vessel(s) (see Exhibit A), in accordance with Section 3 of Public Law 89-777, 89th Congress, approved November 6, 1966 (the “Act”). The Escrow Account shall be held by Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, to be utilized to discharge Customer's legal liability to indemnify the passengers of the named <PRTPAGE P="255"/>vessel(s) for non-performance of transportation within the meaning of Paragraph 3 of the Act. The Escrow Agent shall make indemnification payments pursuant to written instructions from Customer, on which the Escrow Agent may rely, or in the event that such legal liability has not been discharged by Customer within twenty-one (21) days after any such passenger has obtained a final judgment (after appeal, if any) against Customer from a United States Federal or State Court of competent jurisdiction the Escrow Agent is authorized to pay funds out of the Escrow Account, after such twenty-one day period, in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of an appropriate order of a court of competent jurisdiction on receipt of a certified copy of such order.</P>
              <P>As further security for Customer's obligation to provide water transportation to passengers holding tickets for transportation on the passenger vessel(s) (see Exhibit A) Customer will pledge to each passenger who has made full or partial payment for future passage on the named vessel(s) an interest in the Escrow Account equal to such payment. Escrow Agent is hereby notified of and acknowledges such pledges. Customers' instructions to Escrow Agent to release funds from the Escrow Account as described in this Agreement shall constitute a certification by Customer of the release of pledge with respect to such funds due to completed, canceled or terminated cruises. Furthermore, Escrow Agent agrees to hold funds in the Escrow Account until directed by Customer or a court order to release such funds as described in this Agreement.

              <P>Whereas, the Principal intends to become a holder of a Certificate (Casualty) pursuant to the provisions of subpart B of part 540 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, and has elected to file with the Federal Maritime Commission such a bond to insure financial responsibility to meet any liability it may incur for death or injury to passengers or other persons on voyages to or from U.S. ports, and</P>

              <P>Whereas, this bond is written to assure compliance by the Principal as an authorized holder of a Certificate (Casualty) pursuant to <PRTPAGE P="262"/>subpart B of part 540 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, and shall inure to the benefit of any and all passengers or other persons to whom the Principal may be held legally liable for any of the damages herein described.</P>
              <P>Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if the Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to passengers or other persons any sum or sums for which the Principal may be held legally liable by reason of the Principal's failure faithfully to meet any liability the Principal may incur for death or injury to passengers or other persons on voyages to or from U.S. ports, while this bond is in effect pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of subpart B of part 540 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise, to remain in full force and effect.</P>
              <P>The liability of the Surety with respect to any passenger or other persons shall in no event exceed the amount of the Principal's legal liability under any final judgment or settlement agreement, except that, if the aggregate amount of such judgments and settlements exceeds an amount computed in accordance with the formula contained in section 2(a) of Pub.

The Principal or the Surety may at any time terminate this bond by written notice sent by certified mail to the other and to the Federal Maritime Commission at its Office in Washington, D.C., such termination to become effective thirty (30) days after actual receipt of said notice by the Commission, except that no such termination shall become effective while a voyage is in progress. The Surety shall not be liable hereunder for any liability incurred for death or injury to passengers or other persons on voyages to or from U.S. ports after the termination of this bond as herein provided, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the Surety hereunder for such liability incurred for death or injury to passengers or other persons on voyages to or from U.S. ports prior to the date such termination becomes effective.</P>

              <P>1. Whereas ______ (Name of Applicant) (Hereinafter referred to as the “Applicant”) is the Owner or Charterer of the passenger Vessel(s) specified in the annexed Schedule (“the Vessels”), which are or may become engaged in voyages to or from U.S. ports, and the Applicant desires to establish its financial responsibility in accordance with section 2 of Public Law 89-777, 89th Congress, approved November 6, 1966 (“the Act”) then, provided that the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”) shall have accepted, as sufficient for that purpose, the Applicant's application, supported by this Guaranty, and provided that FMC shall issue to the Applicant a Certificate (Casualty) (“Certificate”), the undersigned Guarantor hereby guarantees to discharge the applicant's legal liability in respect of claims for damages for death or injury to passengers or other persons on voyages of the Vessels to or from U.S. ports, in the event that such legal liability has not been discharged by the Applicant within 21 days after any such passenger or other person, or, in the event of death, his or her personal representative, has obtained a final judgment (after appeal, if any) against the Applicant from a U.S. Federal or State Court <PRTPAGE P="263"/>of competent jurisdiction, or has become entitled to payment of a specified sum by virtue of a compromise settlement agreement made with the Applicant, with the approval of the Guarantor, whereby, upon payment of the agreed sum, the Applicant is to be fully, irrevocably and unconditionally discharged from all further liability to such passenger or other person, or to such personal representative, with respect to such claim.</P>
              <P>2. The Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty shall in no event exceed the amount of the Applicant's legal liability under any such judgment or settlement agreement, except that, if the aggregate amount of such judgments and settlements exceeds an amount computed in accordance with the formula contained in section 2(a) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 44103(b)), then the Guarantor's total liability under this Guaranty shall be limited to an amount computed in accordance with such formula.</P>
              <P>3. The Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty shall attach only in respect of events giving rise to causes of action against the Applicant in respect of any of the Vessels for damages for death or injury within the meaning of section 2 of the Act, occurring after the Certificate has been granted to the Applicant and before the expiration date of this Guaranty, which shall be the earlier of the following dates:</P>
              <P>(a) The date whereon the Certificate is withdrawn, or for any reason becomes invalid or ineffective; or</P>
              <P>(b) The date 30 days after the date of receipt by FMC of notice in writing (including telex or cable) that the Guarantor has elected to terminate this Guaranty, except that if, on the date which would otherwise have been the expiration date of this Guaranty under the foregoing provisions of this Clause 3, any of the Vessels is on a voyage in respect of which such Vessel would not have received clearance in accordance with section 2(e) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 44105) without the Certificate, then the expiration date of this Guaranty shall, in respect of such Vessel, be postponed to the date on which the last passenger on such voyage shall have fully disembarked.</P>
              <P>4. If, during the currency of this Guaranty, the Applicant requests that a vessel owned or operated by the Applicant, and not specified in the annexed Schedule, should become subject to this Guaranty, and if the Guarantor accedes to such request and so notifies FMC in writing (including telex or cable), then provided that, within 30 days of receipt of such notice FMC shall have granted a Certificate, such vessel shall thereupon be deemed to be one of the Vessels included in the said Schedule and subject to this Guaranty.</P>

              <P>5. The Guarantor hereby designates ______, with offices at ______, as the Guarantor's legal agent for Service of process for the purposes of the Rules of the Federal Maritime Commission, subpart B of part 540 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, issued under section 2 of the Pub.

            <P>(a) 8(c) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (“the Act”) (46 U.S.C. 40502) authorizes ocean common carriers and agreements between or among ocean common carriers to enter into a service contract with a shippers' association, subject to the requirements of the Act. Section 10(b)(10) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 41104(10)) prohibits carriers from unreasonably refusing to deal or negotiate. Section 7(a)(2) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 40307(a)(3)) exempts from the antitrust laws any activity within the scope of that Act, undertaken with a reasonable basis to conclude that it is pursuant to a filed and effective agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) The Federal Maritime Commission interprets these provisions to establish that a common carrier or conference may not require a shippers' association to obtain or apply for a Business Review Letter from the Department of Justice prior to or as part of a service contract negotiation process.</P>

            <P>Section 10(a)(1) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 41102(a)) states that it is unlawful for any person to obtain or attempt to obtain transportation for property at less than the properly applicable rates, by any “unjust or unfair device or means.” An essential element of the offense is use of an “unjust or unfair device or means.” In the absence of evidence of bad faith or deceit, the Federal Maritime Commission will not infer an “unjust or unfair device or means” from the failure of a shipper to pay ocean freight. An “unjust or unfair device or means” could be inferred where a shipper, in bad faith, induced the carrier to relinquish its possessory lien on the cargo and to transport the cargo without prepayment by the shipper of the applicable freight charges.</P>

It is the further purpose of the regulations of this part to afford notice of the general circumstances under which the authority granted to the Commission under section 19 may be invoked and the nature of the regulatory actions contemplated.</P>

            <P>(c) Upon initiation of an investigation, interested persons will be given the opportunity to participate in the proceeding pursuant to the procedures set forth in the notice.

            <P>(d) An investigation shall be completed and a decision rendered within 120 days after it has commenced as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the Commission determines that an additional 90-day period is necessary in order to obtain sufficient information on which to render a decision. When the Commission determines to extend the investigation period for an additional 90 days, it shall issue a notice clearly stating the reasons therefor.</P>

            <P>In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3518(c)(1)(B), and except for investigations undertaken with reference to a category of individuals or entities (e.g., an entire industry), any information request or requirement <PRTPAGE P="275"/>in this part is not subject to the requirements of section 3507(f) of the Paperwork Reduction Act because such collection of information is pursuant to a civil, administrative action or investigation by an agency of the United States against specific individuals or entities.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 560.1</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Purpose; general provisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) It is the purpose of this part to enumerate certain conditions resulting from the action of a common carrier, acting alone or in concert with any person, or a foreign government, which unduly impair the access of a vessel documented under the laws of the United States whether liner, bulk, tramp or other vessel, (hereinafter “U.S. flag vessel”) to ocean trade between foreign ports, which includes intermodal movements, and to establish procedures by which the owner or operator of a U.S. flag vessel (hereinafter “U.S. flag carrier”) may petition the Federal Maritime Commission for relief under the authority of section 13(b)(6)of the Shipping Act of 1984 (“the Act”) (46 U.S.C. 41108(d)).</P>
            <P>(2) It is the further purpose of this part to indicate the general circumstances under which the authority granted to the Commission under section 13(b)(6) (46 U.S.C. 41108(d)) may be invoked, and the nature of the subsequent actions contemplated by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(3) This part also furthers the goals of the Act with respect to encouraging the development of an economically sound and efficient U.S. flag liner fleet as stated in section 2 of the Act (46 U.S.C. 40101).</P>
            <P>(b)(1) This part implements the statutory notice and hearing requirement and ensures that due process is afforded to all affected parties. At the same time, it allows for flexibility in structuring proceedings so that the Commission may act expeditiously whenever harm to a U.S. flag carrier resulting from impaired access to cross trades has been demonstrated or is imminent.</P>

            <P>(2) The provisions of part 502 of this chapter (Rules of Practice and Procedure) shall not apply to this part except for those provisions governing <E T="03">ex parte</E> communications (§ 502.11 of this chapter) and service of documents and copies of documents (§§ 502.114(b) and 502.118 of this chapter), and except as the Commission may otherwise determine by order.</P>
            <P>(c) The condition of unduly impaired access will be found only where a U.S. flag carrier is commercially able to enter a trade in which its access is being unduly impaired, or is reasonably expected to be impaired, or where actual participation in a trade by a U.S. flag carrier is being restricted for reasons other than its commercial ability or competitiveness.</P>
            <P>(d) In examining conditions in a trade between foreign ports, and in considering appropriate action, the Commission will give due regard to U.S. maritime policy and U.S. Government shipping arrangements with other nations, as well as the degree of reciprocal access afforded in U.S. foreign trades to the carriers of the countries against whom Commission action is contemplated.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Factors indicating conditions unduly impairing access.</SUBJECT>
            <P>For the purpose of this part, factors which would indicate the existence of conditions created by foreign government action or action of a common carrier acting alone or in concert with any person, which unduly impair access of a U.S. flag vessel engaged in or seeking access to ocean trade between foreign ports, include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(a) Imposition upon U.S. flag vessels or upon shippers or consignees using such vessels, of fees, charges, requirements, or restrictions different from those imposed on national-flag or other vessels, or which preclude or tend to preclude U.S. flag vessels from competing in the trade on the same basis as any other vessel.</P>
            <P>(b) Reservation of a substantial portion of the total cargo in the trade to national-flag or other vessels which results in failure to provide reasonable competitive access to cargoes by U.S. flag vessels.</P>

            <P>(c) Use of predatory practices, possibly including but not limited to the use of a vessel or vessels in a particular <PRTPAGE P="276"/>trade for the purpose of excluding, preventing, or reducing competition by driving another ocean common carrier out of that trade, and closed conferences employing deferred rebates, which unduly impair access of a U.S. flag vessel to the trade.</P>
            <P>(d) Any government or commercial practice that results in, or may result in, unequal and unfair opportunity for U.S. flag vessel access to port or intermodal facilities or services related to the carriage of cargo inland to or from ports in the trade.</P>
            <P>(e) Any other practice which unduly impairs access of a U.S. flag vessel to trade between foreign ports.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The regulations of this part are intended to carry out the Commission's mandate under section 9 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40701-40706), as amended by the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, to monitor the practices of controlled carriers and ensure that they do not:</P>
            <P>(1) Maintain rates or charges in their tariffs and service contracts that are below a level that is just and reasonable; nor</P>
            <P>(2) Establish, maintain or enforce unjust or unreasonable classifications, rules or regulations in those tariffs or service contracts which result or are likely to result in the carriage or handling of cargo at rates or charges that are below a just and reasonable level.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> The regulations contained in this part set forth the special procedures whereby controlled carriers' tariffs and service contracts become effective and are reviewed by the Commission. These regulations in no way exempt controlled carriers from other Commission regulations or statutory authority to which they may otherwise be subject as ocean common carriers. These regulations apply to all controlled carriers operating in the foreign commerce of the United States unless excepted under section 9(f) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40706), as reflected by § 565.5.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Controlled carrier</E> means an ocean common carrier that is, or whose operating assets are, directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a government. Ownership or control by a government shall be deemed to exist with respect to any ocean common carrier if:</P>
            <P>(1) A majority portion of the interest in the carrier is owned or controlled in any manner by that government, by any agency thereof, or by any public or private person controlled by that government; or</P>
            <P>(2) That government has the right to appoint or disapprove the appointment of a majority of the directors, the chief operating officer or the chief executive officer of the carrier.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Effective date</E> has the same meaning it has in 46 CFR part 520.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Classification as controlled carrier.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Notification.</E> The Commission will periodically review the ocean common carriers operating in the foreign commerce of the United States and will notify any ocean common carrier of any change in its classification as a controlled carrier.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Rebuttal of classification.</E> (1) Any ocean common carrier contesting such <PRTPAGE P="280"/>a classification may, within 30 days after the date of the Commission's notice, submit a rebuttal statement.</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission shall review the rebuttal and notify the ocean common carrier of its final decision.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Notification to Commission of change in control.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Whenever the operation, control or ownership of an ocean common carrier is transferred resulting in a majority portion of the interest of that ocean common carrier being owned or controlled in any manner by a government, the ocean common carrier shall immediately send written notification of the details of the change to the Secretary of the Commission. If a carrier is newly commencing ocean common carrier operations in a United States trade, and if a majority portion of the carrier is owned or controlled by a government, or if a government may approve or disapprove the majority of directors or the chief executive or operating officer of the carrier, the carrier shall immediately send written notification to the Secretary of the details of such ownership or control.</P>

            <P>All controlled carriers shall be subject to provisions of this part and section 9 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40701-40706) except those which meet the following exceptions:</P>
            <P>(a) When the vessels of the controlling state are entitled by a treaty of the United States to receive national or most-favored-nation treatment; or</P>
            <P>(b) When the controlled carrier operates in a trade served exclusively by controlled carriers.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Level of rates and charges generally.</SUBJECT>

            <P>No controlled carrier may maintain or enforce rates or charges in its tariffs or service contracts that are below a level that is just and reasonable. No controlled carrier may establish or maintain unjust or unreasonable classifications, rules, or regulations in its tariffs or service contracts. An unjust or unreasonable classification, rule or regulation means one that results or is likely to result in the carriage or handling of cargo at rates or charges that are below a just and reasonable level. <E T="03">See</E> § 565.9(a)(2) (Rate standards).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> Except for service contracts, the rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations of controlled carriers may not, unless the Commission has granted special permission, become effective sooner than the 30th day after the date of publication.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Open rates</E>—(1) <E T="03">Generally.</E> Controlled carriers that are members of conference agreements publishing rates for commodities designated as open by the conference are subject to the 30-day controlled carrier notice requirement, except when special permission is granted by the Commission under § 565.8.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Conference publication of reduced open rates.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a conference may, on less than 30 days' notice, publish reduced rates on behalf of controlled carrier members for open-rated commodities:</P>
            <P>(i) At or above the minimum level set by the conference; or</P>
            <P>(ii) At or above the level set by a member of the conference that has not been determined by the Commission to be a controlled carrier subject to section 9 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40701-40706).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Independent action rates of controlled carriers.</E> Conferences may publish on behalf of their controlled carrier members lower independent action rates on less than 30 days' notice, subject to the requirements of their basic agreements and subject to such rates being published at or above the level set by a member of the conference that has not been determined by the Commission to be a controlled carrier subject to section 9 of the Shipping Act of 1984.</P>

            <P>Section 8(d) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40501(e)) authorizes the Commission, in its discretion and for good cause shown, to permit increases or decreases in rates, or the issuance of <PRTPAGE P="281"/>new or initial rates, on less than statutory notice under § 565.7. Section 9(c) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40703, 40704(a)) authorizes the Commission to permit a controlled carrier's rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations to become effective on less than 30 days' notice. The Commission may also in its discretion and for good cause shown, permit departures from the requirements of this part. The Commission will consider such requests for special permission by controlled carriers pursuant to its procedures set forth at 46 CFR part 520.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 565.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Commission review, suspension and prohibition of rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">Request for justification.</E> Within 20 days of a request (with respect to its existing or proposed rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations) from the Commission, each controlled carrier shall file a statement of justification that sufficiently details the controlled carrier's need and purpose for such rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations upon which the Commission may reasonably base its determination of the lawfulness thereof.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Rate standards.</E> (i) In determining whether rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations by a controlled carrier are just and reasonable, the Commission shall take into account whether the rates or charges which have been published or assessed or which would result from the pertinent rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations are below a level which is fully compensatory to the controlled carrier based upon that carrier's actual or constructive costs.</P>

            <P>(ii) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, <E T="03">constructive costs</E> means the costs of another carrier, other than a controlled carrier, operating similar vessels and equipment in the same or a similar trade.</P>
            <P>(iii) The Commission may also take into account other appropriate factors, including, but not limited to, whether:</P>
            <P>(A) The rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations are the same as or similar to those published or assessed by other carriers in the same trade;</P>
            <P>(B) The rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations are required to assure movement of particular cargo in the trade; or</P>
            <P>(C) The rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations are required to maintain acceptable continuity, level or quality of common carrier service to or from affected ports.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Time for determination.</E> The Commission shall determine within 120 days of the receipt of information requested by the Commission under this section, whether the rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations of a controlled carrier may be unjust and unreasonable. Whenever the Commission is of the opinion that the rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations published or assessed by a controlled carrier may be unjust and unreasonable, the Commission shall issue an order to the controlled carrier to show cause why those rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations should not be prohibited.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Suspension.</E> Pending a decision on whether to prohibit the rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations of a controlled carrier, the Commission may suspend the rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations. <E T="03">See</E> § 565.10.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Prohibition.</E> The Commission shall prohibit the use of any rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations that the controlled carrier has failed to demonstrate to be just and reasonable. In a proceeding under this paragraph, the burden of proof is on the controlled carrier to demonstrate that its rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations are just and reasonable. The use of rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations published or assessed by a controlled carrier that have been suspended or prohibited by the Commission is unlawful.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Publication.</E> All final orders of prohibition shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

            <SUBJECT>Suspension procedures, period of suspension, and replacement rates.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">Suspension prior to effective date.</E> Pending a determination as to their <PRTPAGE P="282"/>lawfulness in a prohibition proceeding as described in § 565.9, the Commission may suspend the rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations at any time before their effective date.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Suspension after effective date.</E> In the case of rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations that have already become effective, the Commission may, upon the issuance of an order to show cause, suspend those rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations on not less than 30 days' notice to the controlled carrier.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Period of suspension.</E> In any case, no period of suspension may be greater than 180 days.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Implementation.</E> (1) Upon issuance of an order suspending a rate, charge, classification, rule or regulation in whole or in part, the Commission shall direct the controlled carrier to remove the suspended material from its tariff publication; or</P>
            <P>(2) if the matter subject to the suspension order is not covered by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Commission shall set forth procedures in the order for implementing the suspension.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Publication.</E> All orders of suspension shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Replacement rates.</E> Controlled carriers may publish in tariffs or file in service contracts rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations in lieu of the suspended matter (“replacement rates”).</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> In the case of replacement rates which are published in tariffs and which are scheduled to become effective during a suspension period, may become effective immediately upon either their publication in tariffs or upon the effective date of the suspension, whichever is later.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Rejection of replacement rates.</E> The Commission may reject the replacement rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations published in tariffs or filed in service contracts to take effect during the suspension period if they are unjust and unreasonable. In determining whether to reject replacement rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations, the Commission will consider whether they would result in total charges (i.e, rate plus applicable surcharges) that are lower than the lowest comparable charges effective for a common carrier, other than a controlled carrier, serving the same trade.</P>
            <P>(3) At the same time it announces replacement rates, the controlled carrier shall submit to the Secretary of the Commission, a letter identifying the specific competing common carrier's rates, charges, classification or rules resulting in total charges which are equal to or lower than its own.</P>
