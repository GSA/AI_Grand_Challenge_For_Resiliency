      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2018), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemptions for vessels.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) For an individual vessel or category of vessels, upon the specific recommendation of the assigning authority, the Commandant may authorize an <PRTPAGE P="10"/>exemption from one or more load line requirements. Such recommendation and authorization will depend upon provision of any additional features as deemed necessary by the authorities to ensure the vessel's safety in the services and under the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Exemptions from specific load line requirements for vessels meeting requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are authorized, subject to certain conditions, including type of voyage engaged in, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For vessels engaged on international voyages between the United States and near neighboring ports of its possessions or of foreign countries. The exemptions may be permitted because the requirements are deemed to be unreasonable or impracticable due to the sheltered nature of the waters on which the voyages occur or other conditions. These exemptions shall be valid only so long as such a vessel shall remain engaged on specific designated voyages. If the voyage involves a foreign country or countries, the United States will require an exemption agreement with such country or countries prior to the issuance of the appropriate load line certificate.</P>
              <P>(2) For vessels engaged on international voyages which embody features of a novel kind, and where nonexemption may seriously impede research, development, and incorporation of novel features into vessels. If the voyage or voyages intended involve a foreign country or countries, then the United States will require an exemption agreement with such country or countries prior to the issuance of a Load Line Exemption Certificate. If the Commandant grants an exemption pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2) to a U.S. flag vessel that operates on the Great Lakes of North America, he may notify the Chairman of the Board of Steamship Inspection of Canada of the nature of the exemption, but no special exemption certificate is issued.</P>
              <P>(3) For a vessel not normally engaged on international voyages but which is required to undertake a single international voyage under exceptional circumstances.</P>
              <P>(4) For self-propelled hopper dredges engaged on international voyages or on limited service domestic voyages by sea. These vessels may be exempt from applicable hatch cover requirements of § 42.15-25 of this part by showing they meet the requirements in § 174.310 of this chapter. When a Load Line Exemption Certificate is issued for this exemption, it must have an endorsement that only seawater is allowed in the vessel's hoppers.</P>
              <P>(c) A vessel given one or more exemptions from load line requirements under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be issued the appropriate load line certificate, using Form A1, A2, or A3. In each case the exemptions shall be specified on the load line certificate together with the Convention authority which authorizes such exemptions.</P>
              <P>(d) A vessel given one or more exemptions under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section will be issued a Load Line Exemption Certificate, using Form E1. This certificate shall be in lieu of a regular load line certificate, and the vessel shall be considered as in compliance with applicable load line requirements.</P>
              <P>(e) The Commandant may exempt from any of the requirements of this part a vessel that engages on a domestic voyage by sea or a voyage solely on the Great Lakes and embodies features of a novel kind, if the novel features and any additional safety measures required are described on the face of the issued certificate.</P>
              <P>(f) A vessel that is not usually engaged on domestic voyages by sea or on voyages on the Great Lakes but that, in exceptional circumstances, is required to undertake a single such voyage between two specific ports is—</P>
              <P>(1) Subject to 46 U.S.C. 5101-5116 and the applicable regulations of this subchapter; and</P>
              <P>(2) Issued a single voyage load line authorization by the Commandant that states the conditions under which the voyage may be made and any additional safety measures required for a single voyage.</P>

              <SUBJECT>U.S.-flag vessels and Canadian vessels navigating on sheltered waters of Puget Sound and contiguous west coast waters of United States and Canada.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In a Treaty between the United States and Canada proclaimed on August 11, 1934, the respective Governments were satisfied of the sheltered nature of certain waters of the west coast of North America. It was agreed to exempt vessels of the United States and Canadian vessels from load line requirements when such vessels engage on international voyages originating on, wholly confined to, and terminating on such waters. In Article I of this Treaty these waters are described as follows: “* * * the waters of Puget Sound, the waters lying between Vancouver Island and the mainland, and east of a line from a point 1 nautical mile west of the city limits of Port Angeles in the State of Washington to Race Rocks on Vancouver Island, and of a line from Hope Island, British Columbia, to Cape Calvert, Calvert Island, British Columbia, the waters east of a line from Cape Calvert to Duke Point on Duke Island, and the waters north of Duke Island and east of Prince of Wales Island, Baranof Island, and Chicagof Island, the waters of Peril, Neva, and Olga Straits to Sitka, and the waters east of a line from Port Althorp of Chicagof Island to Cape Spencer, Alaska, are sheltered waters * * *.”</P>
              <P>(b) U.S.-flag vessels and Canadian vessels navigating on the treaty waters on a voyage as described in paragraph (a) of this section are by virtue of this Treaty of August 11, 1934, not subject to load line requirements in 46 U.S.C. 5101-5116, the 1966 Convention, and the regulations in this subchapter. Vessels navigating these sheltered waters and passing outside their boundary on any voyage cannot claim the benefits of this Treaty and shall be in compliance with the applicable load line requirements in 46 U.S.C. 5101-5116, the 1966 Convention, and the regulations in this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(c) Since subdivision requirements apply to all passenger vessels subject to the 1960 International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea, those passenger vessels navigating on the waters described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be in compliance with such 1960 Convention requirements and the regulations in part 46 of this subchapter. The Coast Guard issues to such a vessel a stability letter. The assigning authority is authorized to issue to such a passenger vessel an appropriate load line certificate, modified to meet the conditions governing her service assignment, and marking.</P>

              <SUBJECT>American Bureau of Shipping as an assigning authority.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The American Bureau of Shipping, with its home office at ABS Plaza, 16855 Northchase Drive, Houston, TX 77060, is hereby appointed as the prime assigning and issuing authority under the provisions of Articles 13 and 16(3) of the 1966 Convention and as directed by 46 U.S.C. 5107. In this capacity the American Bureau of Shipping is empowered to assign load lines, to perform surveys required for load line assignments, and to determine that the position of and the manner of marking vessels has been done in accordance with applicable requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) On behalf of the United States of America, the American Bureau of Shipping is authorized to issue or reissue, under its own seal and signature of its officials, the appropriate load line certificates or International Load Line Exemption Certificate as described in subpart 42.50 of this part or in parts 44 to 46, inclusive, of this subchapter. Except for the International Load Line Exemption Certificate, the required load line certificate issued to a specific vessel shall certify to the correctness of the load line marks assigned and marked on the vessel and compliance with authorized conditions, restrictions, and/or exemptions, if any. The International Load Line Exemption Certificate when issued to a vessel shall certify as to the compliance with the information applicable to the vessel.</P>

              <P>(c) The designation and delegation to the American Bureau of Shipping as an assigning and issuing authority shall be in effect indefinitely unless for due cause it shall be terminated by proper authority and notice of cancellation is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(d) The American Bureau of Shipping is authorized to revalidate from time to time by endorsement a load line certificate or an International Load Line Exemption Certificate.</P>
              <P>(e) Before revalidating any certificate by endorsement, the American Bureau of Shipping shall verify that the required load line marks assigned are marked on the vessel and the vessel is in compliance with authorized conditions, restrictions, and/or exemptions, if any.</P>
              <P>(f) The American Bureau of Shipping shall issue all load line certificates in duplicate; one copy shall be delivered to the owner or master of the vessel, and one copy (together with a summary of data used to determine the assigned load lines) shall be forwarded to the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(g) The American Bureau of Shipping shall prepare a load line survey report on each new vessel or existing vessel when brought into complete compliance with this part prior to issuing the required load line certificate described in subpart 42.50 of this part. At the time the certificate is delivered, one copy of this report shall be delivered to the master of the vessel, and one copy shall be forwarded to the Commandant. When a load line survey report is superseded or revised, one copy shall be delivered to the master of the vessel, and one copy shall be forwarded to the Commandant.</P>

              <P>(h) The load line survey report or stability information furnished to a specific vessel shall include a statement of <PRTPAGE P="17"/>the locations of all watertight subdivision bulkheads, including steps or recesses therein, which may be involved in the vessel's load line assignment.</P>

              <P>(a) Since vessels described in § 42.03-5 or § 42.03-10 when found qualified are issued appropriate load line certificates or load line exemption certificates, under U.S. responsibility as indicated in § 42.07-45 such certificates may be canceled by proper U.S. authority for due cause, including one or more of the causes listed in paragraph (b) of this section. Such action may occur prior to the expiration date on the certificate and normal certificate surrender. The cancellation of such certificate means that the correctness of load line marks and compliance with conditions of assignment for the named vessel no longer are recognized by the United States and that the existing assigned load line marks are voided.</P>
              <P>(b) Certain causes for automatic cancellation of certificates are:</P>
              <P>(1) The conditions of assignment have not been maintained as required by this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(2) Material alterations have taken place in the hull or superstructure of the vessel, which will necessitate the assignment of an increased freeboard.</P>
              <P>(3) The fittings and appliances have not been maintained in an effective condition for the protection of openings, guardrails, freeing ports, and means of access to crew's quarters.</P>
              <P>(4) The structural strength of the vessel is lowered to such an extent that the vessel is unsafe.</P>
              <P>(5) The load line certificate or International Load Line Exemption Certificate is not endorsed to show the vessel has been surveyed annually or periodically by the issuing authority as required by this part or the 1966 Convention.</P>
              <P>(6) Issuance of a new load line certificate for the same vessel.</P>
              <P>(7) Surrender of a certificate for cancellation when required.</P>
              <P>(8) The owner, master, or agent of the vessel has furnished false or fraudulent information in or with the application for a certificate.</P>

              <P>(a) The Director, Field Operations (DFO) or the Coast Guard District Commander may detain a vessel for survey if there is reason to believe that the vessel is proceeding on her journey in excess of the draft allowed by the regulations in this subchapter as indicated by the vessel's load line certificate, or otherwise. The Coast Guard District Commander may detain a vessel if it is so loaded as to be manifestly unsafe to proceed to sea.</P>
              <P>(b) If the Director, Field Operations (DFO) orders a vessel detained, he shall immediately inform the Coast Guard District Commander thereof, who shall thereupon advise the Director, Field Operations (DFO) whether or not he deems that the vessel may proceed to sea with safety. If the Coast Guard District Commander orders a vessel detained, such officer will furnish the Director, Field Operations (DFO) immediate notification of such detention. The clearance shall be refused to any vessel which shall have been ordered detained, which shall be in effect until it is shown that the vessel is not in violation of the applicable law and the regulations in this subchapter.</P>

              <P>(1) Where a vessel is detained for noncompliance with “material alteration” and “effective maintenance” requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the detention shall only be exercised insofar as may be necessary to <PRTPAGE P="20"/>ensure that the vessel can proceed to sea without danger to passengers or crew.</P>
              <P>(c) The detention of a vessel will be by written order of either the Coast Guard District Commander or the Director, Field Operations (DFO), depending on who orders the detention. The Coast Guard District Commander will immediately arrange for a survey in the manner prescribed by 46 U.S.C. 5113. Unless the owner or agent waives in writing and stipulates to accept the Coast Guard's survey, the Coast Guard District Commander shall appoint three disinterested surveyors and, where practicable, one of them shall be from the Surveying Staff of the American Bureau of Shipping. Such surveyors shall conduct a survey to ascertain whether or not the vessel is loaded in violation of the applicable provisions in the load line acts, and the regulations in this subchapter. If the survey confirms the allegation that the vessel is in violation of either law or the applicable regulations in this subchapter, “the owner and agent shall bear the costs of the survey in addition to any penalty or fine imposed”, as provided in these laws.</P>
              <P>(d) Whenever a vessel is detained, the master or owner may, within 5 days, appeal to the Commandant who may, if he desires, order a further survey, and may affirm, set aside, or modify the order of the detaining officer.</P>
              <P>(e) Where a foreign vessel is detained or intervention action of any other kind is taken against a foreign vessel, the officer carrying out the action shall immediately inform in writing the Consul or the diplomatic representative of the State whose flag the vessel is flying, of the decision involved together with all pertinent circumstances under which intervention was deemed necessary.</P>
              <P>(f) Under 46 U.S.C. 5109 a vessel of a foreign country which has ratified the 1966 Convention, or which holds a recognized and valid 1930 Convention certificate, or which holds a valid Great Lakes Certificate, shall be exempt from the provisions of the regulations in this subchapter insofar as the marking of the load lines and the certificating thereof are concerned, so long as such country similarly recognizes the load lines established by this subchapter for the purpose of a voyage by sea subject to the proviso in paragraph (f)(1) of this section or the alternative proviso in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) If the foreign vessel is marked with load lines and has on board a valid International or Great Lakes Load Line Certificate certifying to the correctness of the marks, the control provisions in this part which are in accord with Article 21 of the 1966 Convention shall be observed. In this connection, the vessel shall not be loaded beyond the limits allowed by the certificate. The position of the load lines on the vessel shall correspond with the certificate. The vessel shall not have been so materially altered as to make the vessel manifestly unfit to proceed to sea without danger to human life, in regard to:</P>
              <P>(i) The hull or superstructure (if necessitating assignment of an increased freeboard); and/or,</P>
              <P>(ii) The appliances and fittings for protection of openings, guardrails, freeing ports, and means of access to crew's quarters (if necessitating replacement or other effective maintenance).</P>
              <P>(2) (Alternatively provided) If the foreign vessel has on board an International Load Line Exemption Certificate in lieu of an International Load Line Certificate, 1966, in such case, verify that it is valid and any conditions stipulated therein are met.</P>

              <P>(g) A foreign vessel of a nation for which the 1966 Convention has not come into force does not qualify for an International Load Line Certificate, 1966.

              <SUBJECT>Assignment of load lines.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The assignment of load lines is conditioned upon the structural efficiency and satisfactory stability of the vessel, and upon the provisions provided on the vessel for her effective protection and that of the crew. Certain vessels, such as vessels carrying all their cargo as deck cargo, or vessels where design or service require special conditions to be applicable, shall have certain stability limitations imposed on them, as may be necessary. When stability limitations for a vessel are prescribed, the assigning authority shall furnish the master the vessel's maximum draft permitted and other conditions, including reference to Commandant approved operating stability features, which may be applicable.</P>
              <P>(1) No load line assignment shall be made under this part to a vessel proceeding on a foreign voyage, or where the load line assignment is related to the flooded stability provisions and the vessel is proceeding on a domestic voyage, until the applicable light ship characteristics are established and incorporated into the vessel's stability data approved by the Commandant and furnished to the master of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(2) If load line assignments are made to vessels for coastwise voyages before the results of the required stability characteristics are determined and incorporated into the vessel's stability data approved by the Commandant, then such load line assignments shall be regarded as conditional and shall be subject to verification or modification for removal of the conditional status. Any vessel with a conditional load line assignment shall not be loaded beyond a conservative safe draft.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Before issuing a certificate or placement of load line marks on a vessel, the assigning and issuing authority shall make an initial or periodic survey of the vessel as required by this subchapter. A load line survey report shall be made, reflecting information and facts based on initial surveys, including required and special elements as may be deemed necessary by the assigning authority or the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial survey.</E> An initial survey shall be made before the vessel is put in service or the first time the assigning authority is requested to survey a vessel. The survey shall include a complete examination of its structure and equipment insofar as required by the applicable requirements in this subchapter. This survey shall be such as to ensure that the arrangements, materials, scantlings, and subsequent placement of load line marks fully comply with applicable requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Periodical survey.</E> A periodical survey shall be made at intervals not exceeding five (5) years from an initial or previous periodic survey. The survey shall be similar to the initial survey insofar as extent and purpose are concerned.</P>
              <P>(1) If the load line marks are found to be correct for the condition the vessel is then in, the assigning and issuing authority shall issue a new load line certificate, valid for such time as the condition of the vessel then warrants but in no case for a period of longer than 5 years. If, after a survey has been passed, a loadline certificate can not be issued before the current certificate expires, the current certificate may be extended by an endorsement in accordance with the requirements contained in § 42.07-45(d). This endorsement of the assigning authority shall be placed on the back of the certificate, as shown on the forms in subpart 42.50. However, if there have been alterations which affect the vessel's freeboards, such extension shall not be granted. This prohibition is the same as in Article 19(2) of the 1966 Convention.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Molded depth.</E> (1) The molded depth is the vertical distance measured from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side. In wood and composite vessels the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet. Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick <PRTPAGE P="28"/>garboards are fitted, the distance is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.</P>

              <P>(i) <E T="03">Freeboard deck.</E> (1) The freeboard deck is normally the uppermost complete deck exposed to weather and sea, which has permanent means of closing all openings in the weather part thereof, and below which all openings in the sides of the vessel are fitted with permanent means of watertight closing. In a vessel having a discontinuance freeboard deck, the lowest line of the exposed deck and the continuation of that line parallel to the upper part of the deck is taken as the freeboard deck. At the option of the owner and subject to the approval of the assigning authority a lower deck may be designated as the freeboard deck, provided it is a complete and permanent deck continuous in a fore and aft direction at least between the machinery space and peak bulkheads and continuous athwartships. When this lower deck is stepped the lowest line of the deck and the continuation of that line parallel to the upper part of the deck is taken as the freeboard deck.</P>
              <P>(2) When a lower deck is designated as the freeboard deck, that part of the hull which extends above the freeboard deck is treated as a superstructure so far as concerns the application of the conditions of assignment and the calculation of freeboard. It is from this deck that the freeboard is calculated.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Superstructure.</E> (1) A superstructure is a decked structure on the freeboard deck, extending from side to side of the vessel or with the side plating not being inboard of the shell plating more than 4 percent to the breadth. (<E T="03">B</E>). A raised quarter deck is regarded as a superstructure.</P>

              <P>(i) Enclosing bulkheads of efficient construction;</P>
              <P>(ii) Access openings, if any in these bulkheads fitted with doors complying with the requirements of § 42.15-10; and,</P>

              <P>(iii) All other openings in sides or ends of the superstructure fitted with efficient weathertight means of closing.

              <P>(b) The transverse extent of damage is assumed to be equal to B/5 or 11.5 meters (37.7 feet), whichever is less. The transverse extent is measured inboard from the side of the ship perpendicularly to the center line at the level of the summer load waterline.</P>
              <P>(c) If damage of a lesser extent than that specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section results in a more severe condition, the lesser extent must be assumed.</P>
              <P>(d) The following assumptions apply to the transverse damage specified in paragraph (b) of this section for a stepped or recessed bulkhead:</P>
              <P>(1) A transverse watertight bulkhead that has a step or recess located within the transverse extent of assumed damage may be considered intact if the step or recess is not more than 3.05 meters (10 feet) in length.</P>

              <P>(3) If within the transverse extent of damage, a transverse bulkhead has a step or recess more than 3.05 meters (10 feet) in length that coincides with the double bottom tank top or the inner boundary of a wing tank, respectively, all adjacent compartments within the transverse extent of assumed damage must be considered to be flooded simultaneously.</P>
              <P>(e) If a wing tank has openings into adjacent compartments, the wing tank and adjacent compartments must be considered as one compartment. This provision applies even where these openings are fitted with closing appliances except:</P>

              <P>As used in this part:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Length</E> (<E T="03">L</E>) means 96 percent of the total length on a waterline at 85 percent of the least moulded depth measured from the top of the keel or the length from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, if that is greater. In ships designed with a rake of keel the waterline on which this length is measured must be parallel to the designed waterline.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Perpendiculars</E> means the forward and after perpendiculars at the forward and after ends of the length (L). The forward perpendicular coincides with the foreside of the stem on the waterline on which the length is measured.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Amidships</E> means the middle of the length (L).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Breadth</E> unless expressly provided otherwise, means the maximum breadth of the ship, measured amidships to the moulded line of the frame in a ship with a metal shell and to the outer surface of the hull in a ship with a shell of any other material.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Moulded Depth</E> means the vertical distance measured amidships from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side except that—</P>
              <P>(1) In vessels of other than metal construction, the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet;</P>
              <P>(2) Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the distance is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel;</P>
              <P>(3) In ships having rounded gunwales, this distance is measured to the point of intersection of the moulded lines of the deck and side, the lines extending as though the gunwale were of angular design; and</P>
              <P>(4) Where the freeboard deck is stepped and the raised part of the deck extends over the point at which the moulded depth is to be determined, the distance is measured to a line of reference extending from the lower part of the deck along a line parallel with the raised part.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Depth for Freeboard</E> (<E T="03">D</E>) means—</P>
              <P>(1) Moulded depth amidships plus the thickness of the stringer plate with no allowance for sheathing; and</P>
              <P>(2) In a vessel having a rounded gunwale with a radius greater than 4 percent of the breadth (B) or having topsides of unusual form, the depth for freeboard (D) of a vessel having a midship section with vertical topsides and with the same round of beam and area of topside section equal to that provided by the actual midship section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Freeboard</E> means the distance measured vertically downwards amidships from the upper edge of the deck line to the upper edge of the related load line.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Freeboard Deck</E> means, normally, the uppermost complete deck exposed to weather and sea that has permanent means of closing all openings in the weather part thereof and below which all openings in the sides of the ship are fitted with permanent means of watertight closings except that—</P>

              <P>(1) In a ship having a discontinuous freeboard deck, the lowest line of the exposed deck and the continuation of that line parallel to the upper part of the deck is the freeboard deck.<PRTPAGE P="74"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) At the option of the owner and subject to the approval of the Commandant a lower deck may be designated as the freeboard deck, if it is a complete and permanent deck continuous in a fore and aft direction at least between the machinery space and peak bulkheads and continuous athwartships;</P>
              <P>(3) When this lower deck is stepped the lowest line of the deck and the continuation of that line parallel to the upper part of the deck is taken as the freeboard deck.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Superstructure</E> means a deck structure on the freeboard deck, extending from side to side of the ship or with the side plating not being inboard of the shell plating more than 4 percent of the breadth (B). A raised quarterdeck is a superstructure.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Enclosed superstructure</E> means a superstructure with enclosing bulkheads.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Height</E> of a superstructure means the least vertical height measured at side from the top of the superstructure deck beams to the top of the freeboard deck beams.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Length of a superstructure</E> (<E T="03">S</E>) means the mean length of the part of the superstructure which extends to the sides of the vessel and lies within the length (L).</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Flush deck ship</E> means a ship that has no superstructure on the freeboard deck.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Weathertight</E> means that in any sea conditions water will not penetrate into the ship.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Watertight</E> means designed to withstand a static head of water.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Exposed positions</E> means exposed to weather and sea.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Intact bulkhead</E> with respect to superstructure means a bulkhead with no openings.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">Steel</E> means steel and materials with which structures can be made equivalent to steel with respect to such parameters as yield strength, total deflection, flexural life, or resistance to galvanic or stress corrosion.</P>

              <P>(a) The required vessel, equipment, or installation plans, as listed in this subchapter, are general in character, but include all plans which normally show the intended construction and safety features coming under the cognizance of the Coast Guard. In a particular case, however, not all of the plans enumerated may be applicable, and in such cases the Coast Guard will so notify the submitter.</P>
              <P>(b) Manufacturers of pressure vessels and other components, which require specific fabrication inspection in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter, shall submit and obtain approval of the applicable construction plans prior to the commencement of such fabrication. Manufacturers of automatically controlled boilers shall submit and obtain approval of the applicable control system plans prior to installation of the boiler. Manufacturers of boilers which must meet the requirements of part 52 of this subchapter shall submit the applicable construction plans for review prior to installation.</P>

              <P>(a) As the relative locations of shipyards, design offices, and Coast Guard offices vary throughout the country, no specific routing will be required in the submittal of plans. In general, one of the procedures outlined in this section apply, but if a more expeditious procedure can be used, there will normally be no objection to it.</P>
              <P>(b) The plans may be submitted in duplicate to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, at or nearest the place where the vessel is to be built. Alternatively, the plans may be submitted in triplicate to the Marine Safety Center.</P>
              <P>(c) In the case of classed vessels, upon specific request by the submitter, the American Bureau of Shipping will arrange to forward the necessary plans to the Coast Guard indicating its action thereon. In this case, the plans will be returned directly to the submitter as noted in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) This part contains requirements for pressure vessels. table 54.01-5(a) gives a breakdown by parts in this subchapter of the regulations governing various types of pressure vessels, boilers, and thermal units.</P>
              <P>(b) Pressure vessels are divided into Classes I, I-L (low temperature), II, II-L (low temperature), and III. table 54.01-5(b) describes these classes and sets out additional requirements for welded pressure vessels.</P>
              <P>(c) The requirements for pressure vessels by class are as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) Class I-L and II-L pressure vessels must meet the applicable requirements in this part.<PRTPAGE P="135"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Pressure vessels containing hazardous materials as defined in § 150.115 of this chapter must meet the requirements of this part or, as applicable, the requirements in 49 CFR parts 171-177 or part 64 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, Classes I, II, and III pressure vessels not containing hazardous materials must be designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements in Section VIII, division 1, of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1) and must be stamped with the ASME “U” symbol. These pressure vessels must also comply with the requirements that are listed or prescribed in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section. Compliance with other provisions in this part is not required.</P>
              <P>(4) Classes II and III pressure vessels that have a net internal volume of less than 0.14 cubic meters (5 cubic feet) and do not contain hazardous materials must be stamped with either the ASME “U” or “UM” symbol. Compliance with other provisions in this part is not required.</P>
              <P>(d) Pressure vessels described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section must—</P>
              <P>(1) Have detailed plans that include the information required by § 54.01-18 (approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 2130-0181);</P>
              <P>(2) Meet § 54.01-35, § 54.20-3(c), and § 54.25-3 of this part;</P>
              <P>(3) Have pressure relief devices required by subpart 54.15;</P>
              <P>(4) Meet the applicable requirements in §§ 54.10-3, 54.10-20, and 54.10-25 for inspection, reports, and stamping;</P>
              <P>(5) If welded, meet the post weld heat treatment and minimum joint and radiography requirement in table 54.01-5(b); and</P>
              <P>(6) If a steam generating pressure vessel, meet § 54.01-10.</P>
              <P>(e) The plans required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be certified by a registered professional engineer to meet the design requirements in paragraph (d) of this section and in section VIII, division 1, of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The certification must appear on all drawings and analyses. The plans must be made available to the Coast Guard prior to the inspection required by § 54.10-3(c).</P>
              <P>(f) If a pressure vessel has more than one independent chamber and the chambers have different classifications, each chamber must, as a minimum, meet the requirements for its classification. If a single classification for the entire pressure vessel is preferred, the classification selected must be one that is required to meet all of the regulations applicable to the classification that is not selected. For example, if one chamber is Class I and one chamber is Class II-L, the only single classification that can be selected is Class I-L.</P>
              <P>(g) The design pressure for each interface between two chambers in a multichambered pressure vessel must be—</P>
              <P>(1) The maximum allowable working pressure (gauge) in the chamber with the higher pressure; or</P>
              <P>(2) If one chamber is a vacuum chamber, the maximum allowable working pressure (absolute) in the other chamber minus the least operating pressure (absolute) in the vacuum chamber.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Charpy V-notch impact tests.</E> Where required, Charpy V-notch tests shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM Specification E 23 (incorporated by reference, see § 54.01-1), “Notched Bar Impact Testing of Metallic Materials”, using the Type A specimen shown in Figure 4 of the specification. Special attention is drawn to the fact that the Charpy Keyhole and U-notch specimens are not acceptable substitutes for the Charpy V-notch specimen and shall not be used to qualify materials within the scope of this subpart. Each set of Charpy impact tests shall consist of three specimens. For materials <FR>1/2</FR>-inch thick or less, the largest possible Charpy specimens for that thickness shall be cut centered at the material's mid-thickness. For materials thicker than <FR>1/2</FR>-inch, full size Charpy specimens shall be cut centered at a location as near as practicable to a point midway between the material's surface and half-thickness. Except where otherwise specified, transversely oriented specimens must be used. When longitudinal specimens are used, the required energy values may not be less than 1.5 times the values required for transversely oriented specimens. In all cases the notch shall be cut normal to the material's surface. Test specimens shall be taken at least one “t” from any heat treated edge (where “t” is the material's nominal thickness).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Drop weight tests.</E> Where required, drop weight tests shall be conducted for no-break performance in accordance with ASTM Specification E 208 (incorporated by reference, see § 54.01-1), “Conducting Drop-Weight Test to Determine Nil-Ductility Transition <PRTPAGE P="141"/>Temperature of Ferritic Steels”. For material thicknesses between <FR>1/2</FR>-inch and <FR>5/8</FR>-inch, the ASTM E-208 specimen P-3, machined to <FR>1/2</FR>-inch thickness, shall be used with a stop distance of 0.090-inch. In preparing weld specimens for dropweight testing, weld reinforcement shall be ground flush, the hard facing bead centered on and transverse to the weld, and the notch centered on and parallel to the weld axis.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Retest procedures.</E> (1) When Charpy V-notch impact specimens are used and the average value of the three initial specimens fails to meet the stated requirements by an amount not exceeding 15 percent, or the value for more than one specimen is below the required average value of when the value for one specimen is below the minimum value permitted for a single specimen by an amount not exceeding 15 percent, three additional specimens from the same material may be tested and the results combined with those previously obtained to form a new average. This new average of six specimens must exceed the specified minimum average. In the event the Charpy retests fail, the material may still be qualified by exhibiting a no-break performance when tested in accordance with the drop weight procedure, if applicable. Two drop weight specimens shall be tested for each Charpy V-notch set of three initial specimens which failed to qualify. Failure of either or both of these drop weight specimens will constitute rejection of the material or weldments represented, except as outlined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) When drop weight specimens are used, retests shall be permitted only within the limits prescribed in ASTM Specification E 208 (incorporated by reference, see § 54.01-1), except as outlined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If, for heat treated base material, the required toughness results are not obtained in the initial test or in the retest, the material may be reheat treated one time and tested again in accordance with the initial requirements for the material.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternate toughness tests.</E> The Charpy V-notch impact values of §§ 54.05-20(a) and 54.05-25(a) are representative of those which correlate with the nil-ductility transition temperature determined by the drop-weight tests for the steels specified in § 54.25-10. For materials for which there are other data showing suitable correlation between Charpy V-notch and drop-weight tests, V-notch acceptance limits different from those tabulated herein may be specially approved by the Commandant, based upon the actual correlation. In the case of steels for which the tabulated Charpy V-notch values can be shown to be inapplicable or in the case of specially considered steels, or as an alternative to complying with the tabulated impact requirements, acceptance may be based upon the material exhibiting a no-break performance when tested in accordance with the drop-weight procedure. Whenever the drop-weight test is used as an alternative to the Charpy V-notch test, two drop-weight specimens shall be tested for each set of three Charpy V-notch specimens otherwise required. If the drop-weight test cannot be performed because of material thickness limitations (less than one-half inch) or product shape, or is otherwise inapplicable (because of heat treatment, chemistry, etc.), other tests and/or test criteria will be specified by the Commandant to assure the adequacy of the material for the intended application.</P>

              <P>(2) One or more test blocks shall be cut from billets or blooms selected at random from each heat of material. Each test block shall be forge-reduced in thickness to the thickness of the finished forgings to be certified, within the limitations set below. After forging to the reduced thickness, the test block shall be heat-treated in the same manner as the finished forgings represented, which heat-treatment of test blocks may be carried out in the furnace with the forgings, or separately. If carried out separately, both heat-treatments shall be done in automatically controlled furnaces equipped with calibrated recording pyrometers, the certified records of which shall be made available to the inspector.</P>
              <P>(3) One set of Charpy impact specimens or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable, shall be cut from each such test block and these specimens shall represent all forgings (up to 5 short tons) that are from the same heat of material and given the same heat-treatment as the test block, and the thickness of which does not differ from that of the test block by more than plus or minus 50 percent of 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches, whichever is less, except that forged flanges and tube sheets thicker than 5<FR>1/2</FR> inches may be qualified from a 4-inch test block.</P>

The impact specimens shall be cut from the heaviest section, clear of fillets, of the shape being tested with the axis of the specimens parallel to the axis of the bar or shape.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Castings.</E> (1) The manufacturer of castings may certify them by reporting the results of one set of Charpy impact specimens or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable, taken from each 5 short tons of product from each melting furnace heat. These specimens shall be taken either directly from a production casting or from test coupons cast attached thereto provided the additional requirements in this paragraph are met.</P>
              <P>(2) One set of Charpy impact or two drop-weight specimens may represent all castings (up to 5 short tons) that are from the same heat of material and that have a thickness that does not differ from the thickness of the section from which the specimens were taken by more than plus or minus 25 percent, or 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches, whichever is less. A wider range of thicknesses from one heat may be covered by taking additional sets of specimens from thicker or thinner material as may be required.</P>
              <P>(3) The test specimens shall be heat-treated in the same manner as the castings represented, which heat-treatment of specimens may be carried out in the furnace with the castings represented, or separately, but if carried out separately both heat-treatments shall be done in automatically controlled furnaces equipped with calibrated recording pyrometers, the certified records of which shall be made available to the marine inspector.</P>

When the part is too small to provide the specimens of at least minimum size, no impact test need be made. For such parts too small to impact test, toughness qualifications shall be determined by the Commandant based on material, chemical, and mechanical properties.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Production toughness testing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For vessels of welded construction, production toughness test plates shall be prepared for each 50 feet of longitudinal and circumferential butt weld in each Class I-L vessel, or for each 150 feet in each Class II-L vessel, except for material other than stainless steel that is exempted from impact test requirements by this subchapter. In the case of stainless steels, weld production toughness tests may be limited to weld metal only if this is all that is required be § 54.25-15. The test-plate thickness shall be the same as that of the vessel wall at the location of the production weld being sampled. The test plates shall be prepared, wherever possible, as run-off tabs attached at the ends of weld butts or seams. The rolling direction of the run-off tabs should be oriented parallel to the rolling direction of the adjacent production material. The test-plate material shall be taken from one of the heats of material used in the vessel, and both the electrodes and welding procedures shall be the same as used in the fabrication of the vessel. From each test plate, one set of three Charpy impact bars or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable according to the test used in procedure qualification, shall be taken transverse to the weld axis. For Charpy V-notch specimens, the notch shall be normal to the material surface and its location alternated (approximately) on successive tests between the weld metal and heat affected zone. Thus, approximately half of all weld production impact tests will be of weld metal and half of heat affected zone material. For the weld metal tests, the V-notch is to be centered between the fusion lines. For the heat affected zone tests, the notch is to be centered so as to sample, as nearly as practicable, the most critical location for toughness observed in the weld procedure qualification tests. Where the drop weight specimen is used in production weld testing, it shall be prepared in the same manner as specified for procedure qualification testing, § 54.05-15(b).</P>
              <P>(b) For vessels not exceeding 5 cubic feet in volume, one set of impact specimens, or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable according to the test used in procedure qualification, may represent all vessels from the same heat of material not in excess of 100 vessels, or one heat-treatment furnace batch. In addition, when such vessels are welded, one weld test plate made from one of the heats of material used, and two sets of impact specimens or two drop-weight specimens, as applicable, cut therefrom, may represent the weld metal in the smallest of: One lot of 100 vessels or less; or each heat-treatment furnace batch; or each 50 feet of welding for Class I-L vessels; or each 150 feet of welding for Class II-L vessels.</P>
              <P>(c) For several vessels or parts of vessels being welded in succession, the plate thickness of which does not vary by more than one-fourth inch, and which are made of the same grade of material, a test plate shall be furnished for each 50 feet of welding for Class I-L vessels or 150 feet of welding for Class II-L vessels. For each 50- or 150-foot increment of weld, as applicable, the test plates shall be prepared at the time of fabrication of the first vessel involving that increment.</P>
              <P>(d) The test plates and any other test material from which toughness test specimens are cut shall be given the same heat-treatment as the production material they represent. Test specimens representing other material than the weld toughness test plates shall preferably be cut from a part of the vessel material but may be cut from like material that has been heat-treated within the temperature range specified by the producer in treating the actual vessel material.</P>

              <P>(e) For nonpressure vessel type tanks and associated secondary barriers, as defined in § 38.05-4, subchapter D (Tank Vessels) of this chapter, production toughness test plates shall be prepared in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section. One set of toughness <PRTPAGE P="146"/>test plates shall be prepared for each 165 feet (50 meters) of production butt type welds.</P>

              <P>(b) Transversely oriented Charpy V-notch impact specimens of ASTM A 203 (incorporated by reference, see § 54.01-1) nickel steels must exhibit energies not less than the values shown in § 54.05-20 (a). Requirements for 9 percent nickel steels are contained in § 54.25-20. Other nickel alloy steels, when specially approved by the Commandant, must exhibit a no-break performance when tested in accordance with the drop weight procedure. If, for such materials, there are data indicating suitable correlation with drop-weight tests, Charpy V-notch tests may be specially considered by the Commandant in lieu of drop-weight tests. If the drop-weight test cannot be performed because of material thickness limitations (less than one-half inch), or product shape, or is otherwise inapplicable (because of heat treatment, chemistry etc.) other tests or test criteria will be specified by the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(c) Where sufficient data are available to warrant such waiver, the Commandant may waive the requirements for toughness testing austenitic stainless steel materials. Where required, austenitic stainless steels are to be tested using the drop-weight procedure and must exhibit a no-break performance. Where data are available indicating suitable correlation of Charpy V-notch results with drop-weight NDT or no-break performance, Charpy V-notch tests may be specially considered by the Commandant in lieu of dropweight tests.

The values for “S” shall be taken from tables UCS 23, UNF 23, UHA 23, or UHT 23 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 54.01-1). The value of “S” at test temperature shall be that taken for the material of the tabulated value of temperature closest to the test temperature.

External loadings which will exist in supporting structure during the hydrostatic test should be considered. The design shall consider the combined stress during hydrostatic testing due to pressure and the support reactions. This stress shall not exceed 90 percent of the yield stress of the material at the test temperature. In addition the adequacy of the supporting structure during hydrostatic testing should be considered in the design.</P>

              <P>(a) All safety and relief valves for use on pressure vessels or piping systems shall be designed to meet the protection and service requirements for which they are intended and shall be set to relieve at a pressure which does not exceed the “maximum allowable working pressure” of the pressure vessel or piping system. Relief valves are not required to have huddling chambers for other than steam service. In addition, safety valves used on vessels in which steam is generated shall meet § 52.01-120 of this subchapter except § 52.01-120(a)(9). For steam service below 206 kPa (30 psig), bodies of safety valves may be made of cast iron. Safety relief valves used in liquefied compressed gas service shall meet subpart 162.017 or 162.018 in subchapter Q (Specifications) of this chapter as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) Pilot-valve control or other indirect operation of safety valves is not permitted unless the design is such that the main unloading valve will open automatically at not over the set pressure and will discharge its full rated capacity if some essential part of the pilot or auxiliary device should fail. All other safety and relief valves shall be of the direct spring loaded type.</P>
              <P>(c) Safety and relief valves for steam or air service shall be provided with a substantial lifting device so that the disk can be lifted from its seat when the pressure in the vessel is 75 percent of that at which the valve is set to blow.</P>

              <P>(d) Safety and relief valves for service other than steam and air need not be provided with a lifting device although a lifting device is desirable if <PRTPAGE P="154"/>the vapors are such that their release will not create a hazard.</P>
              <P>(e) If the design of a safety or relief valve is such that liquid can collect on the discharge side of the disk, the valve shall be equipped with a drain at the lowest point where liquid can collect (for installation, see UG-134 of section VIII of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1).</P>
              <P>(f) Cast iron may be employed in the construction of relief valves for pressures not exceeding 125 pounds per square inch and temperatures not exceeding 450 °F. Seats or disks of cast iron are prohibited.</P>
              <P>(g) The spring in a relief valve in service for pressures up to and including 250 pounds per square inch shall not be reset for any pressure more than 10 percent above or 10 percent below that for which the relief valve is marked. For higher pressures, the spring shall not be reset for any pressure more than 5 percent above or 5 percent below that for which the relief valve is marked.</P>
              <P>(h) The rated relieving capacity of safety and relief valves for use on pressure vessels shall be based on actual flow test data and the capacity shall be certified by the manufacturer in accordance with one of the following:</P>

              <P>(b) For certain pressure vessels containing substances which may render a relief or safety valve inoperative, or where the installation of a valve is considered impractical, the Commandant may authorize or require the use of a rupture disk in parallel with or in lieu of a spring loaded safety or relief valve. These rupture disks shall:</P>

              <P>(2) Have a capacity for discharge such that the volume of release is sufficient to prevent the internal pressure from exceeding 120 percent of the “maximum allowable working pressure” with the pressure vessel exposed to fire conditions (see § 54.15-25); and,</P>
              <P>(3) Operate at a pressure level which does not produce fatigue failure of the disk. The normal maximum operating pressure multiplied by 1.3 shall not exceed the nominal disk burst pressure. (Notice that this restriction for protection of the rupture disk will usually require operation below the “maximum allowable working pressure” of the pressure vessel and therefore should be considered in design.)</P>
              <P>(c) All disks shall be oriented so that if rupture occurs, the disk fragments and pressure vessel discharge will be directed away from operating personnel and vital machinery.</P>

              <P>(c-1) For an independent tank that has a portion of the tank protruding above the open deck, the fire exposure factor must be calculated for the surface area above the deck and the surface area below the deck, and this calculation must be specially approved by the U.S. Coast Guard, Office of Design and Engineering Standards (CG-ENG)..</P>

              <P>(d) In determining the total safety valve relieving capacity, the arrangement and location of the valves on the tank will be evaluated. The valves shall be placed so that a number of valves sufficient to provide the required relieving capacity shall always be in communication with the cargo vapor phase. The possible motions which the tank may see in its intended service and attendant changes in cargo liquid level will be considered. Shut off <PRTPAGE P="158"/>valves shall not be installed between the vessel and the safety relief valves. Manifolds for mounting multiple relief valves may be fitted with acceptable interlocking shut off valves so arranged that the required capacity of discharge will be “lined up” at all times.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) Each safety relief valve shall be tested in the presence of a marine inspector before being placed in service except as noted otherwise in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The test shall satisfactorily show that the valve will start to discharge at the required minimum pressure.</P>
              <P>(2) Each safety relief valve fitted with a breaking pin and rupture disk need not be tested in the presence of a marine inspector before being placed in service. In lieu thereof, a certificate shall be furnished with the valve attested to by the manufacturer that the test requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section have been met.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Large conventional pressure vessels used to transport liquefied petroleum and natural gases, at “low temperatures” may often be difficult to thermally stress relieve. Where no other problem, such as corrosion exists, mechanical stress relief will be permitted for Class II-L pressure vessels.</P>
              <P>(b) Mechanical stress relief serves to cause small flaws, particularly in the weld zone, to yield plastically at the flaw tip resulting in a local relief of stress and a blunting of the crack tip. To achieve the maximum benefit from mechanical stress relief, it is necessary that the stresses so imposed be more severe than those expected in normal service life. At the same time, it is necessary that the stresses which are imposed are not so high as to result in appreciable deformation or general yielding.</P>
              <P>(c) The weld joint efficiencies as listed in table UW-12 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1) shall apply except that a minimum of spot radiography will be required. UW-12(c) of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code that permits omitting all radiography does not apply. Spot examination shall follow UW-52 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and, in addition, these vessels will be required to have radiographic examination of intersecting circumferential and longitudinal joints for a distance of at least 20 times the plate thickness from the junction. See 46 CFR 54.25-8 on spot radiography.</P>

              <P>(d) Severe cold forming will not be permitted unless thermal stress relief is used. For example, parts of the vessels which are individually cold formed, such as heads, must be thermally stress relieved, where the extreme fiber strain measured at the surface exceeds 5 percent as determined by:

              <SUBJECT>Limitations and requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Class II-L pressure vessels which require stress relief (see table 54.01-5(b)) may be mechanically stress relieved provided:</P>
              <P>(1) The steels from which they are fabricated do not specifically require thermal stress relief in UCS-56 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 54.01-1) and have a ratio of yield to ultimate tensile strength not greater than 0.8. For example: A-537 steels could be mechanically stress relieved.</P>
              <P>(2) Pressure difference across the shell is not greater than 100 pounds per square inch, thickness of shell is not greater than 1 inch, and the design temperature is not greater than 115 °F.</P>
              <P>(3) It will carry liquids of specific gravity no greater than 1.05.</P>
              <P>(4) Design details are sufficient to eliminate stress concentrators: Mechanical stress relief is not acceptable in designs involving the following types of welded connections shown in UW-16.1 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code:</P>

              <P>(i) Types l, m, n, and p because of nonintegral reinforcement. Type o will be acceptable provided the plate, nozzle, and reinforcement assembly are <PRTPAGE P="165"/>furnace stress relieved and the reinforcement is at least 6 inches or 10t, whichever is larger, from the plate head.</P>
              <P>(ii) Types d, e, and f because expansion and contraction stresses are concentrated at the junction points.</P>
              <P>(5) That no slip-on flanges in sizes greater than 2 inches are used.</P>
              <P>(6) The categories A and B joints are type one as described in table UW-12 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and all categories C and D joints are full penetration welds. See UW-3 of the ASME Code for definition of categories.</P>
              <P>(b) When a pressure vessel is to be mechanically stress relieved in accordance with § 54.30-10(a)(1), its maximum allowable working pressure will be 40 percent of the value which would otherwise be determined. However, an increase of this 40 percent factor may be permitted if the stress relief is carried out at a pressure higher than that required by § 54.30-10(a)(1) and an experimental strain analysis is carried out during stress relief. This evaluation should provide information as to the strains at the saddles, welded seams and nozzles as well as the body of the vessel. The hydrostatic pressure applied during stress relief should be such that, except in the case of welds, the stresses in the vessel shall closely approach but not exceed 90 percent of the yield stress of the material at the test temperature. The proposed experimental program should be submitted to the Commandant for approval prior to its use. Photo-elastic coating, strain gaging, or a brittle coating technique is suggested for the experimental analysis.</P>

Where the ambient temperature is below 70 °F., and use of water at that temperature is not practical, the minimum temperature for mechanical stress relief may be below 70 °F. but shall not be less than 50 °F. above service temperature.</P>
              <P>(3) The stress relief shall be at the required temperature and pressure and held for a period not less than 2 hours per inch of metal thickness, but in no case less than 2 hours.</P>
              <P>(b) It is considered preferable that mechanical stress relief be accomplished with the tanks in place on their saddles or supporting structure in the barge or ship in which they will be utilized. In any case, it is considered mandatory that the tank be supported only by its regular saddles or supporting structure, without any auxiliary or temporary supports.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requirement for analysis and computation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A stress analysis shall be performed to determine if the tank may be exposed to excessive loadings during the mechanical stress relief process. This analysis should include consideration of the local stresses in way of saddles or other supporting structure and additional bending stresses due to the weight of the pressurizing liquid particularly in areas of high stress concentration. While it is necessary that the general stress level during the process be in excess of the normal working level, the calculated maximum stress during test shall not exceed 90 percent of the yield strength of the material at test temperature. The supporting structure shall be analyzed to verify its adequacy.</P>
              <P>(b) In all cases where the tanks are mechanically stress relieved in place in the ship or barge and the tanks are designed to carry cargoes with a specific gravity less than 1.05, the ship or barge shall be shown to have adequate stability and buoyancy, as well as strength to carry the excess weight of the tank during the stress relief procedure.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Design conditions and criteria (modifies 101-104.7).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Maximum allowable working pressure.</E> (1) The maximum allowable working pressure of a piping system must not be greater than the internal design pressure defined in 104.1.2 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).</P>
              <P>(2) Where the maximum allowable working pressure of a system component, such as a valve or a fitting, is less than that computed for the pipe or tubing, the system pressure shall be limited to the lowest of the component maximum allowable working pressures.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Relief valves.</E> (<E T="03">modifies 101.2</E>). (1) Every system which may be exposed to pressures higher than the system's maximum allowable working pressure shall be safeguarded by appropriate relief devices. (See § 52.01-3 of this subchapter for definitions.) Relief valves are required at pump discharges except for centrifugal pumps so designed and applied that a pressure in excess of the maximum allowable working pressure for the system cannot be developed.</P>

              <P>(2) The relief valve setting shall not exceed the maximum allowable working pressure of the system. Its relieving capacity shall be sufficient to prevent the pressure from rising more than 20 percent above the system maximum allowable working pressure. The rated relieving capacity of safety and relief valves used in the protection of piping systems only shall be based on actual flow test data and the capacity shall be certified by the manufacturer <PRTPAGE P="178"/>at 120 percent of the set pressure of the valve.</P>
              <P>(3) Relief valves shall be certified as required in part 50 of this subchapter for valves, and shall also meet the requirements of § 54.15-10 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Ship motion dynamic effects</E> (<E T="03">replaces 101.5.3</E>). Piping system designs shall account for the effects of ship motion and flexure, including weight, yaw, sway, roll, pitch, heave, and vibration.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Ratings for pressure and temperature (modifies 102.2).</E> The material in 102.2 of ASME B31.1 applies, with the following exceptions:</P>
              <P>(1) The details of components not having specific ratings as described in 102.2.2 of ASME B31.1 must be furnished to the Marine Safety Center for approval.</P>
              <P>(1) The details of components not having specific ratings as described in 102.2.2 of ANSI B31.1 must be furnished to the Marine Safety Center for approval.</P>
              <P>(2) Boiler blowoff piping must be designed in accordance with § 56.50-40 of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Pressure design (modifies 102.3, 104.1.2, and 104.4).</E> (1) Materials for use in piping must be selected as described in § 56.60-1(a) of this part. Tabulated values of allowable stress for these materials must be measured as indicated in 102.3.1 of ASME B31.1 and in tables 56.60-1 and 56.60-2(a) of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Allowable stress values, as found in the ASME Code, which are restricted in application by footnote or are italicized shall not be used. Where multiple stresses are listed for a material, the lowest value of the listing shall be used unless otherwise approved by the Commandant. In all cases the temperature is understood to be the actual temperature of the component.</P>
              <P>(3) Where the operator desires to use a material not listed, permission must be obtained from the Commandant. Requirements for testing found in § 56.97-40(a)(2) and § 56.97-40(a)(4) may affect design and should be considered. Special design limitations may be found for specific systems. Refer to subpart 56.50 for specific requirements.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Intersections (modifies 104.3).</E> The material in 104.3 of ASME B31.1 is applicable with the following additions:</P>
              <P>(1) Reinforcement calculations where applicable shall be submitted.</P>
              <P>(2) Wherever possible the longitudinal joint of a welded pipe should not be pierced.</P>

              <P>(a) Each valve must close with a right-hand (clockwise) motion of the handwheel or operating lever as seen by one facing the end of the valve stem. Each gate, globe, and angle valve must generally be of the rising-stem type, preferably with the stem threads external to the valve body. Where operating conditions will not permit such installations, the use of a nonrising-stem valve will be acceptable. Each nonrising-stem valve, lever-operated valve, or other valve where, because of design, the position of the disc or closure mechanism is not obvious must be fitted with an indicator to show whether the valve is opened or closed, except as provided for in § 56.50-1(g)(2)(iii) of this part. No such indicator is required for any valve located in a tank or similar inaccessible space when indicators are available at accessible sites. The operating levers of each quarter-turn (rotary) valve must be parallel to the fluid flow when open and perpendicular to the fluid flow when closed.</P>

              <P>(b) Valves of Class I piping systems (for restrictions in other classes refer to sections on low temperature service), having diameters exceeding 2 inches must have bolted, pressure seal, or breech lock bonnets and flanged or welding ends, except that socket type welding ends shall not be used where prohibited by § 56.30-5(c) of this part, § 56.30-10(b)(4) of this part for the same pressure class, or elsewhere in this part. For diameters not exceeding 2 inches, screwed union bonnet or bolted bonnet, or bonnetless valves of a type which will positively prevent the stem from screwing out of the body may be employed. Outside screw and yoke design must be used for valves 3 inches and larger for pressures above 600 pounds per square inch gage. Cast iron valves with screwed-in or screwed-over bonnets are prohibited. Union bonnet type cast iron valves must have the bonnet ring made of steel, bronze, or malleable iron.<PRTPAGE P="183"/>

              <P>(c) Valves must be designed for the maximum pressure to which they may be subjected, but in no case shall the design pressure be less than 50 pounds per square inch gage. The use of wafer type resilient seated valves is not permitted for shell connections unless they are so arranged that the piping immediately inboard of the valve can be removed without affecting the watertight integrity of the shell connection. Refer also to § 56.20-15(b)(2)(iii) of this part. Large fabricated ballast manifold connecting lines exceeding 8 inches nominal pipe size must be designed for a pressure of not less than 25 pounds per square inch gage.</P>
              <P>(d) Disks or disk faces, seats, stems and other wearing parts of valves shall be made of material possessing corrosion and heat-resisting qualities suitable for the service conditions to which they may be subjected.</P>
              <P>(e) Plug cocks shall be constructed with satisfactory and positive means of preventing the plug from becoming loosened or removed from the body when the plug is operated. Cocks having plug locking arrangements depending on cotter pins are prohibited.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Positive shutoff valves.</E> The closed valve must pass less than 10 ml/hr (0.34 fluid oz/hr) of liquid or less than 3 l/hr (0.11 cubic ft/hr) of gas per inch nominal pipe size through the line after removal of all resilient material and testing at full rated pressure. Packing material must be fire resistant. Piping subject to internal head pressure from a tank containing oil must be fitted with positive shutoff valves located at the tank in accordance with § 56.50-60(d). Otherwise positive shutoff valves may be used in any location in lieu of a required Category A or Category B valve.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Category A valves.</E> The closed valve must pass less than the greater of 5 percent of its fully open flow rate or 15 percent divided by the square root of the nominal pipe size (NPS) of its fully open flow rate through the line after complete removal of all resilient seating material and testing at full rated pressure; as represented by the formula: (15% / SQRT × (NPS)) (Fully open flow rate). Category A valves may be used in any location except where positive shutoff valves are required by § 56.50-60(d). Category A valves are required in the following locations:</P>
              <P>(i) Valves at vital piping system manifolds;</P>
              <P>(ii) Isolation valves in cross-connects between two piping systems, at least one of which is a vital system, where failure of the valve in a fire would prevent the vital system(s) from functioning as designed.</P>
              <P>(iii) Valves providing closure for any opening in the shell of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Category B valves.</E> The closed valve will not provide effective closure of the line or will permit appreciable leakage from the valve after the resilient material is damaged or destroyed. Category B valves are not required to be tested and may be used in any location except where a Category A or positive shutoff valve is required.</P>

              <P>(c) If a valve designer elects to use either a calculation or actual fire testing instead of material removal and pressure testing, the calculation must employ ISA-S75.02 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) to determine the flow coefficient (C<E T="52">v</E>), or the fire testing must be conducted in accordance with API 607 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).</P>

The bilge pumping system shall be capable of operation under all practicable conditions after a casualty whether the ship is upright or listed. For this purpose wing suctions will generally be necessary except in narrow compartments at the ends of the vessel where one suction may be sufficient. In compartments of unusual form, additional suctions may be required.</P>
              <P>(2) Arrangements shall be made whereby water in the compartments will drain to the suction pipes. Efficient means shall be provided for draining water from all tank tops, other watertight flats and insulated holds. Peak tanks, chain lockers and decks over peak tanks may be drained by eductors, ejectors, or hand pumps. Where piping is led through the forepeak, see § 56.50-1(b).</P>
              <P>(3) Where drainage from particular compartments is considered undesirable, the provisions for such drainage may be omitted, provided it can be shown by calculations that the safety of the vessel will not be impaired.</P>
              <P>(4) Where the vessel is to carry Class 3 flammable liquids with a flashpoint below 23 °C (74 °F), Class 6, Division 6.1, poisonous liquids, or Class 8 corrosive liquids with a flashpoint below 23 °C (74 °F) as defined in 49 CFR part 173, in enclosed cargo spaces, the bilge-pumping system must be designed to ensure against inadvertent pumping of such liquids through machinery-space piping or pumps.</P>
              <P>(5) For each vessel constructed on or after June 9, 1995, and on an international voyage, arrangements must be made to drain the enclosed cargo spaces on either the bulkhead deck of a passenger vessel or the freeboard deck of a cargo vessel.</P>

              <P>(i) If the deck edge, at the bulkhead deck of a passenger vessel or the freeboard deck of a cargo vessel, is immersed when the vessel heels 5° or less, the drainage of the enclosed cargo <PRTPAGE P="199"/>spaces must discharge to a space, or spaces, of adequate capacity, each of which has a high-water-level alarm and a means to discharge overboard. The number, size and arrangement of the drains must prevent unreasonable accumulation of water. The pumping arrangements must take into account the requirements for any fixed manual or automatic sprinkling system. In enclosed cargo spaces fitted with carbon-dioxide extinguishing systems, the drains must have traps or other means to prevent escape of the smothering gas. The enclosed cargo spaces must not drain to machinery spaces or other spaces where sources of ignition may be present if water may be contaminated with Class 3 flammable liquids; Class 6, Division 6.1, poisonous liquids; or Class 8 corrosive liquids with a flashpoint below 23 °C (74 °F).</P>
              <P>(ii) If the deck edge, at the bulkhead deck of a passenger vessel or the freeboard deck of a cargo vessel, is immersed only when the vessel heels more than 5°, the drainage of the enclosed cargo spaces may be by means of a sufficient number of scuppers discharging overboard. The installation of scuppers must comply with § 42.15-60 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) Passenger vessels shall have provision made to prevent the compartment served by any bilge suction piping from being flooded in the event the pipe is severed or otherwise damaged by collision or grounding in any other compartment. Where the piping is located within one-fifth of the beam of the side of the vessel (measured at right angles to the centerline at the level of the deepest subdivision loadline or deepest loadline where a subdivision loadline is not assigned) or is in a ductkeel, a nonreturn valve shall be fitted to the end of the pipe in the compartment which it serves.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Each bilge suction must lead from a manifold except as otherwise approved by the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center. As far as practicable, each manifold must be in, or be capable of remote operation from, the same space as the bilge pump that normally takes suction on that manifold. In either case, the manifold must be capable of being locally controlled from above the floorplates and must be easily accessible at all times. As far as practicable, each overboard-discharge valve for a bilge system must comply with the requirements governing location and accessibility for suction manifolds. Except as otherwise permitted by paragraph (c)(4) of this section for a vessel employing a common-rail bilge system, each bilge-manifold valve controlling a bilge suction from any compartment must be of the stop-check type.</P>
              <P>(2) Each passenger vessel on an international voyage must comply with the provisions of SOLAS II-1/21.</P>

              <P>(i) The common-rail main runs inboard at least one-fifth of the beam of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(ii) A stop-check valve or both a stop valve and a check valve are provided in each branch line and located inboard at least one-fifth of the beam of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(iii) The stop valve or the stop-check valve is power-driven, is capable of remote operation from the space where the pump is, and, regardless of the status of the power system, is capable of manual operation to both open and close the valve.</P>
              <P>(iv) The stop valve or the stop-check valve is accessible for both manual operation and repair under all operating conditions, and the space used for access contains no expansion joint or flexible coupling that, upon failure, would cause flooding and prevent access to the valve.</P>
              <P>(v) A port and a starboard suction serve each space protected unless, under the worst conditions of list and trim and with liquid remaining after pumping, the vessel's stability remains acceptable, in accordance with subchapter S of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(vi) For each vessel designed for the carriage of combinations of both liquid and dry bulk cargoes (O/B/O), no bilge pump or piping is located in a machinery space other than in a pump room for cargo, and no liquid and other cargoes are carried simultaneously.<PRTPAGE P="200"/>
              </P>
              <P>(vii) For each cargo vessel in Great Lakes service, each common-rail piping for the bilge and ballast system serving cargo spaces, if installed and if connected to a dedicated common-rail bilge system, must lead separately from a valved manifold located at the pump.</P>
              <P>(d) The internal diameter of bilge suction pipes including strainers shall be determined by formulas (1) and (2), except that the nearest commercial size not more than one-fourth inch under the required diameter may be used.

              <P>(3) For vessels of 150 gross tons and over, no main suction piping shall be less than 2<FR>1/2</FR> inches internal diameter. Branch piping need not be more than 4 inches and shall not be less than 2 inches in diameter except for drainage of small pockets or spaces in which case 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch diameter may be used. For vessels less than 150 gross tons no bilge suction shall be less than 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches internal diameter and no branch piping shall be less than 1 inch nominal pipe size.</P>
              <P>(4) For vessels of 65 feet in length or less and not engaged on an international voyage, the bilge pipe sizes computed by Formulas (1) and (2) of this paragraph are not mandatory, but in no case shall the size be less than 1 inch nominal pipe size.</P>
              <P>(5) The number, location, and size of bilge suctions in the boiler and machinery compartments shall be determined when the piping plans are submitted for approval and shall be based upon the size of the compartments and the drainage arrangements.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Independent bilge suction.</E> One of the independent bilge pumps must have a suction of a diameter not less than that given by Formula (2) in paragraph (d) of this section that is led directly from the engine room bilge entirely independent of the bilge main, and on passenger vessels each independent bilge pump located in the machinery spaces must have such direct suctions from these spaces, except that not more than two pumps are required to have direct suctions from any one space. A suction that is led directly from a suitably located pump manifold may be considered to be independent of the bilge main. Where two direct suctions are required in any one compartment on passenger vessels, one suction must be located on each side of the compartment. If watertight bulkheads <PRTPAGE P="201"/>separate the engine and boiler rooms, a direct suction or suctions must be fitted to each compartment unless the pumps available for bilge service are distributed throughout these compartments, in which case at least one pump in each such compartment must be fitted with direct suction in its compartment. In a vessel with more than one hull, there must be one bilge pump that has an independent bilge suction in each hull. In a column stabilized mobile offshore drilling unit, the independent bilge suction must be from the pumproom bilge.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Emergency bilge suctions.</E> In addition to the independent bilge suction(s) required by paragraph (e) of this section, an emergency bilge suction must be provided in the machinery space for all self-propelled vessels as described in the following subparagraphs. Emergency suctions must be provided from pumps other than those required by § 56.50-55(a) of this part. Such suctions must have nonreturn valves, and must meet the following criteria as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(1) On passenger vessels propelled by steam and operating on an international voyage or on ocean, coastwise, or Great Lakes routes, the main circulating pump is to be fitted with a direct bilge suction for the machinery space. The diameter of such suctions shall not be less than two-thirds the diameter of the main sea injection. When it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that the main circulating pump is not suitable for emergency bilge service, a direct emergency bilge suction is to be led from the largest available independent power driven pump to the drainage level of the machinery space. The suction is to be of the same diameter as the main inlet of the pump used and the capacity of the pump shall exceed that of a required main bilge pump.</P>
              <P>(2) On passenger vessels propelled by internal combustion engines and operating on an international voyage or on ocean, coastwise, or Great Lakes routes, the largest available pump in the engine room is to be fitted with the direct bilge suction in the machinery space except that a required bilge pump may not be used. The area of the suction pipe is to be equal to the full suction inlet of the pump. The discharge capacity of the pump selected shall exceed the capacity of the required main bilge pump.</P>
              <P>(3) Vessels over 180 feet in length which are not passenger vessels and which operate on international voyages or in ocean, coastwise, or Great Lakes service, must be provided with a direct emergency bilge suction from any pump in the machinery space, except that a required bilge pump may not be used. The discharge capacity of the pump selected must exceed the capacity of the required main bilge pump and the area of the suction inlet is to be equal to the full suction inlet of the pump.</P>
              <P>(4) Vessels under 180 feet in length need not provide an emergency bilge suction, except that passenger vessels shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (f) (1) and (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Each vessel with more than one hull must have an emergency bilge suction in each hull.</P>
              <P>(6) Each column stabilized mobile offshore drilling unit must have—</P>
              <P>(i) An emergency bilge suction in each hull; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A remote control for the emergency pump and associated valves that can be operated from the ballast control room.</P>
              <P>(g) Each individual bilge suction shall be fitted with a suitable bilge strainer having an open area of not less than three times at of the suction pipe. In addition a mud box or basket strainer shall be fitted in an accessible position between the bilge suction manifold and the pump.</P>

              <P>(h) Pipes for draining cargo holds or machinery spaces must be separate from pipes which are used for filling or emptying tanks where water or oil is carried. Bilge and ballast piping systems must be so arranged as to prevent oil or water from the sea or ballast spaces from passing into cargo holds or machinery spaces, or from passing from one compartment to another, whether from the sea, water ballast, or oil tanks, by the appropriate installation of stop and non-return valves. The bilge and ballast mains must be fitted with separate control valves at the pumps. Except as allowed by paragraph <PRTPAGE P="202"/>(c)(4)(vii) of this section, piping for draining a cargo hold or machinery space must be separate from piping used for filling or emptying any tank where water or oil is carried. Piping for bilge and ballast must be arranged so as to prevent, by the appropriate installation of stop and non-return valves, oil or water from the sea or ballast spaces from passing into a cargo hold or machinery space, or from passing from one compartment to another, regardless of the source. The bilge and ballast mains must be fitted with separate control valves at the pumps.</P>
              <P>(i) Ballast piping shall not be installed to any hull compartment of a wood vessel. Where the carriage of liquid ballast in such vessels is necessary, suitable ballast tanks, structurally independent of the hull, shall be provided.</P>
              <P>(j) When dry cargo is to be carried in deep tanks, arrangement shall be made for disconnecting or blanking-off the oil and ballast lines, and the bilge suctions shall be disconnected or blanked-off when oil or ballast is carried. Blind flanges or reversible pipe fittings may be employed for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(k) Where bilge and ballast piping is led through tanks, except ballast piping in ballast tanks, means must be provided to minimize the risk of flooding of other spaces due to pipe failure within the tanks. In this regard, such piping may be in an oiltight or watertight pipe tunnel, or the piping may be of Schedule 80 pipe wall thickness, fitted with expansion bends, and all joints within the tanks are welded. Alternative designs may be installed as approved by the Marine Safety Center. Where a pipe tunnel is installed, the watertight integrity of the bulkheads must be maintained. No valve or fitting may be located within the tunnel if the pipe tunnel is not of sufficient size to afford easy access. These requirements need not be met provided the contents of the tank and piping system are chemically compatible and strength and stability calculations are submitted showing that crossflooding resulting from a pipe, the tank, and the spaces through which the piping passes will not seriously affect the safety of the ship, including the launching of lifeboats due to the ship's listing. Bilge lines led through tanks without a pipe tunnel must be fitted with nonreturn valves at the bilge suctions.</P>
              <P>(l) When bilge pumps are utilized for other services, the piping shall be so arranged that under any condition at least one pump will be available for drainage of the vessel through an overboard discharge, while the other pump(s) are being used for a different service.</P>
              <P>(m) All bilge pipes used in or under fuel storage tanks or in the boiler or machinery space, including spaces in which oil settling tanks or oil pumping units are located, shall be of steel or other acceptable material.</P>

              <P>(n) Oil pollution prevention requirements for bilge and ballast systems are contained in subpart B of part 155, title 33, Code of Federal Regulations.

              <SUBJECT>Systems containing oil.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) Oil-piping systems for the transfer or discharge of cargo or fuel oil must be separate from other piping systems as far as practicable, and positive means shall be provided to prevent interconnection in service.</P>
              <P>(2) Fuel oil and cargo oil systems may be combined if the cargo oil systems contain only Grade E oils and have no connection to cargo systems containing grades of oil with lower flash points or hazardous substances.</P>
              <P>(3) Pumps used to transfer oil must have no discharge connections to fire mains, boiler feed systems, or condensers unless approved positive means are provided to prevent oil from being accidentally discharged into any of the aforementioned systems.</P>
              <P>(b) When oil needs to be heated to lower its viscosity, heating coils must be properly installed in each tank.</P>
              <P>(1) Each drain from a heating coil as well as each drain from an oil heater must run to an open inspection tank or other suitable oil detector before returning to the feed system.</P>
              <P>(2) As far as practicable, no part of the fuel-oil system containing heated oil under pressure exceeding 180 KPa (26 psi) may be placed in a concealed position so that defects and leakage cannot be readily observed. Each machinery space containing a part of the system must be adequately illuminated.</P>

              <P>(c) Filling pipes may be led directly from the deck into the tanks or to a manifold in an accessible location permanently marked to indicate the tanks to which they are connected. A shutoff valve must be fitted at each filling end. Oil piping must not be led through accommodation spaces, except that low <PRTPAGE P="205"/>pressure fill piping not normally used at sea may pass through accommodation spaces if it is of steel construction, all welded, and not concealed.</P>
              <P>(d) Piping subject to internal head pressure from oil in the tank must be fitted with positive shutoff valves located at the tank.</P>
              <P>(1) Valves installed on the outside of the oil tanks must be made of steel, ductile cast iron ASTM A 395 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2), or a ductile nonferrous alloy having a melting point above 1,700 °F and must be arranged with a means of manual control locally at the valve and remotely from a readily accessible and safe location outside of the compartment in which the valves are located.</P>
              <P>(i) In the special case of a deep tank in any shaft tunnel, piping tunnel, or similar space, one or more valves must be fitted on the tank, but control in the event of fire may be effected by means of an additional valve on the piping outside the tunnel or similar space. Any such additional valve installed inside a machinery space must be capable of being operated from outside this space.</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(2) If valves are installed on the inside of the tank, they may be made of cast iron and arranged for remote control only. Additional valves for local control must be located in the space where the system exits from the tank or adjacent tanks. Valves for local control outside the tanks must be made of steel, ductile cast iron ASTM A 395 , or a ductile nonferrous alloy having a melting point above 1,700 °F.</P>

              <P>(i) Valve actuators must be capable of closing the valves under all conditions, except during physical interruption of the power system (e.g., cable breakage or tube rupture). Fluid power actuated valves, other than those opened against spring pressure, must be provided with an energy storage system which is protected, as far as practicable, from fire and collision. The storage system must be used for no other purpose and must have sufficient capacity to cycle all connected valves from the initial valve position to the opposite position and return. The cross connection of this system to an alternate power supply will be given special consideration by the Marine Safety Center.</P>
              <P>(ii) The valve shall have a local power actuator to both open and close the valve unless local manual opening operation will not prevent remote closing of the valve.</P>
              <P>(iii) The positioning of the valve by either the local or remote actuators shall not void the ability of the other actuator to close the valve.</P>
              <P>(iv) The valve shall be provided with a means of emergency manual operation to both open and close the valve regardless of the status of the power operating system. Such manual operation may interfere with the power operation, and if so, shall be protected from causal use by means of covers, locking devices, or other suitable means. Instructions and warnings regarding the emergency system shall be conspicuously posted at the valve.</P>
              <P>(4) Remote operation for shutoff valves on small independent oil tanks will be specially considered in each case where the size of tanks and their location may warrant the omission of remote operating rods.</P>
              <P>(e) Fuel oil tanks overhanging boilers are prohibited.</P>
              <P>(f) Valves for drawing fuel or draining water from fuel are not permitted in fuel oil systems except that a single valve may be permitted in the case of diesel driven machinery if suitably located within the machinery space away from any potential source of ignition.

              <P>(a) The lubricating oil system shall be designed to function satisfactorily when the vessel has a permanent 15° list and a permanent 5° trim.</P>
              <P>(b) When pressure or gravity-forced lubrication is employed for the steam driven main propelling machinery, an independent auxiliary lubricating pump shall be provided.</P>
              <P>(c) Oil coolers on steam driven machinery shall be provided with two separate means of circulating water through the coolers.</P>
              <P>(d) For internal combustion engine installations, the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be met, but they do not apply to vessels in river and harbor service, nor to any vessel below 300 gross tons. Where the size and design of an engine is such that lubrication before starting is not necessary and an attached pump is normally used, the independent auxiliary pump is not required if a duplicate of the attached pump is carried as spare. In meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section in the case of internal combustion engines, two separate means are to be provided for circulating coolant on those engines on which oil coolers are fitted. One of those means must be independently driven and may consist of a connection from a pump of adequate size normally used for other purposes utilizing the required coolant. Where the design of an engine will not readily accommodate an independent pump connection, the independent auxiliary pump will not be required if a duplicate of the attached pump is carried as a spare. Oil filters shall be provided on all internal combustion engine installations. On main propulsion engines which are fitted with full-flow type filters, the arrangement shall be such that the filters may be cleaned without interrupting the oil supply except that such an arrangement is not required on vessels having more than a single main propulsion engine.</P>
              <P>(e) The lubricating oil piping shall be independent of other piping systems and shall be provided with necessary coolers, heaters, filters, etc., for proper operation. Oil heaters shall be fitted with bypasses.</P>
              <P>(f) Diesel engine lubrication systems shall be so arranged that vapors from the sump tank may not be discharged back into the engine crank case of engines of the dry sump type.</P>

              <P>(a) This section applies to vents for all independent, fixed, non-pressure tanks or containers or for spaces in which liquids, such as fuel, ship's stores, cargo, or ballast, are carried.</P>
              <P>(1) The structural arrangement in double bottom and other tanks shall be such as to permit the free passage of air and gases from all parts of the tanks to vent pipes.</P>
              <P>(2) Tanks having a comparatively small surface, such as fuel oil settling tanks, need be fitted with only one vent pipe, but tanks having a comparatively large surface shall be fitted with at least two vent pipes. The vents shall be located so as to provide venting of the tanks under any service condition.</P>
              <P>(3) Vent pipes for fuel oil tanks shall, wherever possible, have a slope of no less than 30°. Header lines, where both ends are adequately drained to a tank, are excluded from this requirement.</P>
              <P>(4) Tank vents must extend above the weather deck, except vents from fresh water tanks, bilge oily-water holding tanks, bilge slop tanks, and tanks containing Grade E combustible liquids, such as lubricating oil, may terminate in the machinery space, provided—</P>
              <P>(i) The vents are arranged to prevent overflow on machinery, electrical equipment, and hot surfaces;</P>
              <P>(ii) Tanks containing combustible liquids are not heated; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The vents terminate above the deep load waterline if the tanks have boundaries in common with the hull.</P>
              <P>(5) Vents from oil tanks must terminate not less than three feet from any opening into living quarters.</P>
              <P>(6) Vents extending above the freeboard deck or superstructure deck from fuel oil and other tanks must be at least Schedule 40 in wall thickness. Except for barges in inland service and for Great Lakes vessels, the height from the deck to any point where water may gain access through the vent to below deck must be at least 30 inches (760mm) on the freeboard deck and 17<FR>1/2</FR> inches (450mm) on the superstructure deck. On Great Lakes vessels, the height from the deck to any point where water may gain access through the vent to below deck must be at least 30 inches (760mm) on the freeboard deck, 24 inches (610mm) on the raised quarterdeck, and 12 inches (305mm) on other superstructure decks. Where the height of vents on Great Lakes vessels may interfere with the working of the vessel, a lower height may be approved by the Marine Safety Center provided the vent cap is properly protected from mechanical damage. For barges in inland service, the vents must extend at least six inches above the deck. A lesser amount may be approved by the Marine Safety Center if evidence is provided that a particular vent has proven satisfactory in service.</P>
              <P>(7) Satisfactory means, permanently attached, shall be provided for closing the openings of all vents, except that barges in inland service may be exempted. Acceptable means of closure are:</P>
              <P>(i) A ball check valve where the ball float, normally in the open position, will float up and close under the action of a submerging wave. The valve shall be designed so that the effective clear discharge area through the valve with the float in the open position is not less than the inlet area of the vent pipe to which the valve is connected.</P>
              <P>(ii) A hinged closure normally open on the outlet of the return bend, which must close automatically by the force of a submerging wave; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Another suitable device acceptable to the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center.</P>

              <P>(8) Vent outlets from all tanks which may emit flammable or combustible vapors, such as bilge slop tanks and contaminated drain tanks, must be fitted with a single screen of corrosion-resistant wire of at least 30 by 30 mesh, or two screens of at least 20 by 20 mesh spaced not less than one-half inch <PRTPAGE P="211"/>(13mm) nor more than 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches (38mm) apart. The clear area through the mesh must not be less than the internal unobstructed area of the required pipe.</P>
              <P>(9) Where vents are provided with flame screens, the closure device shall be situated so as not to damage these screens.</P>
              <P>(10) The diameter of each vent pipe must not be less than 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches nominal pipe size for fresh water tanks, 2 inches nominal pipe size for water ballast tanks, and 2<FR>1/2</FR> inches nominal pipe size for fuel oil tanks, except that small independent tanks need not have a vent more than 25% greater in cross-sectional area than the fill line.</P>
              <P>(11)(i) If a tank may be filled by a pressure head exceeding that for which the tank is designed, the aggregate cross-sectional area of the vents in each tank must be not less than the cross-sectional area of the filling line unless the tank is protected by overflows, in which case the aggregate cross-sectional area of the overflows must be not less than the cross-sectional area of the filling line.</P>
              <P>(ii) Provision must be made to guard against liquids rising in the venting system to a height that would exceed the design head of a cargo tank or fuel-oil tank. It may be made by high-level alarms or overflow-control systems or other, equivalent means, together with gauging devices and procedures for filling cargo tanks.</P>
              <P>(12) Where deep tanks are intended for the occasional carriage of dry or liquid cargo, a “spectacle” or ring and blank flange may be fitted in the overflow pipe so arranged as not to interfere with venting when the tanks contain oil.</P>
              <P>(13) Vents from fresh water or water ballast tanks shall not be connected to a common header with vents from oil or oily ballast tanks.</P>
              <P>(b) Tank vents must remain within the watertight subdivision boundaries in which the tanks they vent are located. Where the structural configuration of a vessel makes meeting this requirement impracticable, the Marine Safety Center may permit a tank vent to penetrate a watertight subdivision bulkhead. All tank vents which penetrate watertight subdivision bulkheads must terminate above the weather deck.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sounding devices.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each tank must be provided with a suitable means of determining liquid level. Except for a main cargo tank on a tank vessel, each integral hull tank and compartment, unless at all times accessible while the vessel is operating, must be fitted with a sounding pipe.</P>
              <P>(b) Where sounding pipes terminate below the freeboard deck on cargo vessels, they shall be fitted with gate valves. On passenger vessels, where sounding pipes terminate below the bulkhead deck, they shall be fitted with self-closing gate valves.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as allowed by this paragraph, on each vessel constructed on or after June 9, 1995, no sounding pipe used in a fuel-oil tank may terminate in any space where the risk of ignition of spillage from the pipe might arise. None may terminate in a space for passengers or crew. When practicable, none may terminate in a machinery space. When the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center, determines it impracticable to avoid terminating a pipe in a machinery space, a sounding pipe may terminate in a machinery space if all the following requirements are met:</P>
              <P>(1) In addition to the sounding pipe, the fuel-oil tank has an oil-level gauge complying with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The pipe terminates in a place remote from ignition hazards unless precautions are taken such as fitting an effective screen (shield) to prevent the fuel oil, in case of spillage through the end of the pipe, from coming into contact with a source of ignition.</P>

              <P>(3) The end of the pipe is fitted with a self-closing blanking device and a small-diameter, self-closing control cock located below the blanking device for the purpose of ascertaining before the blanking device is opened that no fuel oil is present. Provision must be made to ensure that no spillage of fuel oil through the control cock involves an ignition hazard.<PRTPAGE P="212"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) On each vessel constructed on or after June 9, 1995, other oil-level gauges may be used instead of sounding pipes if all the following requirements are met:</P>
              <P>(1) In a passenger vessel, no such gauge may require penetration below the top of the tank, and neither the failure of a gauge nor an overfilling of the tank may permit release of fuel into the space.</P>
              <P>(2) In a cargo vessel, neither the failure of such a gauge nor an overfilling of the tank may permit release of fuel into the space. The use of cylindrical gauge-glasses is prohibited. The use of oil-level gauges with flat glasses and self-closing valves between the gauges and fuel tanks is acceptable.</P>
              <P>(e) The upper ends of sounding pipes terminating at the weather deck shall be closed by a screw cap or plug. Great Lakes dry cargo carriers may have the sounding pipes which service ballast water tanks terminate at least 4 inches above the deck if closure is provided by a tight fitting hinged cover making metal-to-metal contact with the hinge on the forward side. Positive means to secure these caps in the closed position shall be provided. Provision shall be made to prevent damage to the vessels' plating by the striking of the sounding rod.</P>
              <P>(f) On mobile offshore drilling units where installation of sounding pipes may not be practicable for some tanks, alternate means of determining liquid level may be used if approved by the Commandant.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Overboard discharges and shell connections.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) All inlets and discharges led through the vessel's side shall be fitted with efficient and accessible means, located as close to the hull penetrations as is practicable, for preventing the accidental admission of water into the vessel either through such pipes or in the event of fracture of such pipes.</P>
              <P>(2) The number of scuppers, sanitary discharges, tank overflows, and other similar openings in the vessel's side shall be reduced to a minimum, either by making each discharge serve for as many as possible of the sanitary and other pipes, or in any other satisfactory manner.</P>
              <P>(3) In general, when the bulkhead deck is above the freeboard deck, the requirements of this section apply relative to the bulkhead deck. For vessels not assigned load lines, such as certain inland vessels and barges, the weather deck shall be taken as the freeboard deck.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Scuppers and discharge pipes originating at any level and penetrating the shell either more than 17<FR>1/2</FR> inches (450mm) below the freeboard deck or less than 23<FR>1/2</FR> inches (600mm) above the summer load waterline must be provided with an automatic nonreturn valve at the shell. This valve, unless required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, may be omitted if the piping is not less than Schedule 80 in wall thickness for nominal pipe sizes through 8 inches, Schedule 60 for nominal pipe sizes above 8 inches and below 16 inches, and Schedule 40 for nominal pipe sizes 16 inches and above.</P>

              <P>(2) Discharges led through the shell originating either from spaces below the freeboard deck or from within enclosed superstructures and equivalent deckhouses on the freeboard deck as defined in § 42.13-15(i) of subchapter E (Load Lines) of this chapter, shall be fitted with efficient and accessible means for preventing water from passing inboard. Normally each separate discharge shall have one automatic nonreturn valve with a positive means of closing it from a position above the freeboard deck. Where, however, the vertical upward distance from the summer load line to the inboard end of the discharge pipe through which flooding can take place exceed 0.01L, the discharge may have two automatic nonreturn valves without positive means of closing, provided that the inboard valve is always accessible for examination under service conditions. Where that vertical distance exceeds 0.02L a single automatic nonreturn valve without positive means of closing is acceptable. In an installation where the two automatic nonreturn valves are used, the inboard valve must be above the tropical load line. The means for operating the positive action valve shall be <PRTPAGE P="213"/>readily accessible and provided with an indicator showing whether the valve is open or closed. A suitable arrangement shall be made to insure the valve is not closed by unauthorized persons, and a notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place at the operating station to the effect that the valve shall not be closed except as required in an emergency.</P>
              <P>(3) Where scuppers and drains are installed in superstructures or deckhouses not enclosed as defined in § 42.13-15(j) of subchapter E (Load Lines) of this chapter, they shall be led overboard. Refer to paragraph (b)(1) of this section for any nonreturn valve requirement.</P>
              <P>(4) Sanitary pump discharges leading directly overboard or via a holding tank must meet the standards prescribed by this paragraph. The location of the sanitary system openings within the vessel determines whether the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section are applicable.</P>
              <P>(c) Overflow pipes which discharge through the vessel's side must be located as far above the deepest load line as practicable and fitted with valves as required by paragraph (b) of this section. Two automatic nonreturn valves must be used unless it is impracticable to locate the inboard valve in an accessible position, in which case a nonreturn valve with a positive means of closure from a position above the freeboard deck will be acceptable. Overflows which extend at least 30 inches above the freeboard deck before discharging overboard may be fitted with a single automatic nonreturn valve at the vessel's side. Overflow pipes which serve as tank vents must not be fitted with positive means of closure without the specific approval of the Marine Safety Center. Overflow pipes may be vented to the weather.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Sea inlets and discharges, such as used in closed systems required for the operation of main and auxiliary machinery, as in pump connections or scoop injection heat exchanger connections, need not meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section but instead shall be fitted with a shutoff valve located as near the shell plating as practicable, and may be locally controlled if the valve is located in a manned machinery space. These controls shall be readily accessible above the floor plates and shall be provided with indication showing whether the valve is opened or closed. Manned machinery spaces include the main machinery space and are either attended by the crew or are automated in accordance with part 62 of this subchapter to be comparable to an attended space.</P>
              <P>(2) In unmanned machinery spaces, all machinery inlets and discharges as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be remotely operable from a position above the freeboard deck unless otherwise approved and shall meet the access and marking requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) Pipes terminating at the shell plating shall be fitted with bends or elbows between the outboard openings and the first rigid connection inboard. In no case shall such pipes be fitted in a direct line between the shell opening and the first inboard connection.</P>
              <P>(2) Seachests and other hull fittings shall be of substantial construction and as short as possible. They shall be located as to minimize the possibility of being blocked or obstructed.</P>
              <P>(3) The thickness of inlet and discharge connections outboard of the shutoff valves, and exclusive of seachests, must be not less than that of Schedule 80 for nominal pipe sizes through 8 inches, Schedule 60 for nominal pipe sizes above 8 inches and below 16 inches, and Schedule 40 for nominal pipe sizes 16 inches and above.</P>

              <P>(f) Valves required by this section and piping system components outboard of such required valves on new vessel installations or replacements in vessels of 150 gross tons and over shall be of a steel, bronze, or ductile cast iron specification listed in Table 56.60-1(a). Lead or other heat sensitive materials having a melting point of 1,700 °F. or less shall not be used in such service, or in any other application where the deterioration of the piping system in the event of fire would give rise to danger of flooding. Brittle materials such as cast iron shall not be used in such service. Where nonmetallic materials are used in a piping system, and <PRTPAGE P="214"/>shell closures are required by this section, a positive closure metallic valve is required (see also § 56.60-25).</P>
              <P>(g) The inboard openings of ash and rubbish-chute discharges shall be fitted with efficient covers. If the inboard opening is located below the freeboard deck, the cover shall be watertight, and in addition, an automatic nonreturn valve shall be fitted in the chute in any easily accessible position above the deepest load line. Means shall be provided for securing both the cover and the valve when the chute is not in use. When ash-ejectors or similar expelling devices located in the boilerroom have the inboard openings below the deepest load line, they shall be fitted with efficient means for preventing the accidental admission of water. The thickness of pipe for ash ejector discharge shall be not less than Schedule 80.</P>
              <P>(h) Where deck drains, soil lines, and sanitary drains discharge through the shell in way of cargo tanks on tank vessels, the valves required by this section shall be located outside the cargo tanks. These valves shall meet the material requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. The piping led through such tanks shall be fitted with expansion bends where required, and shall be of steel pipe having a wall thickness of not less than five-eighths inch, except that the use of suitable corrosion-resistant material of lesser thickness will be given special consideration by the Commandant. All pipe joints within the tanks shall be welded. Soil lines and sanitary drains which pass through cargo tanks shall be provided with nonreturn valves with positive means of closing or other suitable means for preventing the entrance of gases into living quarters.</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided for in § 58.20-20(c) of this chapter, sea valves must not be held open with locks. Where it is necessary to hold a discharge or intake closed with a lock, either a locking valve may be located inboard of the sea valve, or the design must be such that there is sufficient freedom of motion to fully close the locked sea valve after an event, such as fire damage to the seat, causes significant leakage through the valve. Valves which must be opened in and emergency, such as bilge discharges or fire pump suctions must not be locked closed, whether they are sea valves or not.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) The material requirements in this subpart shall be followed in lieu of those in 123 in ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).</P>

              <P>(2) Materials used in piping systems must be selected from the specifications that appear in Table 56.60-1(a) of this section or 46 CFR 56.60-2, Table 56.60-2(a), or they may be selected from the material specifications of sections I or VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (both incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) if not prohibited by a regulation of this subchapter dealing with the particular <PRTPAGE P="219"/>section of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Table 56.60-1(a) of this section contains only pipe, tubing, and fitting specifications. Determination of acceptability of plate, forgings, bolting, nuts, and castings may be made by reference to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code as previously described. Additionally, accepted materials for use as piping system components appear in 46 CFR 56.60-2, Table 56.60-2(a). Materials conforming to specifications not described in this subparagraph must receive the specific approval of the Marine Safety Center before being used. Materials listed in Table 126.1 of ASME B31.1 are not accepted unless specifically permitted by this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(b) Components made in accordance with the commercial standards listed in Table 56.60-1(b) of this section and made of materials complying with paragraph (a) this section may be used in piping systems within the limitations of the standards and within any further limitations specified in this subchapter.</P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>Table 56.60-1(a) replaces Table 126.1 in ASME B31.1 and sets forth specifications of pipes, tubing, and fittings intended for use in piping-systems. The first column lists acceptable standards from ASTM (all incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2); the second lists those from ASME (all incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2). The Coast Guard will consider use of alternative pipes, tubing, and fittings when it receives certification of their mechanical properties. Without this certification it will restrict use of such alternatives to piping-systems inside heat exchangers that ensure containment of the material inside pressure shells.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preparation (modifies 127.3).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Butt welds (reproduces 127.3)</E>—(1) <E T="03">End preparation.</E> (i) Oxygen or arc cutting is acceptable only if the cut is reasonably smooth and true, and all slag is cleaned from the flame cut surfaces. Discoloration which may remain on the flame cut surface is not considered to be detrimental oxidation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Butt-welding end preparation dimensions contained in ASME B16.25 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) or any other end preparation that meets the procedure qualification requirements are acceptable.</P>
              <P>(iii) If piping component ends are bored, such boring shall not result in the finished wall thickness after welding being less than the minimum design thickness. Where necessary, weld metal of the appropriate analysis may be deposited on the inside or outside of the piping component to provide sufficient material for machining to insure satisfactory fitting of rings.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the piping component ends are upset they may be bored to allow for a completely recessed backing ring, provided the remaining net thickness of the finished ends is not less than the minimum design thickness.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Cleaning.</E> Surfaces for welding shall be clean and shall be free from paint, oil, rust, scale, or other material which is detrimental to welding.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Alignment.</E> The inside diameters of piping components to be joined must be aligned as accurately as practicable within existing commercial tolerances on diameters, wall thicknesses, and out of roundness. Alignment must be preserved during welding. Where ends are to be joined and the internal misalignment exceeds <FR>1/16</FR>-inch, it is preferred that the component with the wall extending internally be internally trimmed (see Fig. 127.3) so that adjoining internal surfaces are approximately <PRTPAGE P="229"/>flush. However, this trimming must not reduce a piping component wall thickness below the minimum design thickness and the change in the contour may not exceed 30°.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Spacing.</E> The root opening of the joint shall be as given in the procedure specification.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Fillet welds (modifies 127.4.4).</E> In making fillet welds, the weld metal must be deposited in such a way as to obtain adequate penetration into the base metal at the root of the weld. Piping components that are to be joined utilizing fillet welds must be prepared in accordance with applicable provisions and requirements of this section. For typical details, see Figures 127.4.4A and 127.4.4C of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) and 46 CFR 56.30-10(b). See 46 CFR 56.30-5(d) for additional requirements.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 56.70-15</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Qualification of the welding procedures to be used, and of the performance of welders and operators, is required, and shall comply with the requirements of part 57 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(2) No welding shall be done if there is direct impingement of rain, snow, sleet, or high wind on the piping component weldment.</P>
              <P>(3) Sections of pipe shall be welded insofar as possible in the fabricating shop. Prior to welding Class I piping or low temperature piping, the fabricator shall request a marine inspector to visit his plant to examine his fabricating equipment and to witness the qualification tests required by part 57 of this subchapter. One test specimen shall be prepared for each process and welding position to be employed in the fabrication.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Girth butt welds.</E> (1) Girth butt welds must be complete penetration welds and may be made with a single vee, double vee, or other suitable type of groove, with or without backing rings or consumable inserts.</P>
              <P>(2) Girth butt welds in Class I, I-L, and II-L piping systems shall be double welded butt joints or equivalent single welded butt joints for pipe diameters exceeding three-fourth inch nominal pipe size. The use of a single welded butt joint employing a backing ring (note restrictions in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section) on the inside of the pipe is an acceptable equivalent for Class I and Class II-L applications, but not permitted for Class I-L applications. Single welded butt joints employing either an inert gas for first pass backup or a consumable insert ring may be considered the equivalent of a double welded butt joint for all classes of piping and is preferable for Class I-L and II-L systems where double butt welds cannot be used. Appropriate welding procedure qualification tests shall be conducted as specified in part 57 of this subchapter. A first pass inert gas backup is intended to mean that the inside of the pipe is purged with inert gas and that the root is welded with the inert gas metal arc (mig) or inert gas tungsten arc (tig) processes. Classes I, I-L, and II-L piping are required to have the inside of the pipe machined for good fit up if the misalignment exceeds that specified in § 56.70-10(a)(3). In the case of Class II piping the machining of the inside of the pipe may be omitted. For single welded joints, where possible, the inside of the joint shall be examined visually to assure full penetration. Radiographic examination of at least 20 percent of single welded joints to check for penetration is required for all Class I and Class I-L systems regardless of size following the requirements of § 56.95-10. Ultrasonic testing may be utilized in lieu of radiographic examination if the procedures are approved.</P>
              <P>(3) For Class II piping, the type of joints shall be similar to Class I piping, with the following exceptions:</P>
              <P>(i) Single-welded butt joints may be employed without the use of backing rings in all sizes provided that the weld is chipped or ground flush on the root side of the weld.</P>
              <P>(ii) For services such as vents, overflows, and gravity drains, the backing ring may be eliminated and the root of the weld need not be ground.</P>

              <P>(iii) Square-groove welds without edge preparation may be employed for butt joints in vents, overflows, and <PRTPAGE P="230"/>gravity drains where the pipe wall thickness does not exceed three-sixteenth inch.</P>
              <P>(iv) The crimped or forged backing ring with continuous projection around the outside of the ring is acceptable only for Class II piping. The projection must be completely fused.</P>
              <P>(4) Tack welds which become part of the finished weld, shall be made by a qualified welder. Tack welds made by an unqualified welder shall be removed. Tack welds which are not removed shall be made with an electrode which is the same as or equivalent to the electrode to be used for the first pass. Their stopping and starting ends must be properly prepared by grinding or other suitable means so that they may be satisfactorily incorporated into the final weld. Tack welds which have cracked shall be removed.</P>
              <P>(5) When components of different outside diameters are welded together, the weld joint must be filled to the outside surface of the component having the larger diameter. There must be a gradual transition, not exceeding a slope of 1:3, in the weld between the two surfaces. To avoid unnecessary weld deposit, the outside surface of the component having the larger diameter must be tapered at an angle not to exceed 30 degrees with the axis of the pipe. (See Fig. 127.4.2 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).)</P>
              <P>(6) As-welded surfaces are permitted; however, the surface of the welds must be sufficiently free from coarse ripple, grooves, overlaps, abrupt ridges and valleys to meet the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The surface condition of the finished welds must be suitable for the proper interpretation of radiographic and other nondestructive examinations when nondestructive examinations are required by § 56.95-10. In those cases where there is a question regarding the surface condition on the interpretation of a radiographic film, the film must be compared to the actual weld surface for interpretation and determination of acceptability.</P>
              <P>(ii) Reinforcements are permitted in accordance with Table 56.70-15.</P>
              <P>(iii) Undercuts must not exceed <FR>1/32</FR>-inch and must not encroach on the minimum required section thickness.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the surface of the weld requires grinding to meet the above criteria, care must be taken to avoid reducing the weld or base material below the minimum required thickness.</P>
              <P>(7) The type and extent of examination required for girth butt welds is specified in § 56.95-10.</P>
              <P>(8) Sections of welds that are shown by radiography or other examination to have any of the following type of imperfections shall be judged unacceptable and shall be repaired as provided in paragraph (f) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) Any type of crack or zone of incomplete fusion or penetration.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any slag inclusion or porosity greater in extent than those specified as acceptable set forth in PW-51 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).</P>
              <P>(iii) Undercuts in the external surfaces of butt welds which are more than <FR>1/32</FR>-inch deep.</P>
              <P>(iv) Concavity on the root side of full penetration girth butt welds where the resulting weld thickness is less than the minimum pipe wall thickness required by this subchapter. Weld reinforcement up to a maximum of <FR>1/32</FR>-inch thickness may be considered as pipe wall thickness in such cases.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Longitudinal butt welds.</E> Longitudinal butt welds in piping components not made in accordance with the standards and specifications listed in 56.60-1 (a) and (b) must meet the requirements of paragraph 104.7 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) and may be examined nondestructively by an acceptable method. Imperfections shall not exceed the limits established for girth butt welds except that no undercutting shall be permitted in longitudinal butt welds. See also § 56.60-2(b).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Fillet welds.</E> (1) Fillet welds may vary from convex to concave. The size of a fillet weld is determined as shown in Figure 127.4.4A in ASME B31.1. Fillet weld details for socket-welding components must meet § 56.30-5(c) of this part. Fillet weld details for flanges must meet § 56.30-10(c) of this part. Fillet weld details for flanges must meet § 56.30-10 of this part.</P>

              <P>(2) The limitations on cracks and undercutting set forth in paragraph (b)(8) <PRTPAGE P="231"/>of this section for girth welds are also applicable to fillet welds.</P>
              <P>(3) Class I piping not exceeding 3 inches nominal pipe size and not subject to full radiography by § 56.95-10 of this part may be joined by sleeves fitted over pipe ends or by socket type joints. Where full radiography is required, only butt type joints may be used. The inside diameter of the sleeve must not exceed the outside diameter of the pipe or tube by more than 0.080 inch. Fit between socket and pipe must conform to applicable standards for socket weld fittings. Depth of insertion of pipe or tube within the socket or sleeve must not be less than three-eighths inch. The fillet weld must be deposited in a minimum of two passes, unless specifically approved otherwise in a special procedure qualification. Requirements for joints employing socket weld and slip-on flanges are in § 56.30-10 of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) Sleeve and socket type joints may be used in Class II piping systems without restriction as to size of pipe or tubing joined. Applicable standards must be followed on fit. The fillet welds must be deposited in a minimum of two passes, unless specifically approved otherwise in a special procedure qualification. Requirements for joints employing socket weld and slip-on flanges are in § 56.30-10 of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Seal welds (reproduces 127.4.5).</E> (1) Where seal welding of threaded joints is performed, threads shall be entirely covered by the seal weld. Seal welding shall be done by qualified welders.</P>
              <P>(2) The limitation on cracks and undercutting set forth in § 56.70-15(b)(8) for girth welds are also applicable to seal welds.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Weld defect repairs.</E> (1) All defects in welds requiring repair must be removed by a flame or arc-gouging, grinding, chipping, or machining. Repair welds must be made in accordance with the same procedures used for original welds, or by another welding process if it is a part of a qualified procedure, recognizing that the cavity to be repaired may differ in contour and dimensions from the original joint. The types, extent, and method of examination and limits of imperfections of repair welds shall be the same as for the original weld.</P>
              <P>(2) Preheating may be required for flame-gouging or arc-gouging certain alloy materials of the air hardening type in order to prevent surface checking or cracking adjacent to the flame or arc-gouged surface.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Welded branch connections.</E> (1) Figure 127.4.8A, Figure 127.4.8B, and Figure 127.4.8C of ASME B31.1 show typical details of branch connections with and without added reinforcement. However, no attempt has been made to show all acceptable types of construction and the fact that a certain type of construction is illustrated does not indicate that it is recommended over other types not illustrated. See also Figure 56.70-15(g) for additional pipe connections.</P>
              <P>(2) Figure 127.4.8D of ASME B31.1 shows basic types of weld attachments used in the fabrication of branch connections. The location and minimum size of these attachment welds shall conform to the requirements of this paragraph. Weld sizes shall be calculated in accordance with 104.3.1 of ASME B31.1, but shall not be less than the sizes shown in Figure 127.4.8D and F of ASME B31.1.</P>

                <P>(1) Not applicable to dissimilar metal welds.</P>
                <P>(2) When postheat treatment by annealing or normalizing is used, the postheat treatment temperatures must be in accordance with the qualified welding procedure.</P>
                <P>(3) Wall thickness of a butt weld is defined as the thicker of the two abutting ends after end preparation including I.D. machining.</P>
                <P>(4) The thickness of socket, fillet, and seal welds is defined as the throat thicknesses for pressure and nonpressure retaining welds.</P>
                <P>(5) Preheat temperatures must be checked by use of temperature indicating crayons, thermocouple pyrometers, or other suitable method.</P>
                <P>(6) For inert gas tungsten arc root pass welding lower preheat in accordance with the qualified procedure may be used.</P>
                <P>(7) The maximum postheat treatment temperature listed for each P number is a recommended maximum temperature.</P>
                <P>(8) Postheat treatment temperatures must be checked by use of thermocouple pyrometers or other suitable means.</P>
                <P>(9) Heating rate for furnace, gas, electric resistance, and other surface heating methods must not exceed: (i) 600 °F per hour for thicknesses 2 inches and under.</P>
                <P>(ii) 600 °F per hour divided by <FR>1/2</FR> the thickness in inches for thickness over 2 inches.</P>

                <P>(ii) The weld is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The required preheat is resumed before welding is continued.</P>
                <P>(16) When attaching welding carbon steel non-pressure parts to steel pressure parts and the throat thickness of the fillet or partial or full penetration weld is <FR>1/2</FR> in. or less, postheat treatment of the fillet weld is not required for Class I and II piping if preheat to a minimum temperature of 175 °F is applied when the thickness of the pressure part exceeds <FR>3/4</FR> in.</P>
                <P>(17) For Class I-L and II-L piping systems, relief from postweld heat treatment may not be dependent upon wall thickness. See also §§ 56.50-105(a)(3) and 56.50-105(b)(3) of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Postheat treatment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Where pressure retaining components having different thicknesses are welded together as is often the case when making branch connections, the preheat and postheat treatment requirements of Table 56.85-10 apply to the thicker of the components being joined. Postweld heat treatment is required for Classes I, I-L, II-L, and systems. It is not required for Class II piping. Refer to § 56.50-105(a)(3) for exceptions in Classes I-L and II-L systems and to paragraph (b) of this section for Class I systems.</P>
              <P>(b) All buttwelded joints in Class I piping shall be postweld heated as required by Table 56.85-10. The following exceptions are permitted:</P>
              <P>(1) High pressure salt water piping systems used in tank cleaning operations; and,</P>
              <P>(2) Gas supply piping of carbon or carbon molybdenum steel used in gas turbines.</P>
              <P>(c) All complicated connections including manifolds shall be stress-relieved in a furnace as a whole as required by Table 56.85-10 before being taken aboard ship for installation.</P>
              <P>(d) The postheating treatment selected for parts of an assembly must not adversely affect other components. Heating a fabricated assembly as a complete unit is usually desirable; however, the size or shape of the unit or the adverse effect of a desired treatment on one or more components where dissimilar materials are involved may dictate alternative procedures. For example, it may be heated as a section of the assembly before the attachment of others or local circumferential-band heating of welded joints in accordance with 46 CFR 56.85-10, Table 56.85-10 Note (12) and 46 CFR 56.85-15(j)(3).</P>
              <P>(e) Postheating treatment of welded joints between dissimilar metals having different postheating requirements must be established in the qualified welding procedure.</P>
              <P>(f)-(h) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(i) For those materials listed under P-1, when the wall thickness of the thicker of the two abutting ends, after their preparation, is less than three-fourths inch, the weld needs no postheating treatment. In all cases, where the nominal wall thickness is three-fourths inch or less, postheating treatment is not required.</P>
              <P>(j) (1)-(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(3) In local postheat treatment the entire band must be brought up to uniform specified temperature over the complete circumference of the pipe section, with a gradual diminishing of the temperature outward from the edges of the band.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The types and extent of nondestructive examinations required for piping must be in accordance with this section and Table 136.4 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2). In addition, a visual examination shall be made.</P>
              <P>(1) 100 percent radiography <SU>1</SU> is required for all Class I, I-L, and II-L piping with wall thickness equal to or greater than 10 mm (.375 in.).</P>
              <P>(2) Nondestructive examination is required for all Class II piping equal to or greater than 18 inches nominal diameter regardless of wall thickness. Any test method acceptable to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection may be used.</P>
              <P>(3) Appropriate nondestructive examinations of other piping systems are required only when deemed necessary by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. In such cases a method of testing satisfactory to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection must be selected from those described in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Visual examination.</E> Visual examination consists of observation by the marine inspector of whatever portions <PRTPAGE P="239"/>of a component or weld are exposed to such observation, either before, during, or after manufacture, fabrication, assembly or test. All welds, pipe and piping components shall be capable of complying with the limitations on imperfections specified in the product specification under which the pipe or component was purchased, or with the limitations on imperfections specified in § 56.70-15(b) (7) and (8), and (c), as applicable.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Nondestructive types of examinations</E>—(1) <E T="03">100 Percent radiography.</E> Where 100 percent radiography <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> is required for welds in piping, each weld in the piping shall be completely radiographed. If a butt weld is examined by radiography, for either random or 100 percent radiography, the method used shall be as follows:</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> Where for some reason, such as joint configuration, radiography is not applicable, another approved examination may be utilized.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(i) X-ray or gamma ray method of radiography may be used. The selection of the method shall be dependent upon its adaptability to the work being radiographed. The procedure to be followed shall be as indicated in PW-51 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).</P>
              <P>(ii) If a piping component or a weld other than a butt weld is radiographed, the method used shall be in accordance with UW-51 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Random radiography.</E> Where random radiography <SU>1</SU> is required, one or more welds may be completely or partially radiographed. Random radiography is considered to be a desirable means of spot checking welder performance, particularly in field welding where conditions such as position, ambient temperatures, and cleanliness are not as readily controlled as in shop welding. It is to be employed whenever an Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection questions a pipe weld not otherwise required to be tested. The standards of acceptance are the same as for 100 percent radiography.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Ultrasonic.</E> Where 100 percent ultrasonic testing is specified, the entire surface of the weld being inspected shall be covered using extreme care and careful methods to be sure that a true representation of the actual conditions is obtained. The procedures to be used shall be submitted to the Commandant for approval.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Liquid penetrant.</E> Where liquid penetrant examination is required, the entire surface of the weld being examined shall be covered. The examination shall be performed in accordance with appendix VIII to section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The following standards of acceptance shall be met:</P>
              <P>(i) All linear discontinuities and aligned penetrant indications revealed by the test shall be removed. Aligned penetrant indications are those in which the average of the center-to-center distances between any one indication and the two adjacent indications in any straight line is less than three-sixteenths inch. All other discontinuities revealed on the surface need not be removed unless the discontinuities are also revealed by radiography, in which case the pertinent radiographic specification shall apply.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Magnetic particle.</E> Where magnetic particle testing is required, the entire surface of the weld being examined shall be covered. The testing shall be performed in accordance with appendix VI to section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The following standards of acceptance are required for welds. All linear discontinuities and aligned indications revealed by the test shall be removed. Aligned indications are those in which the average of the center-to-center distances between any one indication and the two adjacent indications in any straight line is less than three-sixteenths inch. All other revealed discontinuities need not be removed unless the discontinuities are also revealed by radiography, in which case the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be met.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Leak tightness.</E> It is mandatory that the design, fabrication and erection of piping constructed under the regulations in this subchapter demonstrate leak tightness. Except where otherwise permitted in this subpart, this requirement must be met by a hydrostatic leak test prior to initial operations. Where a hydrostatic test is not practicable, a pneumatic test (§ 56.97-35) or initial service leak test (§ 56.97-38) may be substituted if approved by the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(1) At no time during the hydrostatic test may any part of the piping system be subjected to a stress greater than 90 percent of its yield strength (0.2 percent offset) at test temperature.</P>
              <P>(2) Pneumatic tests may be used in lieu of the required hydrostatic test (except as permitted in paragraph (b)(3) of this section), only when—</P>
              <P>(i) Piping subassemblies or systems are so designed or supported that they cannot be safely filled with water; <SU>1</SU>

                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> These tests may be made with the item being tested partially filled with water, if desired.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(ii) Piping subassemblies or systems are to be used in services where traces of the testing medium cannot be tolerated and, whenever possible, the piping subassemblies or system have been previously hydrostatically tested to the pressure required in § 56.97-30(e).</P>

              <P>(3) A pneumatic test at a pressure not to exceed 25 psig may be applied before a hydrostatic or a pneumatic test as a means of locating major leaks. The preliminary pneumatic test must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of § 56.97-35.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>Compressed gas is hazardous when used as a testing medium. It is, therefore, recommended that special precautions for protection of personnel be taken whenever gas under pressure is used as the test medium.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>(4) The hydrostatic test of the piping system, when conducted in accordance with the requirements of this part, is acceptable as the test for piping subassemblies and may also be used in lieu of any such test required by the material specification for material used in the piping subassembly or system provided the minimum test pressure required for the piping system is met, except where the installation would prevent performing any nondestructive examination required by the material specification to be performed subsequent to the hydrostatic or pneumatic test.</P>

              <P>(a) An initial service leak test and inspection is acceptable when other types of test are not practical or when leak tightness is conveniently demonstrable due to the nature of the service. One example is turbine extraction piping where shut-off valves are not available for isolating a line and where temporary closures are impractical. Others may be systems for service water, low pressure condensate, plant and instrument air, etc., where checking out of pumps and compressors afford ample opportunity for leak tightness inspection prior to fullscale operation.</P>
              <P>(b) The piping system must be gradually brought up to design pressure. After inspection of the piping system has proven that the installation is complete and all joints are leak-tight, the piping has met the requirements of § 56.97-1.</P>

              <P>(a) Repairs to boilers or pressure vessels in service may be performed by welding provided the welding meets the applicable requirements of part 57 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(b) No repairs by welding shall be made except temporary emergency repairs without prior approval of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. Emergency repairs shall be replaced with permanent repairs meeting the requirements of this subchapter when the vessel returns to a port in which an Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, is located except in the case of minor repairs which in the opinion of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, do not materially affect the safety of the boiler or pressure vessel.</P>
              <P>(c) Repair welding of power boilers, not meeting the requirements of subpart 52.05 of this subchapter, is prohibited unless the stress is carried by such other type(s) of construction complying with the requirements of this subchapter, and where the adequacy of the boiler design is not solely dependent upon the strength of the welds.</P>

              <P>(d) Only welded repairs as specified in this subchapter are permitted on boilers and pressure vessels. The welding repairs allowed by this subpart apply only to boilers and pressure vessels fabricated of carbon steel. Welding repairs to boilers and pressure vessels fabricated of alloy steel will be given special consideration by the Commandant. Such other method of repairs by means of welding not covered in this subchapter shall be referred to the Commandant and may be authorized by <PRTPAGE P="286"/>him, if in his opinion, it meets the intent of this subchapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Cracks.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Cracks extending from the calking edge of plates to the rivet holes of circumferential joints may be welded provided the cracks are veed out so that complete penetration of the weld metal is secured.</P>
              <P>(b) Circumferential cracks from rivet hole to rivet hole in girth joints may be welded provided there are not more than three consecutive cracked ligaments nor more than a total of six cracked ligaments in any one girth joint.</P>
              <P>(c) Cracks in staybolted plates may be welded provided they are located entirely within staybolted areas and the total length of any crack or series of consecutive cracks does not exceed two staybolt pitches.</P>
              <P>(d) Cracks in plain, circular or Adamson ring or similar type furnaces may be welded provided any one crack does not exceed 12 inches in length and after completion the weld is stress-relieved. Cracks in corrugated furnaces may be repaired by welding provided any one crack does not exceed 20 inches in length.</P>
              <P>(e) Fire cracks may be welded at riveted door openings extending from the edge of the plate, but not more than 2 inches beyond the centerline of the rivet holes.</P>
              <P>(f) Cracks may be welded between tube holes in the shell of water tube boiler drums, provided there are not more than two cracks in any one row in any direction, nor more than a total of four cracks in a drum, and further provided the welding meets the requirements of this subchapter for Class I welded pressure vessels and is approved by the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(g) Cracks that occur in superheater manifolds, water wallheaders, water drums, sectional headers, and other appurtenances including steam manifolds of water tube boilers may be repaired in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section if the repair is approved.</P>
              <P>(h) All cracks permitted to be repaired under this subpart shall be excavated to sound metal by grinding, flame or arc gouging or chipping out the defective metal to form a clean welding groove. The first two methods of excavation are preferable. Either a V groove or U groove wherein complete penetration of the weld metal is secured may be used. After excavation is completed and prior to welding, the excavated area shall be examined by magnetic particle, dye penetrant, or other acceptable test method. When the reverse side of the weld is accessible the root of the weld shall be chipped or ground out to insure a clean surface of the originally deposited metal and the resultant groove welded to obtain a sound weld having complete penetration. When the weld cannot be back chipped because the reverse side is inaccessible, a backing strip or other approved means of assuring full penetration shall be employed.</P>
              <P>(i) During welding of cracks a preheat shall be maintained by controlled temperatures. The degree of preheat shall be determined by the rules listed in accordance with the materials P-number groupings of PW-38, section I, appendix R, section VIII and Table Q. 11.1, section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (all incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 59.01-2). For thicknesses exceeding three-fourths inch, suitable U grooves should be employed. A welding sequence shall be used so as to equalize welding stresses.</P>
              <P>(j) Postweld heat treatment of repaired cracks shall be performed in accordance with the rules specified in PW-39, section I and UW-40, section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code for boilers and pressure vessels respectively.</P>

              <P>(1) The thickness of the original metal to be built up between the rivet holes and the calking edge shall not be less than one-fourth of the diameter of the rivet hole, and the portion of the calking edge to be thus reinforced shall not exceed 30 inches in length in a circumferential direction.</P>
              <P>(2) In all repairs to circumferential seams by welding, the rivets shall be removed over the portions to be welded for a distance of at least 6 inches beyond the repaired portion.</P>
              <P>(3) After repairs are made the rivet holes shall be reamed before the rivets are redriven.</P>
              <P>(b) It is not permissible to build up or reinforce a grooved or corroded area of unstayed internal surfaces by means of welding, except that widely scattered pit holes may be built up by welding.</P>
              <P>(c) Where external corrosion has reduced the thickness of flat plates around hand holes to an extent of not more than 40 percent of the original thickness and for a distance not exceeding 2 inches from the edge of the hole, the plate may be built up by welding.</P>
              <P>(d) Where stayed sheets have corroded to a depth not exceeding 40 percent of their original thickness, they may be reinforced or built up by welding. Where the staybolts are fitted with riveted heads, the staybolts in the reinforced area shall be renewed in accordance with the provisions of § 52.20-15 of this subchapter, but where the staybolts are fitted with nuts, the nuts may be removed and after reinforcing has been applied, collars may be welded around the staybolts in lieu of the nuts. Such reinforced areas shall not exceed 400 square inches nor more than 30 inches in one direction. Two such areas in any one plate may be reinforced: Provided, that the distance between the reinforced surfaces is not less than 30 inches.</P>
              <P>(e) When the corroded portion of a staybolted surface exceeds 400 square inches, it is permissible to make repairs by cutting out the defective portion and replacing it with a new plate, the edges of the new plate to be welded in position. In such cases, new staybolts shall be fitted in accordance with the requirements of § 52.20-15 of this subchapter and where welding is performed through a line of staybolts, welded collars as required by Figure 52.01-3 of this subchapter shall be used to attach the staybolts.</P>
              <P>(f) Eroded seams of welded pressure vessels may be repaired by rewelding the wasted portion. The wasted section of the seam shall be excavated sufficiently by grinding, flame or arc gouging or chipping to ensure proper weld penetration. Rewelded seams shall be nondestructively tested in accordance with section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 59.01-2).</P>

              <P>(a) Where corrugated or plain furnaces or flues are distorted by 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches or more, they shall be repaired by either of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(1) The furnace shall be forced back to a true circular shape, and the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, may require strongbacks or other acceptable means of support to hold the furnace from future collapse, if in his opinion such support is necessary; or,</P>
              <P>(2) The furnace shall be adequately stayed as found necessary in the judgment of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.</P>
              <P>(b) Distortion means the difference between any single measured diameter of the furnace and the diameter of a true circle at the same location. The diameter of the true circle may be taken as the original furnace diameter or may be determined by a means acceptable to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.</P>

              <P>(c) Where the distortion does not exceed 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches it will not be necessary to force the furnace back to a true circle if the allowable pressure is reduced in the ratio of 1<FR>1/2</FR> percent for each one-tenth of an inch of distortion. However, <PRTPAGE P="289"/>if the maximum distortion does not exceed 1 inch and the length of the distorted area is not more than three corrugations, or, if the maximum distortion does not exceed three-fourths inch for a length greater than three corrugations of distorted area, the repairs or reduction in pressure will not be required unless considered necessary by the marine inspector.</P>
              <P>(d) When it becomes necessary to rivet a patch to a furnace or other part of the heating surface, the riveted patch shall be placed on the waterside of the plate in order not to form a pocket in which sediment may collect.</P>
              <P>(e) Furnace crowns which have become distorted, not in excess of the limitations provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may be repaired by pumping back the distorted section to as nearly a true circle as possible and reinforcing the same by means of a ring, arc- or gas-welded to the distorted corrugation as shown in Figure 59.15-1, the welding to be done by welders and welding processors qualified in accordance with part 57 of this subchapter using acceptable welding electrodes in accordance with § 57.02-4 of this subchapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Boilers in service.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each boiler, including superheater, reheater, economizer, auxiliary boiler, low-pressure heating boiler, and unfired steam boiler, must be available for examination by the marine inspector at intervals specified by Table 61.05-10, and more often if necessary, to determine that the complete unit is in a safe and satisfactory condition. When a hydrostatic test is required, the marine inspector may examine all accessible parts of the boiler while it is under pressure.</P>
              <P>(b) The owner, master, or person in charge of the vessel shall give ample notice to the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, so that a marine inspector may witness the tests and make the required inspections.</P>

              <P>(c) Firetube boilers which cannot be entered or which cannot be satisfactorily examined internally, all boilers of lap seam construction and all boilers to which extensive repairs have been <PRTPAGE P="292"/>made or the strength of which the marine inspector has any reason to question, shall be subjected to a hydrostatic test of 1<FR>1/2</FR> times the maximum allowable working pressure. All other boilers shall be subjected to a hydrostatic test of 1<FR>1/4</FR> times the maximum allowable working pressure.</P>
              <P>(d) In applying hydrostatic pressure to boilers, arrangements shall be made to prevent main and auxiliary stop valves from being simultaneously subjected to the hydrostatic pressure on one side and steam pressure on the other side.</P>
              <P>(e) If the marine inspector has reason to believe that the boiler has deteriorated to any appreciable extent under the bottom where it rests on saddles or foundations, he shall cause the boiler to be lifted to such position that it can be thoroughly examined, provided the examination cannot be made otherwise.</P>
              <P>(f) The marine inspector may require any boiler to be drilled or gaged to determine actual thickness any time its safety is in doubt. At the first inspection for certification after a firetube or flue boiler has been installed for 10 years, it shall be gaged to determine the extent of deterioration. Thickness will be measured at or near the waterline, at the bottom and at such other places deemed necessary by the marine inspector. Examination may be by drilling or a nondestructive means acceptable to the marine inspector. Prior to the use of a nondestructive method of examination, the user shall demonstrate to the marine inspector that results having an accuracy within plus or minus 5 percent are consistently obtainable when using specimens similar to those to be examined on the boiler.</P>
              <P>(g) If the thickness is found to be less than the original thickness upon which the maximum allowable working pressure was based, it shall be recalculated. The thickness of the thinnest measured portion shall be used in this calculation. Either the design formulas given in this subchapter or the ones in effect when the boiler was contracted for or built may normally be used in this recalculation. In no case will an increase in the pressure allowed be made.</P>

              <P>(a) The stock or equity interest requirements for citizenship under this subpart encompass: title to all classes of stock; title to voting stock; and ownership of equity. An otherwise qualifying corporation or partnership may fail to meet stock or equity interest requirements because: Stock is subject to trust or fiduciary obligations in favor of non-citizens; non-citizens exercise, directly or indirectly, voting power; or non-citizens, by any means, exercise control over the entity. The applicable stock or equity interest requirement is not met if the amount of stock subject to obligations in favor of non-citizens, non-citizen voting power, or non-citizen control exceeds the percentage of the non-citizen interest permitted.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purpose of stock or equity interest requirements for citizenship under this subpart, control of non-fishing industry vessels includes an absolute right to: Direct corporate or partnership business; limit the actions of or replace the chief executive officer, a majority of the board of directors, or any general partner; direct the transfer or operations of any vessel owned by the corporation or partnership; or otherwise exercise authority over the business of the corporation or partnership. Control does not include the right to simply participate in these activities or the right to receive a financial return, e.g., interest or the equivalent of interest on a loan or other financing obligations.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purpose of this section, control of a fishing industry vessel means having:</P>
              <P>(1) The right to direct the business of the entity that owns the vessel;</P>
              <P>(2) The right to limit the actions of or to replace the chief executive officer, the majority of the board of directors, any general partner, or any person serving in a management capacity of the entity that owns the vessel;</P>
              <P>(3) The right to direct the transfer, the operation, or the manning of a vessel with a fishery endorsement.</P>

              <P>(d) For purposes of meeting the stock or equity interest requirements for citizenship under this subpart where title to a vessel is held by an entity <PRTPAGE P="339"/>comprised, in whole or in part, of other entities which are not individuals, each entity contributing to the stock or equity interest qualifications of the entity holding title must be a citizen eligible to document vessels in its own right with the trade endorsement sought.</P>

              <P>(3) A vessel is not considered rebuilt when work performed on its hull or superstructure constitutes 7.5 percent or less of the vessel's steelweight prior to the work.</P>
              <P>(c) For a vessel of which the hull and superstructure is constructed of material other than steel or aluminum—</P>
              <P>(1) A vessel is deemed rebuilt when work performed on its hull or superstructure constitutes a quantum of work determined, to the maximum extent practicable, to be comparable to more than 10 percent of the vessel's steelweight prior to the work, calculated as if the vessel were wholly constructed of steel or aluminum.</P>
              <P>(2) A vessel may be considered rebuilt when work performed on its hull or superstructure constitutes a quantum of work determined, to the maximum extent practicable, to be comparable to more than 7.5 percent but not more than 10 percent of the vessel's steelweight prior to the work, calculated as if the vessel were wholly constructed of steel or aluminum.</P>

              <P>(1) A written statement applying for a rebuilt determination, outlining in detail the work performed and naming the place(s) where the work was performed;</P>
              <P>(2) Calculations showing the actual or comparable steelweight of the work performed on the vessel, the actual or comparable steelweight of the vessel, and comparing the actual or comparable steelweight of the work performed to the actual or comparable steelweight of the vessel;</P>
              <P>(3) Accurate sketches or blueprints describing the work performed; and</P>
              <P>(4) Any further submissions requested by the National Vessel Documentation Center.</P>

              <P>(f) Regardless of the extent of actual work performed, the owner of a vessel currently entitled to coastwise or fisheries endorsements may, as an alternative to filing the items listed in paragraph (e) of this section, submit a <PRTPAGE P="355"/>written statement to the National Vessel Documentation Center declaring the vessel rebuilt outside the United States. The vessel will then be deemed to have been rebuilt outside the United States with loss of trading privileges.</P>

              <P>(a) If you are an owner or mortgagee of a fishing vessel less than 100 feet in length and believe that there is a conflict between 46 CFR part 67 and any international treaty or agreement to which the United States is a party on October 1, 2001, and to which the United States is currently a party, you may petition the National Vessel Documentation Center (NVDC) for a ruling that all or sections of part 67 do not apply to you with respect to a particular vessel, provided that you had an ownership interest in the vessel or a mortgage on the vessel on October 1, 2001. You may file your petition with the NVDC before October 1, 2001, with respect to international treaties or agreements in effect at the time of your petition which are not scheduled to expire before October 1, 2001.</P>
              <P>(b) If you are filing a petition for exemption with the NVDC for reasons stated in paragraph (a) of this section, your petition must include:</P>
              <P>(1) Evidence of the ownership structure of the vessel petitioning for an exemption as of October 1, 2001, and any subsequent changes to the ownership structure of the vessel;</P>
              <P>(i) If you are filing your petition before October 1, 2001, you may substitute evidence of the ownership structure as it exists on the date you file your petition;</P>
              <P>(2) A copy of the provisions of the international agreement or treaty that you believe is in conflict with this part;</P>
              <P>(3) A detailed description of how the provisions of the international agreement or treaty conflict with this part;</P>
              <P>(4) For all petitions filed before October 1, 2001, a certification that the owner intends to transfer no ownership interest in the vessel to a non-U.S. citizen for the following year.</P>
              <P>(5) For all petitions filed after October 1, 2001, a certification that no ownership interest was transferred to a non-U.S. citizen after September 30, 2001.</P>

              <P>(c) You must file a separate petition for each vessel requiring an exemption unless the NVDC authorizes consolidated filing. Petitions should include two copies of all required materials and <PRTPAGE P="364"/>should be sent to the following address: National Vessel Documentation Center, 792 TJ Jackson Drive, Falling Water, West Virginia, 25419.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon receipt of a complete petition, the NVDC will review the petition to determine whether the effective international treaty or agreement and the requirements of this part are in conflict. If the NVDC determines that this part conflicts with the effective international treaty or agreement, then the NVDC will inform you of the guidelines and requirements you must meet and maintain to qualify for a fisheries endorsement.</P>
              <P>(e) If the vessel is determined through the petition process to be exempt from all or sections of the requirements of this part, then you must annually, from the date of exemption, submit the following evidence of its ownership structure to the NVDC:</P>
              <P>(1) The vessel's current ownership structure;</P>
              <P>(2) The identity of all non-citizen owners and the percentages of their ownership interest in the vessel;</P>
              <P>(3) Any changes in the ownership structure that have occurred since you last submitted evidence of the vessel's ownership structure to the NVDC; and</P>
              <P>(4) A statement ensuring that no interest in the vessel was transferred to a non-citizen during the previous year.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Defined.</E> “Under-deck tonnage” means the tonnage of the space below the line of the tonnage deck, as that volume is calculated under this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Method of calculating tonnage.</E> Under-deck tonnage is calculated by applying Simpson's first rule using the tonnage length and the areas of the transverse sections prescribed by this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Identifying the tonnage deck.</E> In vessels with two or less enumerated decks, the tonnage deck is the uppermost complete deck. In vessels with more than two enumerated decks, the tonnage deck is the second enumerated deck from the keel as determined in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Enumerating the decks to identify the second deck from the keel.</E> The uppermost complete deck is an enumerated deck. Decks below the uppermost complete deck that extend from stem to stern and side to side at all points along their lengths are also enumerated, provided they are not disqualified by either of the following deck discontinuities:</P>
              <P>(1) A through-deck opening that is not fitted with a cover (or equivalent) and whose area is more than 10 percent of the total deck area, as viewed from above.</P>
              <P>(2) A deck recess that is not through-hull for which the depth at its deepest point is more than five feet below adjacent portions of the deck and whose area as viewed from above is more than 10 percent of the total deck area from stem to stern, as viewed from above.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Identifying the line of the tonnage deck.</E> (1) If the tonnage deck runs in a continuous line from stem to stern, the line of the tonnage deck is the longitudinal line at the underside of the tonnage deck.</P>
              <P>(2) If the tonnage deck is stepped, the line of the tonnage deck is the longitudinal line of the underside of the lowest portion of that deck parallel with the upper portions of that deck. Steps that do not extend from side to side or are less than three feet in length are ignored when establishing the line of the tonnage deck. (See § 69.123, figures 1 and 2.) Spaces between the line of the tonnage deck and the higher portions of that deck are not included in under-deck tonnage.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Tonnage length.</E> (1) “Tonnage length” means the length of a horizontal straight line measured at the centerline of the vessel from the point forward where the line of the tonnage deck intersects the line of the inboard faces of the ordinary side frames to the point aft where the line of the tonnage deck intersects the inboard face of the ordinary transom frames or cant frames. (See § 69.123, figure 3.)</P>

              <P>(2) For a vessel having a headblock or square end with framing which extends from the tonnage deck to the bottom of the vessel, the tonnage length terminates on the inboard face of the <PRTPAGE P="403"/>headblock or ordinary end frames. (See § 69.123, figure 4.)</P>
              <P>(3) For a vessel having a square bow or stern and tonnage deck with camber, the effect of the camber on the tonnage length must be considered. The tonnage length must be measured below the tonnage deck at a distance equal to one-third of round camber and one-half of straight pitch camber.</P>
              <P>(4) The forward and after termini of the tonnage length must be a distance of no more than eight and one-half feet from the associated inboard surface of the skin of the hull at the bow and stern as measured at the centerline of the vessel, and the after terminus must not be forward of the centerline of the rudderstock.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Division of vessel into transverse sections.</E> (1) Except as under paragraph (m)(1)(iii) of this section, the tonnage length is divided into an even number of equal parts as indicated in the following table:</P>

              <P>(2) Transverse sections are cut at each end of the tonnage length and at each point of division of the tonnage length, whose location is referred to as a tonnage station, and assigned sequential tonnage station numbers, beginning at the stem. Intervals and one-third intervals between the points of division are measured to the nearest thousandth of a foot. (See § 69.123 figures 5 and 6.)</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Depths of transverse sections.</E> (1) Transverse section depths are measured at each point of division of the tonnage length at the centerline of the vessel from a point below the line of the tonnage deck equal to one-third of the camber or to one-half of the pitch of the beam down to the upper side of the ordinary frames, floors, longitudinals, or tank top of a double bottom for water ballast, as the case may be.</P>
              <P>(2) When a depth falls at a point where the tank top of a double bottom for water ballast has a straight fall from centerline to the wings, the depth terminates at one-half of the height of fall. (See § 69.123 figure 8.)</P>
              <P>(3) When a depth falls at a point where the tank top of a double bottom for water ballast rises from the centerline to the wings, the depth terminates at one-half the dead rise. (See § 69.123, figure 9.)</P>
              <P>(4) The depth at the midpoint of the tonnage length or, when a vessel is measured in parts, the depth at the midpoint of each part determines the number of equal parts into which each depth is divided, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If the midpoint depth is 16 feet or less, each depth is divided into four equal parts. If the midpoint depth exceeds 16 feet, each depth is divided into six equal parts. (See § 69.123, figure 7.)</P>
              <P>(ii) The interval between the points of division of a depth and one-third intervals are carried to the nearest hundredth of a foot.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Breadths of transverse sections.</E> (1) Transverse section breadths are measured horizontally at each point of division of each depth and also at the upper and lower points of each depth. Breadths are measured to the inboard face of the ordinary frames or to the line of the ordinary frames. Breadths are measured parallel to each other and at right angle to the vessel's centerline. (See § 69.123, figure 7.)</P>
              <P>(2) Upper breadths are not reduced by measuring to deck-beam brackets. In cases of camber when an upper breadth passes through the deck (see § 69.123, figure 7), the breadth is measured to the line of the side frames at the under side of the deck projected vertically up to the height of the upper breadth.</P>

              <P>(3) Bottom breadths are measured only as far as the flat of the floor extends. (See § 69.123, figures 7 and 10.) When bottom frames rise immediately from the flat keel, bottom breadths are equal to the breadth of the flat keel. Where there is no double bottom for water ballast and where there is dead rise of the bottom out to the sides of the vessel, bottom breadths are equal to the part of the bottom plating not affected by dead rise.<PRTPAGE P="404"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Bottom breadths falling in way of a double bottom, the top of which rises or falls from centerline to the wings, are measured between the inboard faces of the frame brackets which connect the double bottom with the frames. (See § 69.123, figures 8 and 9.)</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Measuring spaces having ceiling.</E> The maximum allowance for terminating measurements on ceiling is three inches on the bottom frames or tank top and three inches on each side frame. When ceiling is less than three inches thick, only the actual thickness is allowed. When ceiling is fitted on a platform directly above the bottom frames, depths are measured down through the platform to the upper side of the frames and the allowable ceiling on the platform is then deducted.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Area of transverse sections.</E> (1) A transverse section at an end of the tonnage length may not yield area, except in vessels (such as barges) with an upright bow or stern.</P>
              <P>(2) The breadths of each transverse section are numbered from above, the upper being “1”, the second down being “2”, and so on to the lowest.</P>
              <P>(3) Multiply the even numbered breadths by four and the odd numbered breadths by two, except for the first and last breadths, which are multiplied by one.</P>
              <P>(4) Add together the products from paragraph (k)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Multiply the sum from paragraph (k)(4) of this section by one-third of the interval between the breadths. The product is the area of the transverse section.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Tonnage.</E> (1) Number the transverse sections successively “1”, “2”, and so forth, beginning at the bow.</P>
              <P>(2) Multiply the area of the even numbered sections by four and the area of the odd numbered sections by two, except the first and last sections, which are multiplied by one.</P>
              <P>(3) Add together the products from paragraph (l)(2) of this section and multiply the sum by one-third of the interval between the sections. The product is the volume under-deck.</P>
              <P>(4) The volume under-deck is divided by 100 and is, subject to exemptions, the under-deck tonnage.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Steps in double bottom for water ballast.</E> (1) The tonnage length of a vessel having a step exceeding six inches in height in its double bottom for water ballast is divided into longitudinal parts at the step. Each part is subdivided as follows to determine the number of transverse sections:</P>
              <P>(i) Parts 20 feet or under in length are divided into two equal parts.</P>
              <P>(ii) Parts over 20 feet and under 40 feet in length are divided into four equal parts.</P>
              <P>(iii) Parts 40 feet or over are divided as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The tonnage of each part is calculated separately. The sum of the tonnages of the parts is the under-deck tonnage.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Spaces open to the sea.</E> In calculating the tonnage of spaces below the uppermost complete deck, subtract from each breadth measurement the portion of that measurement that spans a space, or a portion thereof, that is open to the sea.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Open vessels.</E> (1) An open vessel is a vessel without an uppermost complete deck.</P>
              <P>(2) The line of the tonnage deck for an open vessel is the upper edge of the upper strake. Depths of transverse sections are taken from this line.</P>
              <P>(3) Any vessel, other than one having a mechanically refrigerated hold, that is not an open vessel and that has a tonnage length of less than 50 feet is measured as an open vessel, if the distance between the line of its tonnage deck and the upper edge of the upper strake is more than one-sixth of the midship depth. “Midship depth” means the depth measured from the line of the upper edge of the upper strake to the point in the bottom used for measuring tonnage depths.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">General requirements on ordinary frames</E>—(1) <E T="03">Construction.</E> An ordinary frame must not be penetrated by an intersecting frame used to strengthen the vessel's hull, except in a vessel of wooden construction. Ordinary frames must be of the same material, or have the same material properties, as the adjacent hull, and attach to the adjacent hull to at least the same extent as adjacent ordinary and normal frames. If comprised of different elements, the elements must be joined to each other to the same extent that the frame is <PRTPAGE P="405"/>joined to the hull. The frame, or portions thereof, not meeting these requirements must be treated as if not there when establishing the line of the ordinary frames.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Frame spacing and extension.</E> Ordinary frames used to establish the line of the ordinary frames must be spaced on centers that are a maximum of four feet apart. These frames must extend for a length of at least one tonnage interval that begins at, ends at, or crosses the associated tonnage station. For a longitudinally-framed vessel, the frames must begin and end at a transverse ordinary frame or at the vessel's hull.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Different sized framing.</E> When an ordinary frame has a different depth of frame than an adjacent ordinary frame, the line of the ordinary frames is established using the set of alternating frames that yields the smallest sectional area at the associated tonnage station, with the sectional area based on the frame with the smallest depth of frame in the chosen alternating set.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Frame openings.</E> If an opening in an ordinary frame is oversized, or is penetrated by a frame other than an ordinary frame, the line of the ordinary frames is established as if the frame material above and inboard of the opening is not there. Similarly, frame material separating adjacent openings that are within the longest linear dimension of either opening must be treated as if not there when establishing the line of the ordinary frames. An opening is oversized if the opening is:</P>
              <P>(i) Circular in shape with a diameter exceeding 18 inches;</P>

              <P>(ii) Oval in shape of a size greater than 15 × 23 inches (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> either the minor axis exceeds 15 inches or the major axis exceeds 23 inches, and the oval's area exceeds 255 square inches (345 square inches in a fuel tank)); or</P>
              <P>(iii) Any shape other than circular or oval, whose area exceeds 255 square inches (345 square inches in a fuel tank).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Asymmetrical framing.</E> Where ordinary frames are configured such that the line of the ordinary frames would be asymmetrical about the centerline of the vessel, breadth measurements are determined by taking half-breadths on the side of the vessel that yields the greatest sectional area at the associated tonnage station, and multiplying those half-breadths by a factor of two to yield the full breadths.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Spaces exempt from inclusion in tonnage.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This section lists spaces which are exempt from inclusion in tonnage.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Spaces on or above the line of the uppermost complete deck.</E> The following spaces or portions of spaces on or above the line of the uppermost complete deck are exempt if the spaces or portions are reasonable in extent and adapted and used exclusively for the purpose indicated:</P>
              <P>(1) Spaces for anchor gear, including capstan, windlass, and chain locker, are exempt.</P>
              <P>(2) Companions and booby-hatches protecting stairways or ladderways leading to spaces below are exempt, whether or not the spaces below are exempt.</P>
              <P>(3) Galley or other spaces fitted with a range or oven for cooking food to be consumed on board the vessel are exempt.</P>
              <P>(4) Spaces designed to provide light or air to propelling machinery are exempt, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) When propelling machinery is located entirely on or above the line of the uppermost complete deck, the entire propelling machinery space and all fuel bunker spaces that are also located above that line are exempt as light or air spaces. (See exception in § 69.121(d)(1) for framed-in spaces.)</P>
              <P>(ii) When part of the propelling machinery projects above the line of the uppermost complete deck into a space used exclusively to provide light or air to the propelling machinery, the entire space is exempt as light or air space. When any portion of this space is used for purposes other than providing light or air, only the portion of the space used for light or air, the space occupied by the propelling machinery itself, and a propelling machinery working space allowance under § 69.121 limited to two feet, if available, on each side of the propelling machinery are exempt.</P>
              <P>(iii) Any part of an escape shaft, or a companion sheltering an escape shaft, above the line of the uppermost complete deck is exempt as light or air space.</P>
              <P>(iv) Space that would otherwise be exempt as a light or air space is not exempt when propelling machinery is boxed-in and does not extend above the line of the uppermost complete deck. Any portion of the boxed-in space above the line of the uppermost complete deck is exempt.</P>
              <P>(5) Skylights affording light or air to a space below, other than to propelling machinery spaces. Space immediately below the line of the deck on which a skylight is located is exempt only when there is an opening in the next lower deck directly below the skylight to permit light or air to an even lower deck.</P>
              <P>(6) Machinery spaces, other than for propelling machinery under § 169.121.</P>
              <P>(7) Spaces for steering gear.</P>
              <P>(8) Water closet spaces that are fitted with at least a toilet and are intended for use by more than one person.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Passenger spaces.</E> (1) As used in this section, the term “passenger” includes officers and enlisted men on military vessels who are not assigned ship's duties and not entered on the ship's articles.</P>
              <P>(2) As used in this section, “passenger space” means a space reserved exclusively for the use of passengers and includes, but is not limited to, berthing areas, staterooms, bathrooms, toilets, libraries, writing rooms, lounges, dining rooms, saloons, smoking rooms, and recreational rooms. The space need not be part of or adjacent to a berthing area to be considered a passenger space. Spaces used by both passengers and crew members (e.g., first aid stations), or used for passenger support but not accessible to passengers at all times (e.g., vaults on a gaming vessel) cannot be exempted as passenger space.</P>

              <P>(3) A passenger space located on, or above the first deck above the uppermost complete deck is exempt from tonnage. To qualify as the first deck above the uppermost complete deck, the deck must be at least six inches <PRTPAGE P="408"/>above the uppermost complete deck at all points along its length.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Open structures.</E>(1) Structures that are located on or above the line of the uppermost complete deck that are under cover (sheltered), but open to the weather are exempt from tonnage as open space. The following additional requirements apply:</P>
              <P>(i) If a structure is divided into compartments, only those compartments which are open to the weather are exempt from tonnage under the provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Open space cannot progress vertically through openings in a deck within the structure.</P>
              <P>(iii) A space that is outside a structure's boundary bulkhead as defined in § 69.53 is considered open to the weather provided the space is eligible to be treated as an excluded space under the provisions of § 69.61, regardless of whether or not the space is fitted with means designed for securing cargo or stores.</P>
              <P>(2) A structure is considered open to the weather when an exterior end bulkhead of the structure is open and, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4), (5), and (6) of this section, is not fitted with any means of closing. To be considered open to the weather, the end bulkhead must not have a coaming height of more than two feet in way of any required opening nor any permanent obstruction within two and one-half feet of the opening, it must be fitted with a deck or platform that is a minimum of two and one-half feet wide on the exterior side of the opening, and it must have one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Two openings, each at least three feet wide and at least four feet high in the clear, one on each side of the centerline of the structure. If the openings lead to two separate interior compartments, there must be circulation of open space between the two compartments via a single such opening, or series of such openings, in the intermediate bulkhead(s).</P>
              <P>(ii) One opening at least four feet wide and at least five feet high in the clear.</P>
              <P>(iii) One opening at least 20 square feet in the clear with a breadth in excess of four feet and a height of not less than three feet.</P>
              <P>(3) A compartment within an open structure is considered open to the weather only when an interior bulkhead of that compartment has an opening or openings that meet the requirements for end bulkheads under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (iii) of this section. Other compartments within the structure are not considered open to the weather. The following additional requirements apply:</P>
              <P>(i) For the interior compartment to be considered open to the weather, any compartment or series of compartments from which the open space progresses must have an opening or openings meeting the requirements for end bulkhead openings, except that the opening(s) need not be located in the forward or after end of the compartment.</P>
              <P>(ii) Open space may not progress from a space that is open under the provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section unless the space may also be considered open under another provision of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) An interior or exterior opening that is temporarily closed by shifting boards dropped into channel sections at the sides of the opening is considered open to the weather if battening, caulking, or gaskets of any material are not used.</P>
              <P>(5) An interior or exterior opening that is temporarily closed by cover plates or boards held in place only by hook bolts (see § 69.123, Figure 12) is considered open to the weather—</P>

              <P>(6) An interior or exterior opening that is temporarily closed by cover plates or boards held in place only by bolts and crosspieces is considered open to the weather—</P>
              <P>(i) If the bolts are not installed through the bulkhead;</P>

              <P>(ii) If the bolts and crosspieces are not held in place by cleats or other attachments to or through the bulkhead;<PRTPAGE P="409"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) If the cover plates or boards fit tightly against the weather side of the bulkhead; and</P>

              <P>(7) Notwithstanding the opening size requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a structure with its aft end entirely open from the under side of its overhead stiffeners down to the deck, to the line of the deck, or to a coaming not exceeding three inches in height and open athwartship between the inboard faces of the side stiffeners is considered open to the weather. The opening may be covered by a wire mesh screen or temporarily closed by canvas secured at the top and lashed or buttoned in place.</P>
              <P>(8) A structure is considered open to the weather if:</P>
              <P>(i) Both sides of the structure are open and not fitted with any means of closing other than temporary covers meeting the requirements of paragraphs (d)(4), (5), and (6) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) The openings are directly across from each other, are not separated by a bulkhead or bulkheads, and do not have any permanent obstruction within two and one-half feet of either opening; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The openings have a continuous height of at least three feet, or the full height of the structure, whichever is less, and either extend the full length of the structure or each have an area of 60 square feet.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Open space between the shelter deck and the uppermost complete deck.</E> (1) Space that is between the shelter deck and the uppermost complete deck and that is under cover (sheltered) but open to the weather is exempt from tonnage when all openings in the uppermost complete deck are provided with a watertight means of closing.</P>
              <P>(2) A space is considered “open to the weather” under paragraph (e)(1) of this section when the shelter deck above the space has a middle line opening which conforms to the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The middle line opening must be at least four feet long in the clear and at least as wide as the after cargo hatch on the shelter deck, but not less than one-half the width of the vessel at the midpoint of the length of the opening. The opening may have rounded corners not exceeding a nine inch radius. When a greater radius is required by the Coast Guard or a Coast Guard recognized classification society under § 42.05-60 of this chapter, notification of that requirement must be submitted to the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(ii) The middle line opening must be located so that the distance between the aft edge of the middle line opening and the vessel's stern is not less than one-twentieth of the tonnage length of the vessel and the distance between the fore edge of the opening and the vessel's stem is not less than one-fifth of the tonnage length of the vessel.</P>
              <P>(iii) The middle line opening must not be within a structure of any type.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the middle line opening is guarded by rails or stanchions, the rails and stanchions must not be used to secure or assist in securing a cover over the opening.</P>
              <P>(v) The coaming of the middle line opening must not exceed one foot mean height above the shelter deck. Bolts must not pass through the stiffeners or flanges on the coaming, nor may there be any other attachments on the coaming for fastening a cover. Portable wood covers may be fitted over the middle line opening if held in place only by lashings fitted to the under side of the covers. Metal covers may be fitted if held in place only by hook bolts spaced not less than 18 inches apart that pass through the cover and hook over angle stiffeners or flanges fitted to the outside of the coaming. Battening, caulking, seals, or gaskets of any material may not be used in association with any middle line opening cover.</P>
              <P>(vi) The space below the middle line opening must have a minimum length of four feet throughout its entire breadth and height and be in the clear at all times.</P>
              <P>(vii) A scupper having a five inch minimum inside diameter and fitted with a screw down non-return valve geared to and operated from the shelter deck must be fitted on each side of the upper deck in way of the middle line opening.</P>

              <P>(3) When the shelter deck space forward or aft of the middle line opening is divided by interior bulkheads, only those compartments with at least two <PRTPAGE P="410"/>openings that progress to the middle line opening are considered “open to the weather” under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Each required opening must be at least three feet wide and at least four feet high in the clear, must not have a coaming height of more than two feet, and must not be fitted (except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4), (d)(5), and (d)(6) of this section) with any means of closing. Other compartments within the shelter deck space are not considered “open to the weather” under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Water ballast spaces.</E> A space, regardless of location, adapted only for water ballast and not available for stores, supplies, fuel, or cargo (other than water to be used for underwater drilling, mining, and related purposes, including production), upon request, may be exempt from tonnage if the following are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The space must be available at all times only for water ballast that is piped through a system independent of other systems (except fire fighting and bilge suction systems). Pumps, pipes, and other equipment for loading and unloading water ballast must be of a size suitable for the efficient handling of the water ballast within a reasonable time frame. All manholes providing access to a water ballast space must be oval or circular and not greater than 34 inches in diameter. Except for those on a deck exposed to the weather, the manholes may have a coaming not exceeding six inches in height. Existing hatches over spaces being converted to water ballast spaces must have a watertight cover plate welded to the hatch and a manhole, as described in this paragraph, fitted in the plating.</P>
              <P>(2) The primary purpose of the water ballast must be to afford a means of maintaining the vessel's stability, immersion, trim, pre-loading conditions, or seakeeping capabilities.</P>
              <P>(3) If the space is in a vessel that is subject to inspection under 46 U.S.C. 3301, the space must be considered when determining the adequacy of the vessel's stability under 46 CFR chapter I.</P>
              <P>(4) If the total of all water ballast spaces to be exempted from tonnage exceeds 30 percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage (as calculated under this subpart without any allowance for water ballast), a justification of the operating conditions that require the water ballast must be submitted to the measuring organization for approval. Although a single condition may justify all water ballast spaces, several conditions may be necessary in other cases. However, a particular tank is not justified by a condition if another tank already justified by another condition could be used as effectively. The justification must—</P>
              <P>(i) Designate the vessel's service;</P>
              <P>(ii) Explain for what purpose under paragraph (f)(2) of this section the water ballast is being used;</P>
              <P>(iii) Include the capacity, tank arrangement, and piping plans for the vessel;</P>
              <P>(iv) Include a statement certifying that the space will be used exclusively for water ballast as prescribed by this section;</P>
              <P>(v) If water ballast is used for stability, describe each loading condition and the resultant metacentric height (GM) and include calculations;</P>
              <P>(vi) If water ballast is used for immersion or trim, describe those conditions and include loading and trim calculations;</P>
              <P>(vii) If water ballast is used for pre-loading, describe how it is used and include strength and weight calculations; and</P>
              <P>(viii) If water ballast is used for seakeeping, describe each loading condition, GM, period of roll, and, if speed is involved, speed versus trim and draft and include calculations.</P>
              <P>(5) If the water ballast space or its use, purpose, or piping are changed, the vessel owner or operator must report the change promptly to a measurement organization listed in § 69.15 for a determination as to whether a tonnage remeasurement is required.Changes in vessel service must also be reported if a water ballast justification was required to be submitted for the vessel.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Methods for measuring exempt spaces.</E> (1) If the exempt space is located within the superstructure, the exempt space is measured using the same procedures used to measure superstructure tonnage under § 69.113.<PRTPAGE P="411"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If the exempt space is located between-deck, the space is measured using the same procedures used for between-deck tonnage under § 69.111(c), except that the length of the exempt space is divided into the even number of spaces most equal to the number of spaces into which the between-deck was divided.</P>
              <P>(3) If the exempt space is located under-deck, the space is measured using the same procedures used for under-deck tonnage under § 69.109, except that the length of the exempt space is divided into the even number of spaces most equal to the number of spaces into which the under-deck was divided, and the zone of influence method must be applied if the ordinary frames upon which the under-deck breadth measurements are based do not have the same depth of frame.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Engine room deduction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The engine room deduction is either a percentage of the vessel's total propelling machinery spaces or a percentage of the vessel's gross register tonnage.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Propelling machinery spaces.</E> (1) Propelling machinery spaces are the spaces occupied by the main propelling machinery and auxiliary machinery and spaces reasonably necessary for the operation and maintenance of the machinery. Propelling machinery spaces do not include spaces for fuel tanks, spaces exempt from tonnage under § 69.117, and spaces not used or not available for use in connection with the propelling machinery.</P>
              <P>(2) Propelling machinery spaces are—</P>
              <P>(i) Space below the crown. The crown is the top of the main space of the engine room to which the heights of the main space are taken. The crown is either the underside of a deck or, if the side bulkheads are sloping, the uppermost point at which the slope terminates. (See § 69.123, figures 13 and 14.)</P>
              <P>(ii) Framed-in space located between the crown and the uppermost complete deck and used for propelling machinery or for the admission of light or air to propelling machinery spaces. (See § 69.123, figures 13 and 14.)</P>
              <P>(iii) Shaft tunnel space and thrust block recess space.</P>
              <P>(iv) Space below the uppermost complete deck used for escape shafts or trunked ladderways leading from the aft end of the shaft tunnel to the deck above.</P>
              <P>(v) Space containing a fuel oil transfer pump located in a separate space and not used for bunkering the vessel. When the pump serves both ballast and fuel oil, only one-half of the pump's space is considered a propelling machinery space.</P>
              <P>(vi) Spaces containing fuel oil settling tanks used solely for the main boilers. The space must not exceed one percent of the vessel's gross tonnage.</P>
              <P>(vii) Spaces for engineers' stores and workshops located below the uppermost complete deck and either open to a propelling machinery space or separated from a propelling machinery space only by a screen bulkhead. The space must not exceed three-quarters of one percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage.</P>
              <P>(viii) Framed-in space located above the line of the uppermost complete deck and used for propelling machinery or for the admission of light or air to a propelling machinery space, when requested under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ix) If the propelling machinery is boxed-in below the tonnage deck, the boxed-in space plus the spaces outside of the boxing for the shaft, auxiliary engines, and related propelling machinery. If a portion of the boxed-in space extends above a platform or partial deck that is below the uppermost complete deck, that portion is also considered part of the propelling machinery space.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Methods for measuring propelling machinery spaces.</E> (1) If the propelling machinery space is bulkheaded off or is not larger than necessary for the safe operation and maintenance of the propelling machinery, the entire space, or, if bulkheaded off, the portion bulkheaded off, is measured for the engine room deduction.</P>

              <P>(2) If the propelling machinery space is not bulkheaded off or is larger than necessary for the safe operation and maintenance of the propelling machinery, only the space occupied by the propelling machinery itself plus a working space of two feet, if available, <PRTPAGE P="414"/>on each side of the propelling machinery is measured for the engine room deduction. If the working space overlaps another working space not related to the propelling machinery, only one-half of the overlapping working space is included in the propelling machinery space. The height of the working space is measured as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If the propelling machinery is located in more than one space, each space must be measured separately.</P>
              <P>(4) If the propelling machinery is located in a space with a step in the bottom or side lines, each stepped portion of the space must be measured separately.</P>
              <P>(5) The length of a space under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is measured from the bulkhead just forward of the propelling machinery to the bulkhead just aft of the propelling machinery. The length of a space under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is measured from the forward edge of the working space to the aft edge of the working space.</P>
              <P>(6) If the boundaries of the propelling machinery space form a rectangle, the product of the length, breadth, and height, divided by 100, is the tonnage of the space.</P>
              <P>(7) If the boundaries of the propelling machinery space are continuous fair lines, heights are measured at the fore and aft ends and at the center of the space from the bottom frames, floors, or tank top of a double bottom up to the line of the crown. A breadth is measured at half-height of each height. The product of the length, mean breadth, and mean height, divided by 100, is the tonnage of the space.</P>
              <P>(8) If the propelling machinery space is in the aft end of the hull, extends from side to side of the hull, and has a continuous bottom line, the length of the space is divided into the even number of equal parts most nearly equal to the number of parts that the tonnage length under § 69.109(g) was divided. The tonnage is then calculated by the same method used for calculating the under-deck tonnage in § 69.109(l).</P>
              <P>(9) The tonnage of a framed-in space located between the crown and the uppermost complete deck and used for propelling machinery or for the admission of light or air to the propelling machinery space, is the product of its length, breadth, and height, divided by 100.</P>
              <P>(10) The tonnage of a shaft tunnel, or a thrust block recess, having a flat top is the product of its length, breadth, and height, divided by 100. If the shaft tunnel or thrust block recess top is not flat, the space above must be calculated by using the appropriate geometrical formula. If the space aft of the shaft tunnel extends from side to side of the vessel, the tonnage of the space is found by the formula for measuring peak tanks in § 69.109(l).</P>
              <P>(11) The length and breadth of the space for a shaft tunnel, or a thrust block recess, when not cased is that which is necessary for maintenance of the shaft. The height allowed for thrust block recess space must not exceed seven feet. The mean height allowed for the shaft tunnel space must not exceed six feet. In a multi-screw vessel where the shaft tunnel or thrust block recess space is open from side to side, measure only the space used for purposes of propelling the vessel.</P>
              <P>(12) When the propelling machinery is on a bed at the vessel's bottom, the height of the propelling machinery space is measured from the top of the bottom frames or floors.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Request to treat certain framed-in engine room spaces as part of a propelling machinery space.</E> (1) Under § 69.117(b)(4), framed-in spaces located above the line of the uppermost complete deck and used for propelling machinery or for admitting light or air to a propelling machinery space are exempt from inclusion in tonnage. However, upon written request to a measurement organization listed in § 69.15, the vessel owner may elect to have these spaces included in calculating the gross register tonnage, then deducted from the gross register tonnage as propelling machinery spaces under paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section when calculating the net register tonnage.</P>

              <P>(2) The framed-in space must be safe, seaworthy, and used only for propelling machinery or for the admission of light or air to the propelling machinery space. The length of the space must not exceed the length of the propelling machinery space and the breadth must <PRTPAGE P="415"/>not exceed one-half of the extreme inside midship breadth of the vessel. Portions of the framed-in space that are plated over are not included in the propelling machinery space.</P>
              <P>(3) To exercise the option in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, all of the framed-in space need not be treated as propelling machinery space, but only that portion required to entitle the vessel to have 32 percent of its gross register tonnage deducted as an engine room deduction under paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Calculating the engine room deduction.</E> (1) The engine room deduction is based on a percentage of the vessel's gross register tonnage or a percentage of the total propelling machinery space.</P>
              <P>(2) For vessels propelled in whole or in part by screw—</P>
              <P>(i) If the total propelling machinery space is 13 percent or less of the vessel's gross register tonnage, deduct <FR>32/13</FR> times the total propelling machinery space;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the total propelling machinery space is more than 13 but less than 20 percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage, deduct 32 percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage; or</P>
              <P>(iii) If the total propelling machinery space is 20 percent or more of the vessel's gross register tonnage, deduct either 32 percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage or 1.75 times the total propelling machinery space, whichever the vessel owner elects.</P>
              <P>(3) For vessels propelled in whole or in part by paddle-wheel—</P>
              <P>(i) If the total propelling machinery space is 20 percent or less of the vessel's gross register tonnage, deduct <FR>37/20</FR> times the total propelling machinery space;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the total propelling machinery space is more than 20 but less than 30 percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage, deduct 37 percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage; or</P>
              <P>(iii) If the total propelling machinery space is 30 percent or more of the vessel's gross register tonnage, deduct either 37 percent of the vessel's gross register tonnage or 1.5 times the total propelling machinery space, whichever the vessel owner elects.</P>

              <P>(a) At the option of the vessel owner, a vessel having a second deck is assigned either two gross and two net register tonnages or one gross and one net register tonnage corresponding to the lower gross and net register tonnages.</P>
              <P>(b) If two gross and two net register tonnages are assigned, the higher tonnages (i.e. those based only on exemptions under § 69.169 (a) through (d)) are applicable when the upper edge of the tonnage mark is submerged and the lower tonnages (i.e. those based only on all exemptions under § 69.169) are applicable when the upper edge of the tonnage mark is not submerged.</P>
              <P>(c) If only the low gross and low net register tonnages, as calculated under paragraph (b) of this section, are assigned, these tonnages are applicable at all times. On these vessels, a load line must be assigned at a level below the line of the second deck, and the tonnage mark must be located in accordance with § 69.177(a)(6) at the level of the uppermost part of the load line grid.</P>

              <P>(2) The tonnage mark is a horizontal line 15 inches long and one inch wide. The tonnage mark must be designated by a welded bead or other permanent mark 15 inches long placed along the top edge of the tonnage mark.</P>
              <P>(3) Above the tonnage mark is placed an inverted equilateral triangle, each side of which is 12 inches long and one inch wide, with its apex touching the upper edge of the center of the tonnage mark.</P>
              <P>(4) If the vessel has a load line mark, the longitudinal location of the center of the tonnage mark must be between 21 inches and six feet six inches aft of the vertical centerline of the load line ring.

              <P>(a) Except as noted under paragraph (c) of this section, to apply for measurement under this subpart, the vessel owner must complete an Application for Simplified Measurement (form CG-5397). If the vessel is documented, or intended to be documented, as a vessel of the United States under part 67 of this chapter, the vessel owner must submit the application form to the National Vessel Documentation Center. Otherwise, the form is not further processed, but may be retained, at the vessel owner's option, as evidence of the tonnage measurement under this part.</P>
              <P>(b) The Application for Simplified Measurement (form CG-5397) must include the following information:</P>

The volume of the principal deck structure of a vessel is determined by the product of its average dimensions.</P>
              <P>(5) If the overall depth of a vessel designed for sailing includes the keel, only 75 percent of that depth is used for gross tonnage calculations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Net register tonnage.</E> (1) For a vessel having propelling machinery in its hull—</P>
              <P>(i) The net register tonnage is 90 percent of its gross register tonnage, if it is a vessel designed for sailing; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The net register tonnage is 80 percent of its gross register tonnage, if it is not a vessel designed for sailing.</P>
              <P>(2) For a vessel having no propelling machinery in its hull, the net register tonnage is the same as its gross register tonnage.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Certification of measurement.</E> For a vessel that is documented as a vessel of the United States under part 67 of this chapter, the vessel's Certificate of Documentation serves as evidence of measurement under this subpart. For all other vessels, a completed Application for Simplified Measurement (form CG-5397) serves as evidence of the tonnage measurement under this part.</P>
