      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the HEAL program?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program is a program of Federal insurance of educational loans that were made to graduate students in the fields of medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatric medicine, pharmacy, public health, chiropractic, health administration, and clinical psychology. The basic purpose of the program is to encourage lenders to make loans to students in these fields who desire to borrow money to pay for their educational costs. In addition, certain nonstudents (such as doctors serving as interns or residents) could borrow in order to pay the current interest charges accruing on earlier HEAL loans. By taking a HEAL loan, the borrower is obligated to repay the lender or holder the full amount of the money borrowed, plus all interest which accrues on the loan.</P>
              <P>(b) HEAL loans were made by schools, banks, credit unions, State agencies, and other institutions eligible as lenders under § 681.30. HEAL school eligibility is described in § 681.50.</P>

              <P>(c) The Secretary insures each lender or holder for the losses of principal and interest it may incur in the event that a borrower dies; becomes totally and <PRTPAGE P="8"/>permanently disabled; files for bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act; files for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act and files a compliant to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan; or defaults on his or her loan. In these instances, if the lender or holder has complied with all HEAL statutes and regulations and with the lender's or holder's insurance contract, then the Secretary pays the amount of the loss to the lender or holder and the borrower's loan is assigned to the Secretary. Only after assignment does the Secretary become the holder of the HEAL loan and the Secretary will use all collection methods legally authorized to obtain repayment of the HEAL loan, including, but not limited to, reporting the borrower's default on the loan to consumer credit reporting agencies, certifying the debt for offset in the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), using available methods to locate the debtor, utilizing administrative wage garnishment, and referring the debt to the Department of Justice for litigation.</P>
              <P>(d) Any person who knowingly makes a false statement or misrepresentation in a HEAL loan transaction, bribes or attempts to bribe a Federal official, fraudulently obtains a HEAL loan, or commits any other illegal action in connection with a HEAL loan is subject to possible fine and imprisonment under Federal statute.</P>
              <P>(e) In counting the number of days allowed to comply with any provisions of these regulations, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays are to be included. However, if a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the due date is the next Federal work day.</P>

              <P>(3) A lender must disburse HEAL loan proceeds as described in § 681.33(f).</P>
              <P>(4) The lender or holder must provide the borrower with a copy of the repayment schedule before repayment begins.</P>
              <P>(5) If the loan is sold from one lender or holder to another lender or holder, or if the loan is serviced by a party other than the lender or holder, the buyer must notify the borrower within 30 days of the transaction.</P>
              <P>(6) The borrower does not have to begin repayment until 9 full months after leaving school or an accredited internship or residency program as described in § 681.11.</P>
              <P>(7) The borrower is entitled to deferment from repayment of the principal and interest installments during periods described in § 681.12.</P>

              <P>(3) For purposes of this paragraph, an academic year means the traditional approximately 9-month September-to-June annual session. For the purpose of computing academic year equivalents for students who, during a 12-month period, attend for a longer period than the traditional academic year, the academic year will be considered to be 9 months in length.</P>
              <P>(4) The student's estimated cost of attendance shall not exceed the estimated cost of attendance of all students in like circumstances pursuing a similar curriculum at that school.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Terms of repayment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Commencement of repayment.</E> (1) The borrower's repayment period begins the first day of the 10th month after the month he or she ceases to be a full-time student at a HEAL school. The 9-month period before the repayment period begins is popularly called the “grace period.”</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Postponement for internship or residency program.</E> However, if the borrower becomes an intern or resident in an accredited program within 9 full months after leaving school, then the borrower's repayment period begins the first day of the 10th month after the month he or she ceases to be an intern or resident. For a borrower who receives his or her first HEAL loan on or after October 22, 1985, this postponement of the beginning of the repayment period for participation in an internship or residency program is limited to 4 years.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Postponement for fellowship training or educational activity.</E> For any HEAL loan received on or after October 22, 1985, if the borrower becomes an intern or resident in an accredited program within 9 full months after leaving school, and subsequently enters into a fellowship training program or an educational activity, as described in § 681.12(b)(1) and (2), within 9 months after the completion of the accredited internship or residency program or prior to the completion of such program, the borrower's repayment period begins on the first day of the 10th month after the month he or she ceases to be a participant in the fellowship training program or educational activity. Postponement of the commencement of the repayment period for either activity is limited to 2 years.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Non-student borrower.</E> If a nonstudent borrower obtains another HEAL loan during the grace period or period of internship, residency, or deferment (as defined in § 681.12), the repayment period on this loan begins when repayment on the borrower's other HEAL loans begins or resumes.</P>
              <P>(2) An accredited internship or residency program must be approved by one of the following accrediting agencies:</P>
              <P>(i) Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.</P>
              <P>(ii) Council on Optometric Education.</P>
              <P>(iii) Commission on Accreditation of Dental and Dental Auxiliary Programs.</P>
              <P>(iv) American Osteopathic Association.</P>
              <P>(v) Council on Podiatry Education.</P>
              <P>(vi) American Council on Pharmaceutical Education.</P>
              <P>(vii) Council on Education for Public Health.</P>
              <P>(viii) American College of Veterinary Surgeons.</P>
              <P>(ix) Council on Chiropractic Education.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Length of repayment period.</E> In general, a lender or holder must allow a borrower at least 10 years, but not more than 25 years, to repay a loan calculated from the beginning of the repayment period. A borrower must fully repay a loan within 33 years from the date that the loan is made.</P>
              <P>(1) For a HEAL borrower who received any HEAL loan prior to October 22, 1985, periods of deferment (as described in § 681.12) are not included when calculating the 10 to 25 or 33 year limitations.</P>
              <P>(2) For a borrower who receives his or her first HEAL loan on or after October 22, 1985, periods of deferment (as described in § 681.12) are included when calculating the 33 year limitation, but are not included when calculating the 10 to 25 year limitation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Prepayment.</E> The borrower may prepay the whole or any part of the loan at any time without penalty.<PRTPAGE P="13"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Minimum annual payment.</E> During each year of repayment, a borrower's payments to all holders of his or her HEAL loans must total the interest that accrues during the year on all of the loans, unless the borrower, in the promissory note or other written agreement, agrees to make payments during any year or any repayment period in a lesser amount.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Repayment schedule agreement.</E> At least 30 and not more than 60 days before the commencement of the repayment period, a borrower must contact the holder of the loan to establish the precise terms of repayment. The borrower may select a monthly repayment schedule with substantially equal installment payments or a monthly repayment schedule with graduated installment payments that increase in amount over the repayment period. If the borrower does not contact the lender or holder and does not respond to contacts from the lender or holder, the lender or holder may establish a monthly repayment schedule with substantially equal installment payments, subject to the terms of the borrower's HEAL note.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Supplemental repayment agreement.</E> (1) A lender or holder and a borrower may enter into an agreement supplementing the regular repayment schedule agreement. Under a supplemental repayment agreement, the lender or holder agrees to consider that the borrower has met the terms of the regular repayment schedule as long as the borrower makes payments in accordance with the supplemental schedule.</P>
              <P>(2) The purpose of a supplemental repayment agreement is to permit a lender or holder, at its option, to offer a borrower a repayment schedule based on other than equal or graduated payments. (For example, a supplemental repayment agreement may base the amount of the borrower's payments on his or her income.)</P>
              <P>(3) The supplemental schedule must contain terms which, according to the Secretary, do not unduly burden the borrower and do not extend the Secretary's insurance liability beyond the number of years specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The supplemental schedule must be approved by the Secretary prior to the start of repayment.</P>
              <P>(4) The lender or holder may establish a supplemental repayment agreement over the borrower's objection only if the borrower's written consent to enter into a supplemental agreement was obtained by the lender at the time the loan was made.</P>
              <P>(5) A lender or holder may assign a loan subject to a supplemental repayment agreement only if it specifically notifies the buyer of the terms of the supplemental agreement. In such cases, the loan and the supplemental agreement must be assigned together.</P>
              <P>(6) As authorized by section 525 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, any repayment plan available under part B of title IV of the HEA (the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP)) is available for servicing, collecting, or enforcing HEAL loans. Such repayment plans are set forth in 34 CFR part 682, and in particular in §§ 682.102, 682.209, and 682.215.</P>

              <P>(2) Up to 4 years during which the borrower is a participant in an accredited internship or residency program, as described in § 681.11(a)(2). For a borrower who receives his or her first HEAL loan on or after October 22, 1985, this total of 4 years for an internship or residency program includes any period of postponement of the repayment period, as described in § 681.11(a)(1);</P>
              <P>(3) Up to 3 years during which the borrower is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States;</P>

              <P>(6) Up to 3 years during which the borrower is a full-time volunteer under title I of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973.</P>
              <P>(b) For any HEAL loan received on or after October 22, 1985, after the repayment period has commenced, installments of principal and interest need not be paid during any period for up to 2 years during which the borrower is a participant in:</P>
              <P>(1) A fellowship training program, which:</P>
              <P>(i) Is directly related to the discipline for which the borrower received the HEAL loan;</P>
              <P>(ii) Begins within 12 months after the borrower ceases to be a participant in an accredited internship or residency program, as described in § 681.11(a)(2), or prior to the completion of the borrower's participation in such program;</P>
              <P>(iii) Is a full-time activity in research or research training or health care policy;</P>
              <P>(iv) Is not a part of, an extension of, or associated with an internship or residency program, as described in § 681.11(a)(2);</P>
              <P>(v) Pays no stipend or one which is not more than the annual stipend level established by the Public Health Service for the payment of uniform levels of financial support for trainees receiving graduate and professional training under Public Health Service grants, as in effect at the time the borrower requests the deferment; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Is a formally established fellowship program which was not created for a specific individual; or</P>
              <P>(2) A full-time educational activity at an institution defined by section 435(b) of the HEA which:</P>
              <P>(i) Is directly related to the discipline for which the borrower received the HEAL loan;</P>
              <P>(ii) Begins within 12 months after the borrower ceases to be a participant in an accredited internship or residency program, as described in § 681.11(a)(2), or prior to the completion of the borrower's participation in such program;</P>
              <P>(iii) Is not a part of, an extension of, or associated with an internship or residency program, as described in § 681.11(a)(2); and</P>
              <P>(iv) Is required for licensure, registration, or certification in the State in which the borrower intends to practice the discipline for which the borrower received the HEAL loan.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) To receive a deferment, including a deferral of the onset of the repayment period (see § 681.11(a)), a borrower must at least 30 days prior to, but not more than 60 days prior to, the onset of the activity and annually thereafter, submit to the lender or holder evidence of his or her status in the deferment activity and evidence that verifies deferment eligibility of the activity (with the full expectation that the borrower will begin the activity). It is the responsibility of the borrower to provide the lender or holder with all required information or other information regarding the requested deferment. If written evidence that verifies eligibility of the activity and the borrower for the deferment, including a certification from an authorized official (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the director of the fellowship activity, the dean of the school, etc.), is received by the lender or holder within the required time limit, the lender or holder must approve the deferment. The lender or holder may rely in good faith upon statements of the borrower and the authorized official, except where those statements or other information conflict with information available to the lender or holder. When those verification statements or other information conflict with information available to the lender or holder, to indicate that the applicant fails to meet the requirements for deferment, the lender or holder may not approve the deferment until those conflicts are resolved.</P>

              <P>(2) For those activities described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the borrower may request that the Secretary review a decision by the lender or holder denying the deferment by sending to the Secretary copies of the application for deferment and the lender's or holder's denial of the request. However, if information submitted to the lender or holder conflicts with other information available to the lender or holder, to indicate that the <PRTPAGE P="15"/>borrower fails to meet the requirements for deferment, the borrower may not request a review until such conflicts have been resolved. During the review process, the lender or holder must comply with any requests for information made by the Secretary. If the Secretary determines that the fellowship or educational activity is eligible for deferment and so notifies the lender or holder, the lender or holder must approve the deferment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Interest.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Rate.</E> At the lender's option, the interest rate on the HEAL loan may be calculated on a fixed rate or on a variable rate basis. However, whichever method is selected must continue over the life of the loan, except where the loan is consolidated with another HEAL loan.</P>
              <P>(1) For all loans made on or after October 22, 1985, for each calendar quarter, the Secretary determines the maximum annual HEAL interest rate by determining the average of the bond equivalent rates reported for the 91-day U.S. Treasury bills auctioned for the preceding calendar quarter, adding 3 percentage points, and rounding that amount to the next higher one-eighth of 1 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) Interest that is calculated on a fixed rate basis is determined for the life of the loan during the calendar quarter in which the loan is executed. It may not exceed the rate determined for that quarter by the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Interest that is calculated on a variable rate basis varies every calendar quarter throughout the life of the loan as the market price of U.S. Treasury bills changes. For any quarter it may not exceed the rate determined by the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(4) The Secretary announces the rate determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section on a quarterly basis through a notice published on the Department's student aid Web site at <E T="03">www.ifap.ed.gov</E>.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compounding of interest.</E> Interest accrues from the date the loan is disbursed until the loan is paid in full. Unpaid accrued interest shall be compounded not more frequently than semiannually and added to principal. However, a lender or holder may postpone the compounding of interest before the beginning of the repayment period or during periods of deferment or forbearance and add interest to principal at the time repayment of principal begins or resumes.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment.</E> Repayment of principal and interest is due when the repayment period begins. A lender or holder must permit a borrower to postpone paying interest before the beginning of the repayment period or during a period of deferment or forbearance. In these cases, payment of interest begins or resumes on the date repayment of principal begins or resumes.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Usury laws.</E> No provision of any Federal or State law that limits the rate or amount of interest payable on loans shall apply to a HEAL loan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>The insurance premium.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The Secretary insures each lender or holder for the losses of principal and interest it may incur in the event that a borrower dies; becomes totally and permanently disabled; files for bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act; files for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act and files a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan; or defaults on his or her loan. For this insurance, the Secretary charges the lender an insurance premium. The insurance premium is due to the Secretary on the date of disbursement of the HEAL loan.</P>

              <P>(2) The lender may charge the borrower an amount equal to the cost of the insurance premium. The cost of the insurance premium may be charged to the borrower by the lender in the form of a one-time special charge with no subsequent adjustments required. The lender may bill the borrower separately for the insurance premium or may deduct an amount attributable to it from the loan proceeds before the loan is disbursed. In either case, the lender must clearly identify to the borrower the amount of the insurance premium and the method of calculation.<PRTPAGE P="16"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) If the lender does not pay the insurance premium on or before 30 days after disbursement of the loan, a late fee will be charged on a daily basis at the same rate as the interest rate that the lender charges for the HEAL loan for which the insurance premium is past due. The lender may not pass on this late fee to the borrower.</P>
              <P>(4) HEAL insurance coverage ceases to be effective if the insurance premium is not paid within 60 days of the disbursement of the loan.</P>
              <P>(5) Except in cases of error, premiums are not refundable by the Secretary, and need not be refunded by the lender to the borrower, even if the borrower graduates or withdraws from the school, defaults, dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Rate.</E> The rate of the insurance premium shall not exceed the statutory maximum. The Secretary announces changes in the rate of the insurance premium through a notice published on the Department's student aid Web site: <E T="03">www.ifap.ed.gov</E>.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Method of calculation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Student borrowers.</E> For loans disbursed prior to July 22, 1986, the lender must calculate the insurance premium on the basis of the number of months beginning with the month following the month in which the loan proceeds are disbursed to the student borrower and ending 9 full months after the month of the student's anticipated date of graduation. For loans disbursed on or after July 22, 1986, the insurance premium shall be calculated as a one-time flat rate on the principal of the loan at the time of disbursement.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Non-student borrowers.</E> For loans disbursed prior to July 22, 1986, the lender must calculate the insurance premium for nonstudent borrowers on the basis of the number of months beginning with the month following the month in which the loan proceeds are disbursed to the borrower and ending at the conclusion of the month preceding the month in which repayment of principal is expected to begin or resume on the borrower's previous HEAL loans. For loans disbursed on or after July 22, 1986, the insurance premium shall be calculated as a one-time flat rate on the principal of the loan at the time of disbursement.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Multiple installments.</E> In cases where the lender disburses the loan in multiple installments, the insurance premium is calculated for each disbursement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Other charges to the borrower.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Late charges.</E> If the borrower fails to pay all of a required installment payment or fails to provide written evidence that verifies eligibility for the deferment of the payment within 30 days after the payment's due date, the lender or holder will require that the borrower pay a late charge. A late charge must be equal to 5 percent of the unpaid portion of the payment due.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Collection charges.</E> The lender or holder may also require that the borrower pay the holder of the note for reasonable costs incurred by the holder or its agent in collecting any installment not paid when due. These costs may include attorney's fees, court costs, telegrams, and long-distance phone calls. The holder may not charge the borrower for the normal costs associated with preparing letters and making personal and local telephone contacts with the borrower. A service agency's fee for normal servicing of a loan may not be passed on to the borrower, either directly or indirectly. No charges, other than those authorized by this section, may be passed on to the borrower, either directly or indirectly, without prior approval of the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Other loan making costs.</E> A lender may not pass on to the borrower any cost of making a HEAL loan other than the costs of the insurance premium.</P>

              <P>Neither a lender nor a school may obtain a borrower's power of attorney or other authorization to endorse a disbursement check on behalf of a borrower. The borrower must personally endorse the check and may not authorize anyone else to endorse it on his or her behalf.</P>

              <P>After paying a default claim on a HEAL loan, the Secretary attempts to collect from the borrower and any valid endorser in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 101 through 105), the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-129, issued January 2013, and the Department's Claims Collection Regulation (34 CFR parts 30, 31, and 34). The Secretary attempts collection of all unpaid principal, interest, penalties, administrative costs, and other charges or fees, except in the following situations:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">The borrower has a valid defense on the loan.</E> The Secretary refrains from collection against the borrower or endorser to the extent of any defense that the Secretary concludes is valid. Examples of a valid defense include infancy or proof of repayment in part or in full.</P>

If the borrower dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled, the Secretary also terminates all collection activity against any endorser.</P>

              <P>(b) In determining whether to enter into an insurance contract with an applicant and what the terms of that contract should be, the Secretary may consider the following criteria:</P>

              <SUBJECT>The HEAL lender or holder insurance contract.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a)(1) If the Secretary approves an application to be a HEAL lender or holder, the Secretary and the lender or holder must sign an insurance contract. Under this contract, the lender or holder agrees to comply with all the laws, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its participation in the HEAL program and the Secretary agrees to insure each eligible HEAL loan held by the lender or holder against the borrower's default, death, total and permanent disability, bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act, or bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act when the borrower files a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan. The Secretary's insurance covers 100 percent of the lender's or holder's <PRTPAGE P="19"/>losses on both unpaid principal and interest, except to the extent that a borrower may have a defense on the loan other than infancy.</P>
              <P>(2) HEAL insurance, however, is not unconditional. The Secretary issues HEAL insurance on the implied representations of the lender that all the requirements for the initial insurability of the loan have been met. HEAL insurance is further conditioned upon compliance by the holder of the loan with the HEAL statute and regulations, the lender's or holder's insurance contract, and its own loan management procedures set forth in writing pursuant to § 681.31(c). The contract may contain a limit on the duration of the contract and the number or amount of HEAL loans a lender may make or hold. Each HEAL lender has either a standard insurance contract or a comprehensive insurance contract with the Secretary, as described below.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Standard insurance contract.</E> A lender with a standard insurance contract must submit to the Secretary a borrower's loan application for HEAL insurance on each loan that the lender determines to be eligible. The Secretary notifies the lender whether the loan is or is not insurable, the amount of the insurance, and the expiration date of the insurance commitment. A loan which has been disbursed under a standard contract of insurance prior to the Secretary's approval of the application is considered not to have been insured.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) <E T="03">Comprehensive insurance contract.</E> A lender with a comprehensive insurance contract may disburse a loan without submitting an individual borrower's loan application to the Secretary for approval. All eligible loans made by a lender with this type of contract are insured immediately upon disbursement.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary will revoke the comprehensive contract of any lender who utilizes procedures which are inconsistent with the HEAL statute and regulations, the lender's insurance contract, or its own loan management procedures set forth in writing pursuant to § 681.31(c), and require that such lenders disburse HEAL loans only under a standard contract. When the Secretary determines that the lender is in compliance with the HEAL statute and regulations and its own loan management procedures set forth in writing pursuant to § 681.31(c), the lender may reapply for a comprehensive contract.</P>
              <P>(3) In providing comprehensive contracts, the Secretary shall give priority to eligible lenders that:</P>
              <P>(i) Make loans to students at interest rates below the rates prevailing during the period involved; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Make loans under terms that are otherwise favorable to the student relative to the terms under which eligible lenders are generally making loans during the period involved.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Making a HEAL loan.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The loan-making process includes the processing of necessary forms, the approval of a borrower for a loan, determination of a borrower's creditworthiness, the determination of the loan amount (not to exceed the amount approved by the school), the explanation to a borrower of his or her responsibilities under the loan, the execution of the promissory note, and the disbursement of the loan proceeds. A lender may rely in good faith upon statements of an applicant and the HEAL school contained in the loan application papers, except where those statements are in conflict with information obtained from the report on the applicant's credit history, or other information available to the lender. Except where the statements are in conflict with information obtained from the applicant's credit history or other information available to the lender, a lender making loans to nonstudent borrowers may rely in good faith upon statements by the borrower and authorizing officials of internship, residency, or other programs for which a borrower may receive a deferment.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Processing of forms.</E> Before making a HEAL loan, a lender must determine that all required forms have been completed by the borrower, the HEAL school, the lender, and the authorized official for an internship, a residency, or other deferment activity.<PRTPAGE P="20"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Approval of borrower.</E> A lender may make a HEAL loan only to an eligible student or nonstudent borrower.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Lender determination of the borrower's creditworthiness.</E> The lender may make HEAL loans only to an applicant that the lender has determined to be creditworthy. This determination must be made at least once for each academic year during which the applicant applies for a HEAL loan. An applicant will be determined to be “creditworthy” if he or she has a repayment history that has been satisfactory on any loans on which payments have become due. The lender may not determine that an applicant is creditworthy if the applicant is currently in default on any loan (commercial, consumer, or educational) until the delinquent account is made current or satisfactory arrangements are made between the affected lender(s) and the HEAL applicant. The lender must obtain documentation, such as a letter from the authorized official(s) of the affected lender(s) or a corrected credit report indicating that the HEAL applicant has taken satisfactory actions to bring the account into good standing. It is the responsibility of the HEAL loan applicant to assure that the lender receives each such documentation. No loan may be made to an applicant who is delinquent on any Federal debt until the delinquent account is made current or satisfactory arrangements are made between the affected agency and the HEAL applicant. The lender must receive a letter from the authorized Federal official of the affected Federal agency stating that the borrower has taken satisfactory actions to bring the account into good standing. It is the responsibility of the loan applicant to assure that the lender has received each such letter. The absence of any previous credit, however, is not an indication that the applicant is not creditworthy and is not to be used as a reason to deny the status of creditworthy to an applicant. The lender must determine the creditworthiness of the applicant using, at a minimum, the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A report of the applicant's credit history obtained from an appropriate consumer credit reporting agency, which must be used in making the determinations required by paragraph (c) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) For student applicants only, the certification made by the applicant's school under § 681.51(e).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of loan amount.</E> A lender may not make a HEAL loan in an amount that exceeds the permissible annual and aggregate maximums described in § 681.10.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Promissory note.</E> (1) Each loan must be evidenced by a promissory note approved by the Secretary. A lender must obtain the Secretary's prior approval of the note form before it makes a HEAL loan evidenced by a promissory note containing any deviation from the provisions of the form most currently approved by the Secretary. The lender must give the borrower a copy of each executed note.</P>
              <P>(2) The lender must explain to the borrower that the loan must be repaid and that the loan proceeds may be applied toward educational expenses only.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Disbursement of HEAL loan.</E> (1) A lender must disburse HEAL loan proceeds:</P>
              <P>(i) To a student borrower, by means of a check or draft payable jointly to the student borrower and the HEAL school. Except where a lender is also a school, a lender must mail the check or draft to the school. A lender may not disburse the loan proceeds earlier than is reasonably necessary to meet the cost of education for the period for which the loan is made.</P>
              <P>(ii) To a nonstudent borrower, by means of a check or draft payable to the borrower. However, when a previous loan is held by a different lender, the current lender must make the HEAL loan disbursement check or draft payable jointly to the borrower and the holder of the previous HEAL loan for which interest is payable.</P>

              <P>(2) Effective July 1, 1987, a lender must disburse the HEAL loan proceeds in two or more installments unless the loan is intended to cover a period of no more than one-half an academic year. The amount disbursed at one time must correspond to the borrower's educational expenses for the period for which the disbursement is made, and must be indicated by the school on the borrower's application. If the loan is <PRTPAGE P="21"/>intended for more than one-half an academic year, the school must indicate on the borrower's application both the approximate dates of disbursement and the amount the borrower will need on each such date. In no case may the lender disburse the proceeds earlier than is reasonably necessary to meet the costs of education for the period for which the disbursement or the loan is made.</P>
              <P>(g) If the lender determines that the applicant is not creditworthy, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the lender must not approve the HEAL loan request. If the applicant is a student, the lender must notify the applicant and the applicant's school named on the application form of the denial of a HEAL loan, stating the reason for the denial.</P>
              <P>(h) The lender must report a borrower's HEAL indebtedness to one or more national credit bureaus within 120 days of the date the final disbursement on the loan is made.</P>

Lenders or holders may not charge borrowers for the additional interest or other charges, penalties, or fees that accrue when a lender or holder does not contact the borrower within this time period and a late conversion results.</P>
              <P>(2) Terms of repayment are established in a written schedule that is made a part of, and subject to the terms of, the borrower's original HEAL note.</P>
              <P>(3) The lender or holder may not surrender the original promissory note to the borrower until the loan is paid in full. At that time, the lender or holder must give the borrower the original promissory note.</P>

The lender or holder must use this notice to remind the borrower of the option, without penalty, to pay all or part of the principal and accrued interest at any time.</P>

              <SUBJECT>HEAL loan collection.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A lender or holder must exercise due diligence in the collection of a HEAL loan with respect to both a borrower and any endorser. In order to exercise due diligence, a lender or holder must implement the following procedures when a borrower fails to honor his or her payment obligations:</P>

              <P>(a) When a borrower is delinquent in making a payment, the lender or holder must remind the borrower within 15 days of the date the payment was due by means of a written contact. If payments do not resume, the lender or holder must contact both the borrower and any endorser at least 3 more times at regular intervals during the 120-day delinquent period following the first missed payment of that 120-day period. The second demand notice for a delinquent account must inform the borrower that the continued delinquent status of the account will be reported to consumer credit reporting agencies <PRTPAGE P="22"/>if payment is not made. Each of the required four contacts must consist of at least a written contact which has an address correction request on the envelope. The last contact must consist of a telephone contact, in addition to the required letter, unless the borrower cannot be contacted by telephone. The lender or holder may choose to substitute a personal contact for a telephone contact. A record must be made of each attempt to contact and each actual contact, and that record must be placed in the borrower's file. Each contact must become progressively firmer in tone. If the lender or holder is unable to locate the borrower and any endorser at any time during the period when the borrower is delinquent, the lender or holder must initiate the skip-tracing procedures described in § 681.34(d).</P>
              <P>(b) When a borrower is 90 days delinquent in making a payment, the lender or holder must immediately request preclaim assistance from the Department's servicer. The Secretary does not pay a default claim if the lender or holder fails to request preclaim assistance.</P>
              <P>(c) Prior to the filing of a default claim, a lender or holder must use, at a minimum, collection practices that are at least as extensive and effective as those used by the lender or holder in the collection of its other loans. These practices must include, but need not be limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Using collection agents, which may include its own collection department or other internal collection agents;</P>
              <P>(2) Immediately notifying an appropriate consumer credit reporting agency regarding accounts overdue by more than 60 days; and</P>
              <P>(3) Commencing and prosecuting an action for default unless:</P>
              <P>(i) In the determination of the Secretary that:</P>
              <P>(A) The lender or holder has made reasonable efforts to serve process on the borrower involved and has been unsuccessful in these efforts; or</P>
              <P>(B) Prosecution of such an action would be fruitless because of the financial or other circumstances of the borrower;</P>
              <P>(ii) For loans made before November 4, 1988, the loan involved was made in an amount of less than $5,000; or</P>
              <P>(iii) For loans made on or after November 4, 1988, the loan involved was made in an amount of less than $2,500.</P>
              <P>(d) If the Secretary's preclaim assistance locates the borrower, the lender or holder must implement the loan collection procedures described in this section. When the Secretary's preclaim assistance is unable to locate the borrower, a default claim may be filed by the lender as described in § 681.40. The Secretary does not pay a default claim if the lender or holder has not complied with the HEAL statute and regulations or the lender's or holder's insurance contract.</P>
              <P>(e) If a lender or holder does not sue the borrower, it must send a final demand letter to the borrower and any endorser at least 30 days before a default claim is filed.</P>
              <P>(f) If a lender or holder sues a defaulted borrower or endorser, it may first apply the proceeds of any judgment against its reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, whether or not the judgment provides for these fees and costs.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Collection of chapter 7 bankruptcies.</E> (1) If a borrower files for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act and does not file a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan, the lender or holder is responsible for monitoring the bankruptcy case in order to pursue collection of the loan after the bankruptcy proceedings have been completed.</P>

              <P>(i) For any loan for which the lender or holder had not begun to litigate against the borrower prior to the imposition of the automatic stay, the period of the automatic stay is to be considered as an extended forbearance authorized by the Secretary, in addition to the 2-year period of forbearance which lenders and holders are authorized to grant without prior approval from the Secretary. Only periods of delinquency following the date of receipt (as documented by a date stamp) of the discharge of debtor notice (or other written notification from the court or the borrower's attorney of the end of the automatic stay imposed by the Bankruptcy Court) can be included in <PRTPAGE P="23"/>determining default, as described in § 681.40(c)(1)(i). The lender or holder must attempt to reestablish repayment terms with the borrower in writing no more than 30 days after receipt of the discharge of debtor notice (or other written notification from the court or the borrower's attorney of the end of the automatic stay imposed by the Bankruptcy Court), in accordance with the procedures followed at the end of a forbearance period. If the borrower fails to make a payment as scheduled, the lender or holder must attempt to obtain repayment through written and telephone contacts in accordance with the intervals established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and must perform the other HEAL loan collection activities required in this section, before filing a default claim.</P>
              <P>(ii) For any loan for which the lender or holder had begun to litigate against the borrower prior to the imposition of the automatic stay, the lender or holder must, upon written notification from the court or the borrower's attorney that the bankruptcy proceedings have been completed, either resume litigation or treat the loan in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the lender or holder has not received written notification of discharge within 12 months of the date that the borrower filed for bankruptcy, the lender or holder must contact the court and the borrower's attorney (if known) within 30 days to determine if the bankruptcy proceedings have been completed. If no response is received within 30 days of the date of these contacts, the lender or holder must resume its collection efforts, in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If a written response from the court or the borrower's attorney indicates that the bankruptcy proceedings are still underway, the lender or holder is not to pursue further collection efforts until receipt of written notice of discharge, except that follow-up in accordance with this paragraph must be done at least once every 12 months until the bankruptcy proceedings have been completed. A lender or holder may utilize PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) in place of contact with the court and/or borrower's attorney.</P>

              <P>(3) If, despite the lender or holder's compliance with required procedures, a loan subject to the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section is discharged, the lender or holder must file a claim with the Secretary within 10 days of the initial date of receipt (as documented by a date stamp) of written notification of the discharge from the court or the borrower's attorney, in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 681.40(c)(4). The lender or holder also must file with the bankruptcy court an objection to the discharge of the HEAL loan, and must include with the claim documentation showing that the bankruptcy proceedings were handled properly and expeditiously (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> all documents sent to or received from the bankruptcy court, including evidence which shows the period of the bankruptcy proceedings).</P>

              <P>(2) If the lender or holder determines that the default of the borrower is inevitable and that forbearance will be ineffective in preventing default, the <PRTPAGE P="24"/>lender or holder may submit a claim to the Secretary rather than grant forbearance. If the Secretary is not in agreement with the determination of the lender or holder, the claim will be returned to the lender or holder as disapproved and forbearance must be granted.</P>
              <P>(b) A lender or holder must exercise forbearance in accordance with terms that are consistent with the 25- and 33-year limitations on the length of repayment (described in § 681.11) if the lender or holder and borrower agree in writing to the new terms. Each forbearance period may not exceed 6 months.</P>
              <P>(c) A lender or holder may also exercise forbearance for periods of up to 6 months in accordance with terms that are inconsistent with the minimum annual payment requirement if the lender or holder complies with the requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. Subsequent renewals of the forbearance must also be documented in accordance with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The lender or holder must reasonably believe that the borrower intends to repay the loan but is currently unable to make payments in accordance with the terms of the loan note. The lender or holder must state the basis for its belief in writing and maintain that statement in its loan file on that borrower.</P>
              <P>(2) Both the borrower and an authorized official of the lender or holder must sign a written agreement of forbearance.</P>
              <P>(3) If the agreement between the borrower and lender or holder provides for forbearance of all payments, the lender or holder must contact the borrower at least every 3 months during the period of forbearance in order to remind the borrower of the outstanding obligation to repay.</P>
              <P>(4) The total period of forbearance (with or without interruption) granted by the lender or holder to any borrower must not exceed 2 years. However, when the borrower and the lender or holder believe that there are bona fide reasons why this period should be extended, the lender or holder may request a reasonable extension beyond the 2-year period from the Secretary. This request must document the reasons why the extension should be granted. The lender or holder may grant the extension for the approved time period if the Secretary approves the extension request.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Assignment of a HEAL loan.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A HEAL note may not be assigned except to another HEAL lender or organization as specified in § 681.30 and except as provided in § 681.40. In this section “seller” means any kind of assignor and “buyer” means any kind of assignee.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> A HEAL note assigned from one lender or holder to another must be subject to a blanket endorsement together with other HEAL notes being assigned or must individually bear effective words of assignment. Either the blanket endorsement or the HEAL note must be signed and dated by an authorized official of the seller. Within 30 days of the transaction, the buyer must notify the following parties of the assignment:</P>
              <P>(1) The Secretary; and</P>
              <P>(2) The borrower. The notice to the borrower must contain a clear statement of all the borrower's rights and responsibilities which arise from the assignment of the loan, including a statement regarding the consequences of making payments to the seller subsequent to receipt of the notice.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Risks assumed by the buyer.</E> Upon acquiring a HEAL loan, a new holder assumes responsibility for the consequences of any previous violations of applicable statutes, regulations, or the terms of the note except for defects under § 681.41(d). A HEAL note is not a negotiable instrument, and a subsequent holder is not a holder in due course. If the borrower has a valid legal defense that could be asserted against the previous holder, the borrower can also assert the defense against the new holder. In this situation, if the new holder files a default claim on a loan, the Secretary denies the default claim to the extent of the borrower's defense. Furthermore, when a new holder files a claim on a HEAL loan, it must provide <PRTPAGE P="25"/>the Secretary with the same documentation that would have been required of the original lender.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Warranty.</E> Nothing in this section precludes the buyer of a HEAL loan from obtaining a warranty from the seller covering certain future reductions by the Secretary in computing the amount of insurable loss, if any, on a claim filed on the loan. The warranty may only cover reductions which are attributable to an act or failure to act of the seller or other previous holder. The warranty may not cover matters for which the buyer is charged with responsibility under the HEAL regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Bankruptcy.</E> If a lender or holder assigns a HEAL loan to a new holder, or a new holder acquires a HEAL loan under 20 U.S.C. 1092a (the Combined Payment Plan authority), and the previous holder(s) subsequently receives court notice that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy, the previous holder(s) must forward the bankruptcy notice to the purchaser within 10 days of the initial date of receipt, as documented by a date stamp, except that if it is a chapter 7 bankruptcy with no complaint for dismissal, the previous holder(s) must file the notice with the purchaser within 30 days of the initial date of receipt, as documented by a date stamp. The previous holder(s) also must file a statement with the court notifying it of the change of ownership. Notwithstanding the above, the current holder will not be held responsible for any loss due to the failure of the prior holder(s) to meet the deadline for giving notice if such failure occurs after the current holder purchased the loan.</P>

The holder of the loan may not attempt to collect on the loan from the borrower's estate or any endorser. The holder must secure a certification of death or whatever official proof is conclusive under State law.

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for filing claims.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A lender or holder must file an insurance claim on a form approved by the Secretary. The lender or holder must attach to the claim all documentation necessary to litigate a default, including any documents required to be submitted by the Federal Claims Collection Standards, and which the Secretary may require. Failure to submit the required documentation and to comply with the HEAL statute and regulations or the lender's or holder's insurance contract will result in a claim not being honored. The Secretary may deny a claim that is not filed within the period specified in this section. The Secretary requires for all claims at least the following documentation:</P>
              <P>(1) The original promissory note;</P>
              <P>(2) An assignment to the United States of America of all right, title, and interest of the lender or holder in the note;</P>
              <P>(3) The loan application;</P>
              <P>(4) The history of the loan activities from the date of loan disbursement through the date of claim, including any payments made; and</P>
              <P>(5) A Borrower Status Form (HEAL-508), documenting each deferment granted under § 681.12 or a written statement from an appropriate official stating that the borrower was engaged in an activity for which he or she was entitled to receive a deferment at the time the deferment was granted.</P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary's payment of a claim is contingent upon receipt of all required documentation and an assignment to the United States of America of all right, title, and interest of the lender or holder in the note underlying the claim. The lender or holder must warrant that the loan is eligible for HEAL insurance.</P>

              <P>(c) In addition, the lender or holder must comply with the following requirements for the filing of default, <PRTPAGE P="26"/>death, disability, and bankruptcy claims:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Default claims. Default</E> means the persistent failure of the borrower to make a payment when due or to comply with other terms of the note or other written agreement evidencing a loan under circumstances where the Secretary finds it reasonable to conclude that the borrower no longer intends to honor the obligation to repay the loan. In the case of a loan repayable (or on which interest is payable) in monthly installments, this failure must have persisted for 120 days. In the case of a loan repayable (or on which interest is payable) in less frequent installments, this failure must have persisted for 180 days. If, for a particular loan, an automatic stay is imposed on collection activities by a Bankruptcy Court, and the lender or holder receives written notification of the automatic stay prior to initiating legal proceedings against the borrower, the 120- or 180-day period does not include any period prior to the end of the automatic stay.</P>
              <P>(i) If a lender or holder determines that it is not appropriate to commence and prosecute an action against a default borrower pursuant to § 681.35(c)(3), it must file a default claim with the Secretary within 30 days after a loan has been determined to be in default.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a lender files suit against a defaulted borrower and does not pursue collection of the judgment obtained as a result of the suit, it must file a default claim with the Secretary within 60 days of the date of issuance of the judgment. If a lender or holder files suit against a defaulted borrower, and pursues collection of the judgment obtained as a result of the suit, these collection activities must begin within 60 days of the date of issuance of the judgment. If the lender or holder is unable to collect the full amount of principal and interest owed, a claim must be filed within 30 days of completion of the post-judgment collection activities. In either case, the lender or holder must assign the judgment to the Secretary as part of the default claim.</P>
              <P>(iii) In addition to the documentation required for all claims, the lender or holder must submit with its default claim at least the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Repayment schedule(s);</P>
              <P>(B) A collection history, if any;</P>
              <P>(C) A final demand letter;</P>
              <P>(D) The original or a copy of all correspondence relevant to the HEAL loan to or from the borrower (whether received by the original lender, a subsequent holder, or an independent servicing agent);</P>
              <P>(E) A claims collection litigation report; and</P>
              <P>(F) If the defaulted borrower filed for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act and did not file a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the loan, all documents sent to or received from the bankruptcy court, including evidence which shows the period of the bankruptcy proceedings.</P>
              <P>(iv) If a lender or holder files a default claim on a loan and subsequently receives written notice from the court or the borrower's attorney that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act, or under chapter 7 with a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the loan, the lender or holder must file that notice with the Secretary within 10 days of the lender or holder's initial date of receipt, as documented by a date stamp. If the borrower is declaring bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act, and has not filed a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the loan, the lender or holder must file the written notice with the Secretary within 30 days of the lender's or holder's initial date of receipt, as documented by a date stamp. If the Secretary has not paid the claim at the time the lender or holder receives that notice, upon receipt of the notice, the lender or holder must file with the bankruptcy court a proof of claim, if applicable, and an objection to the discharge or compromise of the HEAL loan. If the Secretary has paid the claim, the lender or holder must file a statement with the court notifying it that the loan is owned by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Death claims.</E> A lender or holder must file a death claim with the Secretary within 30 days after the lender or holder obtains documentation that a borrower is dead. In addition to the documentation required for all claims, <PRTPAGE P="27"/>the lender or holder must submit with its death claim those documents which verify the death, including an official copy of the Death Certificate.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Disability claims.</E> A lender or holder must file a disability claim with the Secretary within 30 days after it has been notified that the Secretary has determined a borrower to be totally and permanently disabled. In addition to the documentation required for all claims, the lender or holder must submit with its claim evidence of the Secretary's determination that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Bankruptcy claims.</E> For a bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act, or a bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act when the borrower files a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan, the current holder must file a claim with the Secretary within 10 days of the initial date of receipt of court notice or written notice from the borrower's attorney that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 or chapter 13, or has filed a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan under chapter 7. The initial date of receipt of the written notice must be documented by a date stamp. The lender or holder must file with the bankruptcy court a proof of claim, if applicable, and an objection to the discharge or compromise of the HEAL loan. In addition to the documentation required for all claims, with its claim the lender or holder must submit to the Secretary at least the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Repayment schedule(s);</P>
              <P>(ii) A collection history, if any;</P>
              <P>(iii) A proof of claim, where applicable;</P>
              <P>(iv) An assignment to the United States of America of its proof of claim, where applicable;</P>
              <P>(v) All pertinent documents sent to or received from the bankruptcy court;</P>
              <P>(vi) A statement of any facts of which the lender is aware that may form the basis for an objection to the bankrupt's discharge or an exception to the discharge;</P>
              <P>(vii) The notice of the first meeting or creditors, or an explanation as to why this is not included;</P>
              <P>(viii) In cases where there is defective service, a declaration or affidavit attesting to the fact that the lender or holder was not directly served with the notice of meeting of creditors. This declaration or affidavit must also indicate when and how the lender or holder learned of the bankruptcy; and</P>
              <P>(ix) In cases where there is defective service due to the borrower's failure to list the proper creditor, a copy of the letter sent to the borrower at the time of purchase of the HEAL loan by the current holder, or a sample letter with documentation indicating when the letter was sent to the borrower.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination of amount of loss on claims.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> HEAL insurance covers the unpaid balance of principal and interest on an eligible HEAL loan, less the amount of any judgment collected pursuant to default proceedings commenced by the eligible lender or holder involved. In determining whether to approve an insurance claim for payment, the Secretary considers legal defects affecting the initial validity or insurability of the loan. The Secretary also deducts from a claim any amount that is not a legally enforceable obligation of the borrower except to the extent that the defense of infancy applies. The Secretary further considers whether all holders of the loan have complied with the requirements of the HEAL regulations, including those concerned with the making, servicing, and collecting of the loan, the timely filing of claims, and the submission of documents with a claim.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Special rules for loans acquired by assignment.</E> If a claim is filed by a lender or holder that obtained a loan by assignment, that lender or holder is not entitled to any payment under this section greater than that to which a previous holder would have been entitled. In particular, the Secretary deducts from the claim any amounts that are attributable to payments made by the borrower to a prior holder of the loan before the borrower received proper notice of the assignment of the loan.<PRTPAGE P="28"/>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Special rules for loans made by school lenders.</E> (1) If the loan for which a claim is filed was originally made by a school and the claim is filed by that school, the Secretary deducts from the claim an amount equal to any unpaid refund that the school owes the borrower.</P>
              <P>(2) If the loan for which a claim is filed was originally made by a school but the claim is filed by another lender of holder that obtained the note by assignment, the Secretary deducts from the claim an amount equal to any unpaid refund that the school owed the borrower prior to the assignment.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Circumstances under which defects in claims may be cured or excused.</E> The Secretary may permit a lender or holder to cure certain defects in a specified manner as a condition for payment of a default claim. The Secretary may excuse certain defects if the holder submitting the default claim satisfies the Secretary that the defect did not contribute to the default or prejudice the Secretary's attempt to collect the loan from the borrower. The Secretary may also excuse certain defects if the defect arose while the loan was held by another lender or holder and the holder submitting the default claim satisfies the Secretary that the assignment of the loan was an arm's length transaction, that the present holder did not know of the defect at the time of the sale and that the present holder could not have become aware of the defect through an examination of the loan documents.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Payment of insured interest.</E> The payment on an approved claim covers the unpaid principal balance and interest that accrues through the date the claim is paid, except:</P>
              <P>(1) If the lender or holder failed to submit a claim within the required period after the borrower's default; death; total and permanent disability; or filing of a petition in bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act, or under chapter 7 where the borrower files a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan; the Secretary does not pay interest that accrued between the end of that period and the date the Secretary received the claim.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary returned the claim to the lender or holder for additional documentation necessary for the approval of the claim, the Secretary pays interest only for the first 30 days following the return of the claim to the lender or holder.</P>

              <P>(2) The lender or holder must maintain for each borrower a payment history showing the date and amount of each payment received on the borrower's behalf, and the amounts of each payment attributable to principal and interest. A lender or holder must also maintain for each loan a collection history showing the date and subject of each communication with a borrower or endorser for collection of a delinquent loan. Furthermore, a lender or holder must keep any additional records which are necessary to make any reports required by the Secretary.</P>

              <P>(3) A lender or holder must retain the records required for each loan for not less than 5 years following the date the <PRTPAGE P="29"/>loan is repaid in full by the borrower.

              <P>(a) The Secretary may limit, suspend, or terminate the eligibility under the HEAL program of an otherwise eligible lender or holder that violates or fails to comply with any provision of the Act, these regulations, or agreements with the Secretary concerning the HEAL program. Prior to terminating a lender or holder's participation in the program, the Secretary will provide the entity an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the procedures under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

If the entity requests a hearing, it must, within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit material, factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause for a hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The hearing will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Secretary will deny a hearing if:</P>
              <P>(i) The request for a hearing is untimely (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> fails to meet the 30-day requirement);</P>

              <P>(iii) The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or inconsequential.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event that the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretary will send a written denial, by certified mail, to the lender or holder setting forth the reasons for denial. If a hearing is denied, or if as a result of the hearing, termination is still determined to be necessary, the lender or holder will be terminated from participation in the program. An entity will be permitted to reapply for participation in the program when it demonstrates, and the Secretary agrees, that it is in compliance with all HEAL requirements.</P>

              <P>(1)(i) The school must be legally authorized within a State to conduct a course of study leading to one of the following degrees:</P>
              <P>(A) Doctor of Medicine.</P>

              <SUBJECT>The student loan application.</SUBJECT>
              <P>When the student completes his or her portion of the student loan application and submits it to the school, the school must do the following:</P>
              <P>(a) Accurately and completely fill out its portion of the HEAL application;</P>
              <P>(b) Verify, to the best of its ability, the information provided by the student on the HEAL application, including, but not limited to, citizenship status and Social Security number. To comply with this requirement, the school may request that the student provide a certified copy of his or her birth certificate, his or her naturalization papers, and an original Social Security card or copy issued by the Federal Government, or other documentation that the school may require. The school must assure that the applicant's I-151 or I-551 is attached to the application, if the applicant is required to possess such identification by the United States;</P>
              <P>(c) Certify that the student is eligible to receive a HEAL loan, according to the requirements of § 681.5;</P>
              <P>(d) Review the financial aid transcript from each institution previously attended by the applicant on at least a half-time basis to determine whether the applicant is in default on any loans or owes a refund on any grants. The school may not approve the HEAL application or disburse HEAL funds if the borrower is in default on any loans or owes a refund on any educational grants, unless satisfactory arrangements have been made between the borrower and the affected lender or school to resolve the default or the refund on the grant. If the financial aid transcript has been requested, but has not been received at the time the applicant submits his or her first HEAL application, the school may approve the application and disburse the first HEAL installment prior to receipt of the transcript. Each financial aid transcript must include at least the following data:</P>
              <P>(1) Student's name;</P>
              <P>(2) Amounts and sources of loans and grants previously received by the student for study at an institution of higher education;</P>
              <P>(3) Whether the student is in default on any of these loans, or owes a refund on any grants;</P>
              <P>(4) Certification from each institution attended by the student that the student has received no financial aid, if applicable; and</P>
              <P>(5) From each institution attended, the signature of an official authorized by the institution to sign such transcripts on behalf of the institution;</P>
              <P>(e) State that it has no reason to believe that the borrower may not be willing to repay the HEAL loan;</P>
              <P>(f) Make reasonable determinations of the maximum loan amount approvable, based on the student's circumstances. The student applicant determines the amount he or she wishes to borrow, up to this maximum amount. Only then may the school certify an eligible application. In determining the maximum loan amount approvable, the school will calculate the difference between:</P>
              <P>(1) The total financial resources available to the applicant for his or her costs of education for the period covered by the proposed HEAL loan, and other student aid that the applicant has received or will receive during the period covered by the proposed HEAL loan. To determine the total financial resources available to the applicant for his or her costs of education for the period covered by the proposed HEAL loan (including familial, spousal, or personal income or other financial assistance that the applicant has received or will receive), the school must consider information provided through one of the national need analysis systems or any other procedure approved by the Secretary of Education, in addition to any other information which the school has regarding the student's financial situation. The school may make adjustments to the need analysis information only when necessary to accurately reflect the applicant's actual resources, and must maintain in the borrower's record documentation to support the basis for any adjustments to the need analysis information; and</P>

              <P>(2) The costs reasonably necessary for each student to pursue the same or similar curriculum or program within the same class year at the school for the period covered by the proposed <PRTPAGE P="32"/>HEAL loan, using a standard student budget. The school must maintain in its general office records the criteria used to develop each standard student budget. Adjustments to the standard student budget may be made only to the extent that they are necessary for the student to complete his or her education, and documentation must be maintained in the borrower's record to support the basis for any adjustments to the standard student budget.</P>
              <P>(g) Comply with the requirements of § 681.61.</P>

              <P>(1) If the school receives the instrument after the student is enrolled, obtain the student's endorsement, retain that portion of funds due the school, and disburse the remaining funds to the student.</P>
              <P>(2) If the school receives the instrument before the student is enrolled, it must, prior to endorsing the instrument, send the instrument to the student to endorse and return to the school. The school may then retain that portion of funds then due the school but must hold the remaining funds for disbursement to the student at the time of enrollment. However, if the student is unable to meet other educational expenses due before the time of enrollment, the school may obtain the student's endorsement and disburse to the student that portion of funds required to meet these other educational expenses.</P>

Each notice must contain the student's full name under which the loan was received, the student's current name (if different), the student's Social Security number, the date of the change in the enrollment status, or failure to enroll as scheduled for any academic period as a full-time student, the student's latest known permanent and temporary addresses, and other information which the school may decide is necessary to identify or locate the student. If the school does not know the identity of the current holder of the HEAL loan, it must notify the HEAL Program Office of a change in the student's enrollment status. This notification is not required for vacation periods and leaves of absence or other temporary interruptions which do not exceed one academic term.</P>

              <P>(2) In the event that the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretary will send a written denial, by certified mail, to the school setting forth the reasons for denial. If a hearing is denied, or if as a result of the hearing, termination is still determined to be necessary, the school will be terminated from participation in the program.

              <SUBJECT>Responsibilities of a HEAL school.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A HEAL school is required to carry out the following activities for each HEAL applicant or borrower:</P>

              <P>(1) Conduct and document an entrance interview with each student (individually or in groups) no later than prior to the loan recipient's first HEAL disbursement in each academic year that the loan recipient obtains a HEAL loan. The school must inform the loan recipient during the entrance interview of his or her rights and responsibilities under a HEAL loan, including the consequences for noncompliance with those responsibilities, and must gather <PRTPAGE P="35"/>personal information which would assist in locating the loan recipient should he or she depart from the school without receiving an exit interview. A school may meet this requirement through correspondence where the school determines that a face-to-face meeting is impracticable.</P>

              <P>(2) Conduct and document an exit interview with each HEAL loan recipient (individually or in groups) within the final academic term of the loan recipient's enrollment prior to his or her anticipated graduation date or other departure date from the school. The school must inform the loan recipient in the exit interview of his or her rights and responsibilities under each HEAL loan, including the consequences for noncompliance with those responsibilities. The school must also collect personal information from the loan recipient which would assist the school or the lender or holder in skiptracing activities and to direct the loan recipient to contact the lender or holder concerning specific repayment terms and options. A copy of the documentation of the exit interview, including the personal information collected for skiptracing activities, and any other information required by the Secretary regarding the exit interview must be sent to the lender or holder of each HEAL loan within 30 days of the exit interview. If the loan recipient departs from the school prior to the anticipated date or does not receive an exit interview, the exit interview information must be mailed to the loan recipient by the school within 30 days of the school's knowledge of the departure or the anticipated departure date, whichever is earlier. The school must request that the loan recipient forward any required information (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> skiptracing information, request for deferment, etc.) to the lender or holder. The school must notify the lender or holder of the loan recipient's departure at the same time it mails the exit interview material to the loan recipient.</P>
              <P>(3) Verify the accuracy and completeness of information provided by each student on the HEAL loan application, particularly in regard to the HEAL eligibility requirements, by comparing the information with previous loan applications or other records or information provided by the student to the school. Notify the potential lender of any discrepancies which were not resolved between the school and the student.</P>
              <P>(4) Develop and implement procedures relating to check receipt and release which keep these functions separate from the application preparation and approval process and assure that the amount of the HEAL loan check(s) does(do) not exceed the approved total amount of the loan and the statutory maximums. Checks must not be cashed without the borrower's personal endorsement. Documentation of these procedures and their usage shall be maintained by the school.</P>
              <P>(5) Maintain accurate and complete records on each HEAL borrower and related school activities required by the HEAL program. All HEAL records shall be properly safeguarded and protected from environmental threats and unauthorized intrusion for use and theft.</P>
              <P>(6) Maintain documentation of the criteria used to develop the school's standard student budgets in the school's general records, readily available for audit purposes, and maintain in each HEAL borrower's record a copy of the standard budget which was actually used in the determination of the maximum loan amount approvable for the student, as described in § 681.51.</P>
              <P>(7) Notify the lender or its assignee of any changes in the student's name, address, status, or other information pertinent to the HEAL loan not more than 30 days after receiving information indicating such a change.</P>
              <P>(b) Any school which has information which indicates potential or actual commission of fraud or other offenses against the United States involving these loan funds must promptly provide this information to the appropriate Regional Office of Inspector General for Investigations.</P>

              <P>(c) The school will be considered responsible and the Secretary may seek reimbursement from any school for the amount of a loan in default on which the Secretary has paid an insurance claim, if the Secretary finds that the school did not comply with the applicable HEAL statute and regulations, or <PRTPAGE P="36"/>its written agreement with the Secretary. The Secretary may excuse certain defects if the school satisfies the Secretary that the defect did not contribute to the default or prejudice the Secretary's attempt to collect the loan from the borrower.</P>
              <P>(d) A school is authorized to withhold services from a HEAL borrower who is in default on a HEAL loan received while enrolled in that school, except in instances where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. Such services may include, but are not limited to academic transcripts and alumni services. Defaulted HEAL borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy shall provide court documentation that verifies the filing for bankruptcy upon the request of the school. Schools will also supply this information to the Secretary upon request. All academic and financial aid transcripts that are released on a defaulted HEAL borrower must indicate on the transcript that the borrower is in default on a HEAL loan. It is the responsibility of the borrower to provide the school with documentation from the lender, holder, or Department when a default has been satisfactorily resolved, in order to obtain access to services that are being withheld, or to have the reference to default removed from the academic and financial aid transcripts.</P>

              <SUBJECT>The Federal Family Education Loan programs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part governs the following four programs collectively referred to in these regulations as “the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs,” in which lenders used their own funds prior to July 1, 2010, to make loans to enable a student or his or her parents to pay the costs of the student's attendance at postsecondary schools.</P>
              <P>(1) The Federal Stafford Loan (Stafford) Program, which encouraged making loans to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.</P>
              <P>(2) The Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Program, as in effect for periods of enrollment that began prior to July 1, 1994, which encouraged making loans to graduate, professional, independent undergraduate, and certain dependent undergraduate students.</P>
              <P>(3) The Federal PLUS (PLUS) Program, which encouraged making loans to parents of dependent undergraduate students. Before October 17, 1986, the PLUS Program also provided for making loans to graduate, professional, and independent undergraduate students. Before July 1, 1993, the PLUS Program also provided for making loans to parents of dependent graduate students. The PLUS Program also provided for making loans to graduate and professional students on or after July 1, 2006 and prior to July 1, 2010.</P>

              <P>(4) The Federal Consolidation Loan Program (Consolidation Loan Program), which encouraged making loans to borrowers for the purpose of consolidating loans: under the Federal Insured Student Loan (FISL), Stafford loan, SLS, ALAS (as in effect before October 17, 1986), PLUS, Perkins Loan programs, the Health Professions Student <PRTPAGE P="38"/>Loan (HPSL) including Loans for Disadvantaged Students (LDS) Program authorized by subpart II of part A of Title VII of the Public Health Services Act, Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) authorized by subpart I of Part A of Title VII of the Health Services Act, Nursing Student Loan Program loans authorized by subpart II of part B of title VIII of the Public Health Service Act, and existing loans obtained under the Consolidation Loan Program, and William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) program loans, if the application for the Consolidation loan was received on or after November 13, 1997 and prior to July 1, 2010.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Except for the loans guaranteed directly by the Secretary described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a guaranty agency guarantees a lender against losses due to default by the borrower on a FFEL loan. If the guaranty agency meets certain Federal requirements, the guaranty agency is reimbursed by the Secretary for all or part of the amount of default claims it pays to lenders.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) The Secretary guarantees lenders against losses—</P>
              <P>(A) Within the Stafford Loan Program, on loans made under Federal Insured Student Loan (FISL) Program;</P>
              <P>(B) Within the PLUS Program, on loans made under the Federal PLUS Program;</P>
              <P>(C) Within the SLS Program, on loans made under the Federal SLS Program as in effect for periods of enrollment that began prior to July 1, 1994; and</P>
              <P>(D) Within the Consolidation Loan Program, on loans made under the Federal Consolidation Loan Program.</P>
              <P>(ii) The loan programs listed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section collectively are referred to in these regulations as the “Federal Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) programs.”</P>
              <P>(iii) The Federal GSL programs were authorized to operate in States not served by a guaranty agency program. In addition, the FISL and Federal SLS (as in effect for periods of enrollment that began prior to July 1, 1994) programs were authorized, under limited circumstances, to operate in States in which a guaranty agency program did not serve all eligible students.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Repaying a loan.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Generally, the borrower is obligated to repay the full amount of the loan, late fees, collection costs chargeable to the borrower, and any interest not payable by the Secretary. <PRTPAGE P="39"/>The borrower's obligation to repay is cancelled if the borrower dies, becomes totally and permanently disabled, or has that obligation discharged in bankruptcy. A parent borrower's obligation to repay a PLUS loan is cancelled if the student, on whose behalf the parent borrowed, dies. The borrower's or student's obligation to repay all or a portion of his or her loan may be cancelled if the student is unable to complete his or her program of study because the school closed or the borrower's or student's eligibility to borrow was falsely certified by the school. The obligation to repay all or a portion of a loan may be forgiven for Stafford Loan borrowers who enter certain areas of the teaching profession.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Stafford loan repayment.</E> In the case of a subsidized Stafford loan, a borrower is not required to make any principal payments during the time the borrower is in school. The Secretary pays the interest on the borrower's behalf during the time the borrower is in school. When the borrower ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a grace period begins during which no principal payments are required, and the Secretary continues to make interest payments on the borrower's behalf. In the case of an unsubsidized Stafford loan, the borrower is responsible for interest during these periods. At the end of the grace period, the repayment period begins. During the repayment period, for the subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loan, the borrower pays both the principal and the interest accruing on the loan.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">SLS loan repayment.</E> Generally, the repayment period for an SLS loan begins immediately on the day of the last disbursement of the loan proceeds by the lender. The first payment of principal and interest on an SLS loan is due from the borrower within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed unless a borrower who is also a Stafford loan borrower, but who has not yet entered repayment on the Stafford loan, requests that commencement of repayment on the SLS loan be deferred until the borrower's grace period on the Stafford loan expires.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">PLUS loan repayment.</E> Generally, the repayment period for a PLUS loan begins on the day the loan is fully disbursed by the lender. The first payment of principal and interest on a PLUS loan is due from the borrower within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Consolidation loan repayment.</E> Generally, the repayment period for a Consolidation loan begins on the day the loan is disbursed. The first payment of principal and interest on a Consolidation loan is due from the borrower within 60 days after the borrower's liability on all loans being consolidated has been discharged.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Deferment of repayment.</E> Repayment of principal on a FFEL program loan may be deferred under the circumstances described in § 682.210.</P>

              <P>(a) The loan servicing process includes reporting to nationwide consumer reporting agencies, responding to borrower inquiries, establishing the terms of repayment, and reporting a borrower's enrollment and loan status information.</P>

              <P>(i) The total amount of FFEL loans the lender has made to the borrower, within 90 days of each disbursement;</P>
              <P>(ii) The outstanding balance of the loans;<PRTPAGE P="67"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Information concerning the repayment status of the loan, no less frequently than every 90 days or quarterly after a change in that status from current to delinquent;</P>
              <P>(iv) The date the loan is fully repaid by, or on behalf of, the borrower, or discharged by reason of the borrower's death, bankruptcy, or total and permanent disability, within 90 days after that date;</P>
              <P>(v) Other information required by law to be reported.</P>
              <P>(2) An eligible lender that has acquired a FFEL loan shall report to each nationwide consumer reporting agency the information required by paragraph (b)(1)(ii)-(v) of this section within 90 days of its acquisition of the loan.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon receipt of a valid identity theft report as defined in section 603(q)(4) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a) or notification from a consumer reporting agency that information furnished by the lender is a result of an alleged identity theft as defined in § 682.402(e)(14), an eligible lender shall suspend consumer reporting agency reporting for a period not to exceed 120 days while the lender determines the enforceability of a loan.</P>
              <P>(i) If the lender determines that a loan does not qualify for a discharge under § 682.402(e)(1)(i)(C), but is nonetheless unenforceable, the lender must—</P>
              <P>(A) Notify the consumer reporting agency of its determination; and</P>
              <P>(B) Comply with §§ 682.300(b)(2)(ix) and 682.302(d)(1)(viii).</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(4) If, within 3 years of the lender's receipt of an identity theft report, the lender receives from the borrower evidence specified in § 682.402(e)(3)(v), the lender may submit a claim and receive interest subsidy and special allowance payments that would have accrued on the loan.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) A lender shall respond within 30 days after receipt to any inquiry from a borrower or any endorser on a loan.</P>
              <P>(2) When a lender learns that a Stafford loan borrower or a student PLUS loan borrower is no longer enrolled at an institution of higher education on at least a half-time basis, the lender shall promptly contact the borrower in order to establish the terms of repayment.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) If the borrower disputes the terms of the loan in writing and the lender does not resolve the dispute, the lender's response must provide the borrower with an appropriate contact at the guaranty agency for the resolution of the dispute.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the guaranty agency does not resolve the dispute, the agency's response must provide the borrower with information on the availability of the Student Loan Ombudsman's office.</P>
              <P>(d) Subject to the rules regarding maximum duration of a repayment period and minimum annual payment described in § 682.209(a)(7), (c), and (h), nothing in this part is intended to limit a lender's discretion in establishing, or, with the borrower's consent, revising a borrower's repayment schedule—</P>
              <P>(1) To provide for graduated or income-sensitive repayment terms. The Secretary strongly encourages lenders to provide a graduated or income-sensitive repayment schedule to a borrower providing for at least the payment of interest charges, unless the borrower requests otherwise, in order to make the borrower's repayment burden commensurate with his or her projected ability to pay; or</P>
              <P>(2) To provide a single repayment schedule, as authorized and if practicable, for all FFEL program loans to the borrower held by the lender.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) If the assignment or transfer of ownership interest of a Stafford, PLUS, SLS, or Consolidation loan is to result in a change in the identity of the party to whom the borrower must send subsequent payments, the assignor and assignee of the loan shall, no later than 45 days from the date the assignee acquires a legally enforceable right to receive payment from the borrower on the assigned loan, provide, either jointly or separately, a notice to the borrower of—</P>
              <P>(i) The assignment;</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Conversion of a loan to repayment status.</E> (1) For a Consolidation loan, the repayment period begins on the date the loan is disbursed. The first payment is due within 60 days after the date the loan is disbursed.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) For a PLUS loan, the repayment period begins on the date of the last disbursement made on the loan. Interest accrues and is due and payable from the date of the first disbursement of the loan. The first payment is due within 60 days after the date the loan is fully disbursed.</P>
              <P>(ii) For an SLS loan, the repayment period begins on the date the loan is disbursed, or, if the loan is disbursed in multiple installments, on the date of the last disbursement of the loan. Interest accrues and is due and payable from the date of the first disbursement of the loan. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii), (a)(2)(iv), and (a)(2)(v) of this section the first payment is due within 60 days after the date the loan is fully disbursed.</P>
              <P>(iii) For an SLS borrower who has not yet entered repayment on a Stafford loan, the borrower may postpone payment, consistent with the grace period on the borrower's Stafford loan.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the lender first learns after the fact that an SLS borrower has entered the repayment period, the repayment begins no later than 75 days after the date the lender learns that the borrower has entered the repayment period.</P>
              <P>(v) The lender may establish a first payment due date that is no more than an additional 30 days beyond the period specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)-(a)(2)(iv) of this section in order for the lender to comply with the required deadline contained in § 682.205(c)(1).</P>

              <P>(A) For a borrower with a loan for which the applicable interest rate is 7 percent per year, not less than 9 nor more than 12 months following the date on which the borrower is no longer enrolled on at least a half-time basis at an eligible school. The length of this grace period is determined by the lender for loans made under the FISL Program, and by the guaranty agency for loans guaranteed by the agency;</P>
              <P>(B) For a borrower with a loan for which the initial applicable interest rate is 8 or 9 percent per year, the day after 6 months following the date on which the borrower is no longer enrolled on at least a half-time basis at an institution of higher education;</P>

              <P>(B) 60 days from the expiration of a deferment or forbearance period;</P>
              <P>(C) 60 days following the end of the post deferment grace period;</P>

              <P>(D) If the lender first learns after the fact that the borrower has entered the <PRTPAGE P="71"/>repayment period, no later than 75 days after the date the lender learns that the borrower has entered the repayment period; or</P>
              <P>(E) An additional 30 days beyond the periods specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A)-(a)(3)(ii)(D) of this section in order for the lender to comply with the required deadlines contained in § 682.205(a)(1).</P>
              <P>(iii) When determining the date that the student was no longer enrolled on at least a half-time basis, the lender must use a new date it receives from a school, unless the lender has already disclosed repayment terms to the borrower and the new date is within the same month and year as the most recent date reported to the lender.</P>
              <P>(4) For a borrower of a Stafford loan who is a correspondence student, the grace period specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section begins on the earliest of—</P>
              <P>(i) The day after the borrower completes the program;</P>
              <P>(ii) The day after withdrawal as determined pursuant to 34 CFR 668.22; or</P>
              <P>(iii) 60 days following the last day for completing the program as established by the school.</P>

Any single excluded period may not exceed three years and includes the time necessary for the borrower to resume enrollment at the next available regular enrollment period. Any Stafford or SLS borrower who is in a grace period when called or ordered to active duty as specified in this paragraph is entitled to a full grace period upon completion of the excluded period.</P>
              <P>(6)(i) The repayment schedule may provide for substantially equal installment payments or for installment payments that increase or decrease in amount during the repayment period. If the loan has a variable interest rate that changes annually, the lender may establish a repayment schedule that—</P>
              <P>(A) Provides for adjustments of the amount of the installment payment to reflect annual changes in the variable interest rate; or</P>
              <P>(B) Contains no provision for an adjustment of the amount of the installment payment to reflect annual changes in the variable interest rate, but requires the lender to grant a forbearance to the borrower (or endorser, if applicable) for a period of up to 3 years of payments in accordance with § 682.211(i)(5) in cases where the effect of a variable interest rate on a standard or graduated repayment schedule would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment term.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a graduated or income-sensitive repayment schedule is established, it may not provide for any single installment that is more than three times greater than any other installment. An agreement as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is not required if the schedule provides for less than the minimum annual payment amount specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) Not more than six months prior to the date that the borrower's first payment is due, the lender must offer the borrower a choice of a standard, income-sensitive, income-based, graduated, or, if applicable, an extended repayment schedule.</P>
              <P>(iv) Except in the case of an income-based repayment schedule, the repayment schedule must require that each payment equal at least the interest that accrues during the interval between scheduled payments.</P>
              <P>(v) The lender shall require the borrower to repay the loan under a standard repayment schedule described in paragraph (a)(6)(vi) of this section if the borrower—</P>
              <P>(A) Does not select an income-sensitive, income-based, graduated, or, if applicable, an extended repayment schedule within 45 days after being notified by the lender to choose a repayment schedule;</P>

              <P>(B) Chooses an income-sensitive repayment schedule, but does not provide the documentation requested by the lender under paragraph (a)(6)(viii)(C) of <PRTPAGE P="72"/>this section within the time period specified by the lender; or</P>
              <P>(C) Chooses an income-based repayment schedule, but does not provide the income documentation requested by the lender under § 682.215(e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iii) within the time period specified by the lender.</P>
              <P>(vi) Under a standard repayment schedule, the borrower is scheduled to pay either—</P>
              <P>(A) The same amount for each installment payment made during the repayment period, except that the borrower's final payment may be slightly more or less than the other payments; or</P>
              <P>(B) An installment amount that will be adjusted to reflect annual changes in the loan's variable interest rate.</P>
              <P>(vii) Under a graduated repayment schedule—</P>
              <P>(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) The amount of the borrower's installment payment is scheduled to change (usually by increasing) during the course of the repayment period; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the loan has a variable interest rate that changes annually, the lender may establish a repayment schedule that may have adjustments in the payment amount as provided under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(B) An agreement as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is not required if the schedule provides for less than the minimum annual payment amount specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</P>

              <P>(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) The amount of the borrower's installment payment is adjusted annually, based on the borrower's expected total monthly gross income received by the borrower from employment and from other sources during the course of the repayment period; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the loan has a variable interest rate that changes annually, the lender may establish a repayment schedule that may have adjustments in the payment amount as provided under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(B) In general, the lender shall request the borrower to inform the lender of his or her income no earlier than 90 days prior to the due date of the borrower's initial installment payment and subsequent annual payment adjustment under an income-sensitive repayment schedule. The income information must be sufficient for the lender to make a reasonable determination of what the borrower's payment amount should be. If the lender receives late notification that the borrower has dropped below half-time enrollment status at a school, the lender may request that income information earlier than 90 days prior to the due date of the borrower's initial installment payment;</P>
              <P>(C) If the borrower reports income to the lender that the lender considers to be insufficient for establishing monthly installment payments that would repay the loan within the applicable maximum repayment period, the lender shall require the borrower to submit evidence showing the amount of the most recent total monthly gross income received by the borrower from employment and from other sources including, if applicable, pay statements from employers and documentation of any income received by the borrower from other parties;</P>
              <P>(D) The lender shall grant a forbearance to the borrower (or endorser, if applicable) for a period of up to 5 years of payments in accordance with § 682.211(i)(5) in cases where the effect of decreased installment amounts paid under an income-sensitive repayment schedule would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment term; and</P>
              <P>(E) The lender shall inform the borrower that the loan must be repaid within the time limits specified under paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ix) Under an extended repayment schedule, a new borrower whose total outstanding principal and interest in FFEL loans exceed $30,000 may repay the loan on a fixed annual repayment amount or a graduated repayment amount for a period that may not exceed 25 years.

              </P>
              <P>(xi) A borrower may request a change in the repayment schedule on a loan. The lender must permit the borrower to change the repayment schedule no less frequently than annually, or at any time in the case of a borrower in an income-based repayment plan.</P>
              <P>(xii) For purposes of this section, a lender shall, to the extent practicable require that all FFEL loans owed by a borrower to the lender be combined into one account and repaid under one repayment schedule. In that event, the word “loan” in this section shall mean all of the borrower's loans that were combined by the lender into that account.</P>
              <P>(7)(i) Subject to paragraphs (a)(7)(ii) through (iv) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(ix) a lender shall allow a borrower at least 5 years, but not more than 10 years, or 25 years under an extended repayment plan to repay a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan, calculated from the beginning of the repayment period. Except in the case of a FISL loan for a period of enrollment beginning on or after July 1, 1986, the lender shall require a borrower to fully repay a FISL loan within 15 years after it is made.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the borrower receives an authorized deferment or is granted forbearance, as described in § 682.210 or § 682.211 respectively, the periods of deferment or forbearance are excluded from determinations of the 5-, 10-, and 15- and 25-year periods, and from the 10-, 12-, 15-, 20-, 25-, and 30-year periods for repayment of a Consolidation loan pursuant to § 682.209(h).</P>
              <P>(iii) If the minimum annual repayment required in paragraph (c) of this section would result in complete repayment of the loan in less than 5 years, the borrower is not entitled to the full 5-year period.</P>
              <P>(iv) The borrower may, prior to the beginning of the repayment period, request and be granted by the lender a repayment period of less than 5 years. Subject to paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section, a borrower who makes such a request may notify the lender at any time to extend the repayment period to a minimum of 5 years.</P>
              <P>(8) If, with respect to the aggregate of all loans held by a lender, the total payment made by a borrower for a monthly or similar payment period would not otherwise be a multiple of five dollars, except in the case of payments made under an income-based repayment plan, the lender may round that periodic payment to the next highest whole dollar amount that is a multiple of five dollars.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment application and prepayment.</E> (1) Except in the case of payments made under an income-based repayment plan, the lender may credit the entire payment amount first to any late charges accrued or collection costs and then to any outstanding interest and then to outstanding principal.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) The borrower may prepay the whole or any part of a loan at any time without penalty.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the prepayment amount equals or exceeds the monthly payment amount under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the lender shall apply the prepayment to future installments by advancing the next payment due date, unless the borrower requests otherwise. The lender must either inform the borrower in advance using a prominent statement in the borrower's coupon book or billing statement that any additional full payment amounts submitted without instructions to the lender as to their handling will be applied to future scheduled payments with the borrower's next scheduled payment due date advanced consistent with the number of additional payments received, or provide a notification to the borrower after the payments are received informing the borrower that the payments have been so applied and the date of the borrower's next scheduled payment due date. Information related to next scheduled payment due date need not be provided to borrowers making such prepayments while in an in-school, grace, deferment, or forbearance period when payments are not due.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Deferment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1)(i) A borrower is entitled to have periodic installment payments of principal deferred during authorized periods after the beginning of the repayment period, pursuant to paragraph (b) and paragraphs (s) through (v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) With the exception of a deferment authorized under paragraph (o) of this section, a borrower may continue to receive a specific type of deferment that is limited to a maximum period of time only if the total amount of time that the borrower has received the deferment does not exceed the maximum time period allowed for the deferment.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) For a loan made before October 1, 1981, the borrower is also entitled to have periodic installments of principal deferred during the six-month period (post-deferment grace period) that begins after the completion of each deferment period or combination of those periods, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Once a borrower receives a post-deferment grace period following an unemployment deferment, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, the borrower does not qualify for additional post-deferment grace periods following subsequent unemployment deferments.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Interest accrues and is paid by—</P>
              <P>(A) The Secretary during the deferment period for a subsidized Stafford loan and for all or a portion of a Consolidation loan that qualifies for interest benefits under § 682.301; or</P>
              <P>(B) The borrower during the deferment period and, as applicable, the post-deferment grace period, on all other loans.</P>
              <P>(ii) A borrower who is responsible for payment of interest during a deferment period must be notified by the lender, at or before the time the deferment is granted, that the borrower has the option to pay the accruing interest or cancel the deferment and continue paying on the loan. The lender must also provide information, including an example, on the impact of capitalization of accrued, unpaid interest on loan principal, and on the total amount of interest to be paid over the life of the loan.</P>
              <P>(4) As a condition for receiving a deferment, except for purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section, the borrower, or the borrower's representative for purposes of paragraphs (i) and (t) of this section, must request the deferment, and provide the lender with all information and documents required to establish eligibility for a specific type of deferment.</P>
              <P>(5) An authorized deferment period begins on the date that the holder determines is the date that the condition entitling the borrower to the deferment first existed, except that an initial unemployment deferment as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section cannot begin more than 6 months before the date the holder receives a request and documentation required for the deferment.</P>
              <P>(6) An authorized deferment period ends on the earlier of—</P>

              <P>(i) The date when the condition establishing the borrower's eligibility for the deferment ends;<PRTPAGE P="76"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section, the date on which, as certified by an authorized official, the borrower's eligibility for the deferment is expected to end;</P>
              <P>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section, the expiration date of the period covered by any certification required by this section to be obtained for the deferment;</P>
              <P>(iv) In the case of an in-school deferment, the student's anticipated graduation date as certified by an authorized official of the school; or</P>
              <P>(v) The date when the condition providing the basis for the borrower's eligibility for the deferment has continued to exist for the maximum amount of time allowed for that type of deferment.</P>
              <P>(7) A lender may not deny a borrower a deferment to which the borrower is entitled, even though the borrower may be delinquent, but not in default, in making required installment payments. The 270- or 330-day period required to establish default does not run during the deferment and post-deferment grace periods. Unless the lender has granted the borrower forbearance under § 682.211, when the deferment and, if applicable, the post-deferment grace period expire, a borrower resumes any delinquency status that existed when the deferment period began.</P>
              <P>(8) A borrower whose loan is in default is not eligible for a deferment on that loan, unless the borrower has made payment arrangements acceptable to the lender prior to the payment of a default claim by a guaranty agency.</P>
              <P>(9) The borrower promptly must inform the lender when the condition entitling the borrower to a deferment no longer exists.</P>
              <P>(10) Authorized deferments are described in paragraph (b) of this section. Specific requirements for each deferment are set forth in paragraphs (c) through (s) of this section.</P>
              <P>(11) If two individuals are jointly liable for repayment of a PLUS loan or a Consolidation loan, the lender shall grant a request for deferment if both individuals simultaneously meet the requirements of this section for receiving the same, or different deferments.</P>

              <P>(2) The lender is not required to notify the borrower (or endorser, if applicable) at the time the forbearance is granted, but shall grant a forbearance to a borrower or endorser during a period, and the 30 days following the period, when the lender is notified by the Secretary that—</P>
              <P>(i) Exceptional circumstances exist, such as a local or national emergency or military mobilization; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The geographical area in which the borrower or endorser resides has been designated a disaster area by the president of the United States or Mexico, the Prime Minister of Canada, or by a Governor of a State.</P>

              <P>(3) As soon as feasible, or by the date specified by the Secretary, the lender shall notify the borrower (or endorser, <PRTPAGE P="92"/>if applicable) that the lender has granted a forbearance and the date that payments should resume. The lender's notification shall state that the borrower or endorser—</P>
              <P>(i) May decline the forbearance and continue to be obligated to make scheduled payments; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Consents to making payments in accordance with the lender's notification if the forbearance is not declined.</P>
              <P>(4) For purposes of paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section, the term “military mobilization” shall mean a situation in which the Department of Defense orders members of the National Guard or Reserves to active duty under sections 688, 12301(a), 12301(g), 12302, 12304, and 12306 of title 10, United States Code. This term also includes the assignment of other members of the Armed Forces to duty stations at locations other than the locations at which they were normally assigned, only if the military mobilization involved the activation of the National Guard or Reserves.</P>
              <P>(5) The lender shall grant a mandatory administrative forbearance to a borrower (or endorser, if applicable) during a period when the borrower (or endorser, if applicable) is making payments for a period of—</P>
              <P>(i) Up to 3 years of payments in cases where the effect of a variable interest rate on a standard or graduated repayment schedule would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment term; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Up to 5 years of payments in cases where the effect of decreased installment amounts paid under an income-sensitive repayment schedule would result in the loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment term.</P>
              <P>(6) The lender shall grant a mandatory administrative forbearance to a borrower for a period not to exceed 60 days after the lender receives reliable information indicating that the borrower (or student in the case of a PLUS loan) has died, until the lender receives documentation of death pursuant to § 682.402(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(7) The lender must grant a mandatory administrative forbearance to a borrower upon being notified by the Secretary that the borrower has made a borrower defense claim related to a loan that the borrower intends to consolidate into the Direct Loan Program for the purpose of seeking relief in accordance with § 685.212(k). The mandatory administrative forbearance shall be granted in yearly increments or for a period designated by the Secretary until the loan is consolidated or until the lender is notified by the Secretary to discontinue the forbearance.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this section—</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Adjusted gross income</E> (AGI) means the borrower's adjusted gross income as reported to the Internal Revenue Service. For a married borrower filing jointly, AGI includes both the borrower's and spouse's income. For a married borrower filing separately, AGI includes only the borrower's income.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Eligible loan</E> means any outstanding loan made to a borrower under the FFEL and Direct Loan programs except for a defaulted loan, a FFEL or Direct PLUS Loan made to a parent borrower, or a FFEL or Direct Consolidation Loan that repaid a FFEL or Direct PLUS Loan made to a parent borrower.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Family size</E> means the number that is determined by counting the borrower, the borrower's spouse, and the borrower's children, including unborn children who will be born during the year the borrower certifies family size, <PRTPAGE P="94"/>if the children receive more than half their support from the borrower. A borrower's family size includes other individuals if, at the time the borrower certifies family size, the other individuals—</P>
              <P>(i) Live with the borrower; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Receive more than half their support from the borrower and will continue to receive this support from the borrower for the year the borrower certifies family size. Support includes money, gifts, loans, housing, food, clothes, car, medical and dental care, and payment of college costs.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Partial financial hardship</E> means a circumstance in which—</P>
              <P>(i) For an unmarried borrower or a married borrower who files an individual Federal tax return, the annual amount due on all of the borrower's eligible loans, as calculated under a standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period, using the greater of the amount due at the time the borrower initially entered repayment or at the time the borrower elects the income-based repayment plan, exceeds 15 percent of the difference between the borrower's AGI and 150 percent of the poverty guideline for the borrower's family size; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For a married borrower who files a joint Federal tax return with his or her spouse, the annual amount due on all of the borrower's eligible loans and, if applicable, the spouse's eligible loans, as calculated under a standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period, using the greater of the amount due at the time the loans initially entered repayment or at the time the borrower or spouse elects the income-based repayment plan, exceeds 15 percent of the difference between the borrower's and spouse's AGI, and 150 percent of the poverty guideline for the borrower's family size.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Poverty guideline</E> refers to the income categorized by State and family size in the poverty guidelines published annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902(2). If a borrower is not a resident of a State identified in the poverty guidelines, the poverty guideline to be used for the borrower is the poverty guideline (for the relevant family size) used for the 48 contiguous States.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Repayment plan.</E> (1) A borrower may elect the income-based repayment plan only if the borrower has a partial financial hardship. The borrower's aggregate monthly loan payments are limited to no more than 15 percent of the amount by which the borrower's AGI exceeds 150 percent of the poverty line income applicable to the borrower's family size, divided by 12. The loan holder adjusts the calculated monthly payment if—</P>
              <P>(i) Except for borrowers provided for in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the total amount of the borrower's eligible loans includes loans not held by the loan holder, in which case the loan holder determines the borrower's adjusted monthly payment by multiplying the calculated payment by the percentage of the total outstanding principal amount of the borrower's eligible loans that are held by the loan holder;</P>
              <P>(ii) Both the borrower and the borrower's spouse have eligible loans and filed a joint Federal tax return, in which case the loan holder determines—</P>
              <P>(A) Each borrower's percentage of the couple's total eligible loan debt;</P>
              <P>(B) The adjusted monthly payment for each borrower by multiplying the calculated payment by the percentage determined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(C) If the borrower's loans are held by multiple holders, the borrower's adjusted monthly payment by multiplying the payment determined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section by the percentage of the total outstanding principal amount of the borrower's eligible loans that are held by the loan holder;</P>
              <P>(iii) The calculated amount under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(1)(i), or (b)(1)(ii) of this section is less than $5.00, in which case the borrower's monthly payment is $0.00; or</P>

              <P>(iv) The calculated amount under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(1)(i), or (b)(1)(ii) of this section is equal to or greater than $5.00 but less than $10.00, in which case the borrower's monthly payment is $10.00.<PRTPAGE P="95"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) A borrower with eligible loans held by two or more loan holders must request income-based repayment from each loan holder if the borrower wants to repay all of his or her eligible loans under the income-based repayment plan. Each loan holder must apply the payment calculation rules in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section to loans they hold.</P>
              <P>(3) If a borrower elects the income-based repayment plan on or after July 1, 2013, the loan holder must, unless the borrower has some loans that are eligible for repayment under the income-based repayment plan and other loans that are not eligible for repayment under that plan, require that all eligible loans owed by the borrower to that holder be repaid under the income-based repayment plan.</P>
              <P>(4) If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay the accrued interest on the borrower's subsidized Stafford Loans or the subsidized portion of the borrower's Federal Consolidation loan, the Secretary pays to the holder the remaining accrued interest for a period not to exceed three consecutive years from the established repayment period start date on each loan repaid under the income-based repayment plan. On a Consolidation Loan that repays loans on which the Secretary has paid accrued interest under this section, the three-year period includes the period for which the Secretary paid accrued interest on the underlying loans. The three-year period does not include any period during which the borrower receives an economic hardship deferment.</P>
              <P>(5) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, accrued interest is capitalized at the time the borrower chooses to leave the income-based repayment plan or no longer has a partial financial hardship.</P>
              <P>(6) If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay any principal due, the payment of that principal is postponed until the borrower chooses to leave the income-based repayment plan or no longer has a partial financial hardship.</P>
              <P>(7) The special allowance payment to a lender during the period in which the borrower has a partial financial hardship under the income-based repayment plan is calculated on the principal balance of the loan and any accrued interest unpaid by the borrower.</P>
              <P>(8) The repayment period for a borrower under the income-based repayment plan may be greater than 10 years.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment application and prepayment.</E> (1) The loan holder shall apply any payment made under the income-based repayment plan in the following order:</P>
              <P>(i) Accrued interest.</P>
              <P>(ii) Collection costs.</P>
              <P>(iii) Late charges.</P>
              <P>(iv) Loan principal.</P>
              <P>(2) The borrower may prepay the whole or any part of a loan at any time without penalty.</P>
              <P>(3) If the prepayment amount equals or exceeds a monthly payment amount of $10.00 or more under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the loan holder shall apply the prepayment consistent with the requirements of § 682.209(b)(2)(ii).</P>
              <P>(4) If the prepayment amount exceeds the monthly payment amount of $0.00 under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the loan holder shall apply the prepayment consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Changes in the payment amount.</E> (1) If a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship, the borrower may continue to make payments under the income-based repayment plan but the loan holder must recalculate the borrower's monthly payment. The loan holder also recalculates the monthly payment for a borrower who chooses to stop making income-based payments. In either case, as a result of the recalculation—</P>

              <P>(i) The maximum monthly amount that the loan holder requires the borrower to repay is the amount the borrower would have paid under the FFEL standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period using the amount of the borrower's eligible loans that was outstanding at the time the borrower began repayment on the loans with that holder under the income-based repayment plan; and<PRTPAGE P="96"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The borrower's repayment period based on the recalculated payment amount may exceed 10 years.</P>
              <P>(2) If a borrower no longer wishes to pay under the income-based repayment plan, the borrower must pay under the FFEL standard repayment plan and the loan holder recalculates the borrower's monthly payment based on—</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the time remaining under the maximum 10-year repayment period and the amount of the borrower's loans that was outstanding at the time the borrower discontinued paying under the income-based repayment plan; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For a Consolidation Loan, the time remaining under the applicable repayment period as initially determined under § 682.209(h)(2) and the total amount of that loan that was outstanding at the time the borrower discontinued paying under the income-based repayment plan.</P>
              <P>(3) A borrower who no longer wishes to repay under the income-based repayment plan and who is required to repay under the FFEL standard repayment plan in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section may request a change to a different repayment plan after making one monthly payment under the FFEL standard repayment plan. For this purpose, a monthly payment may include one payment made under a forbearance that provides for temporarily accepting smaller payments than previously scheduled, in accordance with § 682.211(a)(1).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Eligibility documentation, verification, and notifications.</E> (1) The loan holder determines whether a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the income-based repayment plan for the year the borrower elects the plan and for each subsequent year that the borrower remains on the plan. To make this determination, the loan holder requires the borrower to—</P>
              <P>(i) Provide documentation, acceptable to the loan holder, of the borrower's AGI;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the borrower's AGI is not available, or the loan holder believes that the borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current income, provide other documentation to verify income;</P>
              <P>(iii) If the spouse of a married borrower who files a joint Federal tax return has eligible loans and the loan holder does not hold at least one of the spouse's eligible loans—</P>
              <P>(A) Ensure that the borrower's spouse has provided consent for the loan holder to obtain information about the spouse's eligible loans from the National Student Loan Data System; or</P>
              <P>(B) Provide other documentation, acceptable to the loan holder, of the spouse's eligible loan information; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Annually certify the borrower's family size. If the borrower fails to certify family size, the loan holder must assume a family size of one for that year.</P>
              <P>(2) After making a determination that a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the income-based repayment plan for the year the borrower initially elects the plan and for any subsequent year that the borrower has a partial financial hardship, the loan holder must send the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with—</P>
              <P>(i) The borrower's scheduled monthly payment amount, as calculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and the time period during which this scheduled monthly payment amount will apply (annual payment period);</P>
              <P>(ii) Information about the requirement for the borrower to annually provide the information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if the borrower chooses to remain on the income-based repayment plan after the initial year on the plan, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified in advance of the date by which the loan holder must receive this information;</P>
              <P>(iii) An explanation of the consequences, as described in paragraphs (e)(1)(iv) and (e)(7) of this section, if the borrower does not provide the required information;</P>
              <P>(iv) An explanation of the consequences if the borrower no longer wishes to repay under the income-based repayment plan; and</P>

              <P>(v) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time during the borrower's current annual payment period, that the loan holder recalculate the borrower's monthly payment <PRTPAGE P="97"/>amount if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount that was used to calculate the borrower's current monthly payment no longer reflects the borrower's current income. If the loan holder recalculates the borrower's monthly payment amount based on the borrower's request, the loan holder must send the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) For each subsequent year that a borrower who currently has a partial financial hardship remains on the income-based repayment plan, the loan holder must notify the borrower in writing of the requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section no later than 60 days and no earlier than 90 days prior to the date specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. The notification must provide the borrower with—</P>
              <P>(i) The date, no earlier than 35 days before the end of the borrower's annual payment period, by which the loan holder must receive all of the information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (annual deadline); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The consequences if the loan holder does not receive the information within 10 days following the annual deadline specified in the notice, including the borrower's new monthly payment amount as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the effective date for the recalculated monthly payment amount, and the fact that unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized at the end of the borrower's current annual payment period in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Each time a loan holder makes a determination that a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship for a subsequent year that the borrower wishes to remain on the plan, the loan holder must send the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with—</P>
              <P>(i) The borrower's recalculated monthly payment amount, as determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) An explanation that unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time, that the loan holder redetermine whether the borrower has a partial financial hardship, if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount used to determine that the borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship does not reflect the borrower's current income, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified annually of this option.

              <SUBJECT>Methods for computing interest benefits and special allowance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Secretary pays a lender interest benefits and special allowance on eligible loans on a quarterly basis. These calendar quarters end on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year. A lender may use either the average daily balance method or the actual accrual method to determine the amount of interest benefits payable on a lender's loans. A lender shall use the average daily balance method to determine the balance on which the Secretary computes the amount of special allowance payable on its loans.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Average daily balance method for interest benefits.</E> (1) Under this method, the lender adds the unpaid principal balance outstanding on all loans qualifying for interest benefits at each actual interest rate for each day of the quarter, divides the sum by the number of days in the quarter, and rounds the result to the nearest whole dollar. The resulting figure is the average daily balance for qualified loans outstanding at each actual interest rate.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary computes the interest benefits due on all qualified loans at each actual interest rate by multiplying the average daily balance thereof by the actual interest rate, multiplying this result by the number of days in the quarter, and then dividing this result by the actual number of days in the year.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Actual accrual method for interest benefits.</E> (1) Under this method, the lender computes the total unpaid principal balance outstanding on all qualified loans at each actual interest rate on each day of the quarter, multiplies this result by the actual interest rate, and divides this result by the actual number of days in the year, or, alternatively, 365.25 days. A lender who chooses to divide by 365.25 days must do so for four consecutive years.</P>
              <P>(2) The interest benefits due for a quarter equal the sum of the daily interest benefits due, computed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for each day of the quarter.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Average daily balance method for special allowance.</E> (1) To compute the average daily balance outstanding for purposes of special allowance, the lender adds the unpaid principal balance outstanding on all qualified loans at each applicable interest rate for each day of the quarter, divides this sum by the number of days in the quarter, and rounds the result to the nearest whole dollar. The resulting figure is the average daily balance for the quarter for qualifying loans at each applicable interest rate.</P>
              <P>(2) To compute the average daily balance of unpaid accrued interest for purposes of special allowance on loans covered by § 682.215(b)(7), the lender adds the unpaid accrued interest on such loans for each eligible day of the quarter, divides this sum by the number of days in the quarter, and rounds the result to the nearest whole dollar. The resulting figure is the average daily balance for the quarter for qualifying loans at the applicable interest rate.</P>
              <P>(3) The Secretary computes the special allowance payable to a lender based upon the average daily balance computed by the lender under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for payment of interest benefits and special allowance and collection of origination and loan fees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) If a lender owes origination fees or loan fees under paragraph (a) of this section, it must submit quarterly reports to the Secretary on a form provided or prescribed by the Secretary, even if the lender is not <PRTPAGE P="116"/>owed, or does not wish to receive, interest benefits or special allowance from the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(2) The lender shall report, on the quarterly report required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amount of origination fees it was authorized to collect and the amount of those fees refunded to borrowers during the quarter covered by the report.</P>
              <P>(3)(i)(A) The Secretary reduces the amount of interest benefits and special allowance payable to the lender by—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The amount of origination fees the lender was authorized to collect during the quarter under § 682.202(c), whether or not the lender actually collected that amount; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The amount of lender fees payable under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The amount of excess interest, as calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) The Secretary increases the amount of interest benefits and special allowance payable to the lender by the amount of origination fees refunded to borrowers during the quarter under § 682.202(c).</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) For any FFEL loan made on or after October 1, 1993, a lender shall pay the Secretary a loan fee equal to 0.50% of the principal amount of the loan.</P>
              <P>(B) For any FFEL loan made on or after October 1, 2007 and prior to July 1, 2010, a lender shall pay the Secretary a loan fee equal to 1.0 percent of the principal amount of the loan.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Secretary collects from an originating lender the amount of origination fees the originating lender was authorized to collect from borrowers during the quarter whether or not the originating lender actually collected those fees. The Secretary also collects the fees the originating lender is required to pay under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section. Generally, the Secretary collects the fees from the originating lender by offsetting the amount of interest benefits and special allowance payable to the originating lender in a quarter, and, if necessary, the amount of interest benefits and special allowance payable in subsequent quarters may be offset until the total amount of fees has been recovered.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the full amount of the fees cannot be collected within two quarters by reducing interest and special allowance payable to the originating lender, the Secretary may collect the unpaid amount directly from the originating lender.</P>
              <P>(v) If the full amount of the fees cannot be collected within two quarters from the originating lender in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section and if the originating lender has transferred the loan to a subsequent holder, the Secretary may, following written notice, collect the unpaid amount from the holder by using the same steps described in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section, with the term “holder” substituting for the term “originating lender”.</P>
              <P>(4) If an originating lender sells or otherwise transfers a loan to a new holder, the originating lender remains liable to the Secretary for payment of the origination fees. The Secretary will not pay interest benefits or special allowance to the new holder or pay reinsurance to the guaranty agency until the origination fees are paid to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Penalty interest.</E> (1)(i) If the Secretary does not pay interest benefits or the special allowance within 30 days after the Secretary receives an accurate, timely, and complete request for payment from a lender, the Secretary pays the lender penalty interest.</P>
              <P>(ii) The payment of interest benefits or special allowance is deemed to occur, for purposes of this paragraph, when the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(A) Authorizes the Treasury Department to pay the lender;</P>
              <P>(B) Credits the payment due the lender against a debt that the Secretary determines is owed the Secretary by the lender; or</P>
              <P>(C) Authorizes the Treasury Department to pay the amount due by the lender to another Federal agency for credit against a debt that the Federal agency has determined the lender owes.</P>

              <P>(2) Penalty interest is an amount that accrues daily on interest benefits and special allowance due to the lender. The penalty interest is computed by—<PRTPAGE P="117"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Multiplying the daily interest rate applicable to loans on which payment for interest benefits was requested, by the amount of interest benefits due on those loans for each interest rate;</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiplying the daily special allowance rate applicable to loans on which special allowance was requested by the amount of special allowance due on those loans for each interest rate and special allowance category;</P>
              <P>(iii) Adding the results of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section to determine the gross penalty interest to be paid for each day that penalty interest is due;</P>
              <P>(iv) Dividing the results of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section by the gross amount of interest benefits and special allowance due to obtain the average penalty interest rate;</P>
              <P>(v) Multiplying the rate obtained in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section by the total amount of reduction to gross interest benefits and special allowance due (e.g., origination fees or other debts owed to the Federal Government);</P>
              <P>(vi) Subtracting the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section from the amount calculated under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section to obtain the net amount of penalty interest due per day; and</P>
              <P>(vii) Multiplying the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section by the number of days calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The Secretary pays penalty interest for the period—</P>
              <P>(i) Beginning on the later of—</P>
              <P>(A) The 31st day after the final day of the quarter covered by the request for payment; or</P>
              <P>(B) The 31st day after the Secretary's receipt of an accurate, timely, and complete request for payment from the lender; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Ending on the day the Secretary pays the interest benefits and the special allowance at issue, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) A request for interest benefits and special allowance is considered timely only if it is received by the Secretary within 90 days following the end of the quarter to which the request pertains.</P>
              <P>(5) A request for interest benefits and special allowance is not considered accurate and complete if it—</P>
              <P>(i) Requests payments to which the lender is not entitled under §§ 682.300 through 682.302;</P>
              <P>(ii) Includes loans that the Secretary, in writing, has directed that the lender exclude from the request;</P>
              <P>(iii) Does not contain all information required by the Secretary or contains conflicting information; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Is not provided and certified on the form and in the manner prescribed by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Independent audits.</E> (1)(i) A lender holding more than $5 million in FFEL loans during its fiscal year must submit an independent annual compliance audit for that year, conducted by a qualified independent organization or person.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary may, following written notice, suspend the payment of interest benefits and special allowance to a lender that does not submit its audit within the time period prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The audit required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must—</P>
              <P>(i) Examine the lender's compliance with the Act and applicable regulations;</P>

              <P>(iv) Be conducted at least annually and be submitted to the Secretary within six months of the end of the audit period. The initial audit must be of the lender's first fiscal year that begins after July 23, 1992, and must be submitted within six months of the end of the audit period. Each subsequent audit must cover the lender's activities for the period beginning no later than the end of the period covered by the preceding audit; and<PRTPAGE P="118"/>

              <P>(3) The Secretary may determine that a lender has met the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section if the lender has been audited in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 7502 for other purposes, the lender submits the results of the audit to the Office of Inspector General, and the Secretary determines that the audit meets the requirements of this paragraph.</P>

Excess interest is calculated and recovered each quarter by subtracting the special allowance support level from the applicable interest rate, multiplying the result by the average daily principal balance of the loan (not including unearned interest added to principal) during the quarter, and dividing by four.</P>

For a borrower's loans held by a guaranty agency on which a reinsurance claim has been paid by the Secretary, the guaranty agency must afford a defaulted borrower, upon the borrower's request, renewed eligibility for Title IV assistance once the borrower has made satisfactory repayment arrangements as that term is defined in § 682.200.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 682.402</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Death, disability, closed school, false certification, unpaid refunds, and bankruptcy payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Rules governing the payment of claims based on filing for relief in bankruptcy, and discharge of loans due to death, total and permanent disability, attendance at a school that closes, false certification by a school of a borrower's eligibility for a loan, and unpaid refunds by a school are set forth in this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If a Consolidation loan was obtained jointly by a married couple, the amount of the Consolidation loan that is discharged if one of the borrowers dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled is equal to the portion of the outstanding balance of the Consolidation loan, as of the date the borrower died or became totally and permanently disabled, attributable to any of that borrower's loans that would have been eligible for discharge.</P>
              <P>(3) If a PLUS loan was obtained by two parents as co-makers, and only one of the borrowers dies, becomes totally and permanently disabled, has collection of his or her loan obligation stayed by a bankruptcy filing, or has that obligation discharged in bankruptcy, the other borrower remains obligated to repay the loan unless that borrower would qualify for discharge of the loan under these regulations.</P>
              <P>(4) Except for a borrower's loan obligation discharged by the Secretary under the false certification discharge provision of paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, a loan qualifies for payment under this section and as provided in paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section, only to the extent that the loan is legally enforceable under applicable law by the holder of the loan.</P>
              <P>(5) For purposes of this section—</P>
              <P>(i) The legal enforceability of a loan is conclusively determined on the basis of a ruling by a court or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction with respect to that loan, or a ruling with respect to another loan in a judgment that collaterally estops the holder from contesting the enforceability of the loan;</P>
              <P>(ii) A loan is conclusively determined to be legally unenforceable to the extent that the guarantor determines, pursuant to an objection presented in a proceeding conducted in connection with consumer reporting agency reporting, tax refund offset, wage garnishment, or in any other administrative proceeding, that the loan is not legally enforceable; and</P>

              <P>(iii) If an objection has been raised by the borrower or another party about the legal enforceability of the loan and no determination has been made under paragraph (a)(5) (i) or (ii) of this section, the Secretary may authorize the payment of a claim under this section <PRTPAGE P="125"/>under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate. If the Secretary determines in that or any other case that a claim was paid under this section with respect to a loan that was not a legally enforceable obligation of the borrower, the recipient of that payment must refund that amount of the payment to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Death.</E> (1) If an individual borrower dies, or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan dies, the obligation of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is discharged.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) A discharge of a loan based on the death of the borrower (or student in the case of a PLUS loan) must be based on—</P>
              <P>(A) An original or certified copy of the death certificate;</P>
              <P>(B) An accurate and complete photocopy of the original or certified copy of the death certificate;</P>
              <P>(C) An accurate and complete original or certified copy of the death certificate that is scanned and submitted electronically or sent by facsimile transmission; or</P>
              <P>(D) Verification of the borrower's or student's death through an authoritative Federal or State electronic database approved for use by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(ii) Under exceptional circumstances and on a case-by-case basis, the chief executive officer of the guaranty agency may approve a discharge based upon other reliable documentation of the borrower's or student's death.</P>
              <P>(3) After receiving reliable information indicating that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender must suspend any collection activity against the borrower and any endorser for up to 60 days and promptly request the documentation described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If additional time is required to obtain the documentation, the period of suspension of collection activity may be extended up to an additional 60 days. If the lender is not able to obtain an original or certified copy of the death certificate, or an accurate and complete photocopy of the original or certified copy of the death certificate or other documentation acceptable to the guaranty agency, under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, during the period of suspension, the lender must resume collection activity from the point that it had been discontinued. The lender is deemed to have exercised forbearance as to repayment of the loan during the period when collection activity was suspended.</P>
              <P>(4) Once the lender has determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender may not attempt to collect on the loan from the borrower's estate or from any endorser.</P>
              <P>(5) The lender shall return to the sender any payments received from the estate or paid on behalf of the borrower after the date of the borrower's (or student's) death.</P>
              <P>(6) In the case of a Federal Consolidation Loan that includes a Federal PLUS or Direct PLUS loan borrowed for a dependent who has died, the obligation of the borrower or any endorser to make any further payments on the portion of the outstanding balance of the Consolidation Loan attributable to the Federal PLUS or Direct PLUS loan is discharged as of the date of the dependent's death.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) <E T="03">Total and permanent disability.</E> (i) A borrower's loan is discharged if the borrower becomes totally and permanently disabled, as defined in § 682.200(b), and satisfies the eligibility requirements in this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) For a borrower who becomes totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 682.200(b), the borrower's loan discharge application is processed in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(8) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) For a veteran who is totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (2) of the definition of that term in § 682.200(b), the veteran's loan discharge application is processed in accordance with paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) For purposes of this paragraph (c)—</P>

              <P>(A) A borrower's representative or a veteran's representative is a member of the borrower's family, the borrower's attorney, or another individual authorized to act on behalf of the borrower in connection with the borrower's total <PRTPAGE P="126"/>and permanent disability discharge application.

              <P>(B) If a loan subject to paragraph (d) of this section was discharged in part in accordance with the Secretary's “Closed School Policy” as authorized by section IV of Bulletin 89-G-159, the guaranty agency shall initiate the discharge of the remaining balance of the loan not later than August 13, 1994.</P>
              <P>(C) A guaranty agency shall review its records and identify all schools that appear to have closed on or after January 1, 1986 and prior to June 13, 1994, and shall identify the loans made to any borrower (or student) who appears to have been enrolled at the school on the school closure date or who withdrew not more than 120 days prior to the closure date.</P>
              <P>(D) A guaranty agency shall notify the Secretary immediately if it determines that a school not previously known to have closed appears to have closed, and, within 30 days of making that determination, notify all lenders participating in its program to suspend collection efforts against individuals with respect to loans made for attendance at the closed school, if the student to whom (or on whose behalf) a loan was made, appears to have been enrolled at the school on the closing date, or withdrew not more than 120 days prior to the date the school appears to have closed.

The application shall inform the borrower of the procedures and eligibility criteria for obtaining a discharge.</P>

              <P>(C) If a loan identified under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section is held by the guaranty agency as a defaulted loan and the borrower's current address is known, the guaranty agency shall immediately suspend any efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan received for the program of study for which the loan was made (but may continue to receive borrower payments), and notify the borrower that the agency will provide additional information about the procedures for requesting a discharge after the agency <PRTPAGE P="135"/>has received confirmation from the Secretary that the school had closed.</P>

Upon learning the new address of a borrower who would still be considered potentially eligible for a discharge, the guaranty agency shall, within 30 days after learning the borrower's new address, mail to the borrower a discharge application that meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>

              <P>(G) Upon receipt of a closed school discharge claim filed by a lender, the agency shall review the borrower's completed application in light of information available from the records of the agency and from other sources, including other guaranty agencies, state authorities, and cognizant accrediting associations, and shall take the following actions—</P>

              <P>(J) A borrower's request for discharge may not be denied solely on the basis of failing to meet any time limits set by the lender, guaranty agency, or the Secretary.</P>

              <P>(7) <E T="03">Lender responsibilities.</E> (i) A lender shall comply with the requirements prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. In the absence of specific instructions from a guaranty agency or the Secretary, if a lender receives information from a source it believes to be reliable indicating that an existing or former borrower may be eligible for a loan discharge under paragraph (d) of this section, the lender shall immediately notify the guaranty agency, and suspend any efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan received for the program of study for which the loan was made (but may continue to receive borrower payments).</P>
              <P>(ii) If the borrower fails to submit a completed application described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section within 60 days of being notified of that option, the lender shall resume collection and shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment of principal and interest from the date the lender suspended collection activity. The lender may capitalize, in accordance with § 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid during that period. Upon resuming collection, the lender provides the borrower with another discharge application and an explanation of the requirements and procedures for obtaining a discharge.</P>

On or after July 1, 2006, the Secretary reimburses the holder of a loan, and discharges a borrower's obligation with respect to the loan in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, if the borrower's eligibility to receive the loan was falsely certified as a result of a crime of identity theft. For purposes of a false certification discharge, the term “borrower” includes all endorsers on a loan. A student's or other individual's eligibility to borrow shall be considered to have been falsely certified by the school if the school—</P>
              <P>(A) Certified the student's eligibility for a FFEL Program loan on the basis of ability to benefit from its training and the student did not meet the applicable requirements described in 34 CFR part 668 and section 484(d) of the Act, as applicable and as described in paragraph (e)(13) of this section; or</P>

              <P>(ii) The Secretary discharges the obligation of a borrower with respect to a loan disbursement for which the school, without the borrower's authorization, endorsed the borrower's loan check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, unless the student for whom the loan was made received the proceeds of the loan either by actual delivery of the loan funds or by a credit in the amount of the contested disbursement applied to charges owed to the school for that portion of the educational program completed by the student. However, the Secretary does not reimburse the lender with respect to any amount disbursed by means of a check bearing an unauthorized endorsement unless the school also executed the application or promissory note for that loan for the named borrower without that individual's consent.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a loan was made as a result of the crime of identity theft that was committed by an employee or agent of the lender, or if at the time the loan was made, an employee or agent of the lender knew of the identity theft of the individual named as the borrower—</P>
              <P>(A) The Secretary does not pay reinsurance, and does not reimburse the holder, for any amount disbursed on the loan; and</P>

              <P>(ii) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through enforced collection on a loan obligation discharged under paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) A borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under paragraph (e) of this section is not regarded as in default on the loan after discharge, and is eligible to receive assistance under the Title IV, HEA programs.</P>
              <P>(iv) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section is reported by the loan holder to all credit reporting agencies to which the holder previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete all adverse or inaccurate credit history assigned to the loan.</P>
              <P>(v) Discharge under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section qualifies the borrower for relief only with respect to the amount of the disbursement discharged.</P>

              <P>(l) <E T="03">Unpaid refund discharge</E>—(1) <E T="03">Unpaid refunds in closed school situations.</E> In the case of a school that has closed, the Secretary reimburses the guarantor of a loan and discharges a former or current borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay that portion of an FFEL Program loan (disbursed, in whole or in part on or after January 1, 1986) equal to the refund that should have been made by the school under applicable Federal law and regulations, including this section. Any accrued interest and other charges (late charges, collection costs, origination fees, and insurance premiums or Federal default fees) associated with the unpaid refund are also discharged.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Unpaid refunds in open school situations.</E> In the case of a school that is open, the guarantor discharges a former or current borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay that portion of an FFEL loan (disbursed, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986) equal to the amount of the refund that should have been made by the school under applicable Federal law and regulations, including this section, if—</P>
              <P>(i) The borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) is not attending the school that owes the refund; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The guarantor receives documentation regarding the refund and the borrower and guarantor have been unable to resolve the unpaid refund within 120 days from the date the guarantor receivesa complete application in accordance with paragraph (l)(4) of this section. Any accrued interest and other charges (late charges, collection costs, origination fees, and insurance premiums or Federal default fees) associated with the amount of the unpaid refund amount are also discharged.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Relief to borrower (and any endorser) following discharge.</E> (i) If a borrower receives a discharge of a portion of a loan under this section, the borrower is reimbursed for any amounts paid in excess of the remaining balance of the loan (including accrued interest, late charges, collection costs, origination fees, and insurance premiums or Federal default fees) owed by the borrower at the time of discharge.</P>
              <P>(ii) The holder of the loan reports the discharge of a portion of a loan under this section to all credit reporting agencies to which the holder of the loan previously reported the status of the loan.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Borrower qualification for discharge.</E> To receive a discharge of a portion of a loan under this section, a borrower must submit a written application to the holder or guaranty agency except as provided in paragraph (l)(5)(iv) of this section. The application requests the information required to calculate the amount of the discharge and requires the borrower to sign a statement swearing to the accuracy of the information in the application. The statement need not be notarized but must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. In the statement, the borrower must—</P>
              <P>(i) State that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed)—</P>
              <P>(A) Received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986 to attend a school;</P>
              <P>(B) Did not attend, withdrew, or was terminated from the school within a timeframe that entitled the borrower to a refund; and</P>
              <P>(C) Did not receive the benefit of a refund to which the borrower was entitled either from the school or from a third party, such as a holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program.</P>
              <P>(ii) State whether the borrower has any other application for discharge pending for this loan; and</P>
              <P>(iii) State that the borrower—</P>

              <P>(A) Agrees to provide upon request by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee other documentation reasonably <PRTPAGE P="153"/>available to the borrower that demonstrates that the borrower meets the qualifications for an unpaid refund discharge under this section; and</P>
              <P>(B) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee in enforcement actions in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and to transfer any right to recovery against a third party to the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Unpaid refund discharge procedures.</E> (i) Except for the requirements of paragraph (l)(5)(iv) of this section related to an open school, if the holder or guaranty agency learns that a school did not pay a refund of loan proceeds owed under applicable law and regulations, the holder or the guaranty agency sends the borrower a discharge application and an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The holder of the loan also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the borrower on any affected loan.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the borrower returns the application, specified in paragraph (l)(4) of this section, the holder or the guaranty agency must review the application to determine whether the application appears to be complete. In the case of a loan held by a lender, once the lender determines that the application appears complete, it must provide the application and all pertinent information to the guaranty agency including, if available, the borrower's last date of attendance. If the borrower returns the application within 60 days, the lender must extend the period during which efforts to collect on the affected loan are suspended to the date the lender receives either a denial of the request or the unpaid refund amount from the guaranty agency. At the conclusion of the period during which the collection activity was suspended, the lender may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period in accordance with § 682.202(b).</P>
              <P>(iii) If the borrower fails to return the application within 60 days, the holder of the loan resumes collection efforts and grants forbearance of principal and interest for the period during which the collection activity was suspended. The holder may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period in accordance with § 682.202(b).</P>
              <P>(iv) The guaranty agency may, with the approval of the Secretary, discharge a portion of a loan under this section without an application if the guaranty agency determines, based on information in the guaranty agency's possession, that the borrower qualifies for a discharge.</P>
              <P>(v) If the holder of the loan or the guaranty agency determines that the information contained in its files conflicts with the information provided by the borrower, the guaranty agency must use the most reliable information available to it to determine eligibility for and the appropriate payment of the refund amount.</P>
              <P>(vi) If the holder of the loan is the guaranty agency and the agency determines that the borrower qualifies for a discharge of an unpaid refund, the guaranty agency must suspend any efforts to collect on the affected loan and, within 30 days of its determination, discharge the appropriate amount and inform the borrower of its determination. Absent documentation of the exact amount of refund due the borrower, the guaranty agency must calculate the amount of the unpaid refund using the unpaid refund calculation defined in paragraph (o) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vii) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower does not qualify for an unpaid refund discharge, (or, if the holder is the lender and is informed by the guarantor that the borrower does not qualify for a discharge)—</P>
              <P>(A) Within 30 days of the guarantor's determination, the agency must notify the borrower in writing of the reason for the determination and of the borrower's right to request a review of the agency's determination. The guaranty agency must make a determination within 30 days of the borrower's submission of additional documentation supporting the borrower's eligibility that was not considered in any prior determination. During the review period, collection activities must be suspended; and</P>

              <P>(B) The holder must resume collection if the determination remains unchanged and grant forbearance of principal and interest for any period during <PRTPAGE P="154"/>which collection activity was suspended under this section. The holder may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during these periods in accordance with § 682.202(b).</P>
              <P>(viii) If the guaranty agency determines that a current or former borrower at an open school may be eligible for a discharge under this section, the guaranty agency must notify the lender and the school of the unpaid refund allegation. The notice to the school must include all pertinent facts available to the guaranty agency regarding the alleged unpaid refund. The school must, no later than 60 days after receiving the notice, provide the guaranty agency with documentation demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the guarantor, that the alleged unpaid refund was either paid or not required to be paid.</P>
              <P>(ix) In the case of a school that does not make a refund or provide sufficient documentation demonstrating the refund was either paid or was not required, within 60 days of its receipt of the allegation notice from the guaranty agency, relief is provided to the borrower (and any endorser) if the guaranty agency determines the relief is appropriate. The agency must forward documentation of the school's failure to pay the unpaid refund to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Unpaid refund discharge procedures for a loan held by a lender.</E> In the case of an unpaid refund discharge request, the lender must provide the guaranty agency with documentation related to the borrower's qualification for discharge as specified in paragraph (l)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Payment of an unpaid refund discharge request by a guaranty agency</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The guaranty agency must review an unpaid refund discharge request promptly and must pay the lender the amount of loss as defined in paragraphs (l)(1) and (l)(2) of this section, related to the unpaid refund not later than 45 days after a properly filed request is made.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination of the unpaid refund discharge amount to the lender.</E> The amount of loss payable to a lender on an unpaid refund includes that portion of an FFEL Program loan equal to the amount of the refund required under applicable Federal law and regulations, including this section, and including any accrued interest and other charges (late charges, collection costs, origination fees, and insurance premiums or Federal default fees) associated with the unpaid refund.</P>
              <P>(o)(1) <E T="03">Determination of amount eligible for discharge.</E> The guaranty agency determines the amount eligible for discharge based on information showing the refund amount or by applying the appropriate refund formula to information that the borrower provides or that is otherwise available to the guaranty agency. For purposes of this section, all unpaid refunds are considered to be attributed to loan proceeds.</P>
              <P>(2) If the information in paragraph (o)(1) of this section is not available, the guaranty agency uses the following formulas to determine the amount eligible for discharge:</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of a student who fails to attend or whose withdrawal or termination date is before October 7, 2000 and who completes less than 60 percent of the loan period, the guaranty agency discharges the lesser of the institutional charges unearned or the loan amount. The guaranty agency determines the amount of the institutional charges unearned by—</P>
              <P>(A) Calculating the ratio of the amount of time in the loan period after the student's last day of attendance to the actual length of the loan period; and</P>
              <P>(B) Multiplying the resulting factor by the institutional charges assessed the student for the loan period.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of a student who fails to attend or whose withdrawal or termination date is on or after October 7, 2000 and who completes less than 60 percent of the loan period, the guaranty agency discharges the loan amount unearned. The guaranty agency determines the loan amount unearned by—</P>
              <P>(A) Calculating the ratio of the amount of time remaining in the loan period after the student's last day of attendance to the actual length of the loan period; and</P>

              <P>(B) Multiplying the resulting factor by the total amount of title IV grants and loans received by the student, or if unknown, the loan amount.<PRTPAGE P="155"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of a student who completes 60 percent or more of the loan period, the guaranty agency does not discharge any amount because a student who completes 60 percent or more of the loan period is not entitled to a refund.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Requests for reimbursement from the Secretary on loans held by guaranty agencies.</E> The Secretary reimburses the guaranty agency for its losses on unpaid refund request payments to lenders or borrowers in an amount that is equal to the amount specified in paragraph (n)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Payments received after the guaranty agency's payment of an unpaid refund request.</E> (1) The holder must promptly return to the sender any payment on a fully discharged loan, received after the guaranty agency pays an unpaid refund request unless the sender is required to pay (as in the case of a tuition recovery fund) in which case, the payment amount must be forwarded to the Secretary. At the same time that the holder returns the payment, it must notify the borrower that there is no obligation to repay a loan fully discharged.</P>
              <P>(2) If the holder has returned a payment to the borrower, or the borrower's representative, with the notice described in paragraph (q)(1) of this section, and the borrower (or representative) continues to send payments to the holder, the holder must remit all of those payments to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(3) If the loan has not been fully discharged, payments must be applied to the remaining debt.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">Payments received after the Secretary's payment of a death, disability, closed school, false certification, or bankruptcy claim</E> (1) If the guaranty agency receives any payments from or on behalf of the borrower on or attributable to a loan that has been discharged in bankruptcy on which the Secretary previously paid a bankruptcy claim, the guaranty agency must return 100 percent of these payments to the sender. The guaranty agency must promptly return, to the sender, any payment on a cancelled or discharged loan made by the sender and received after the Secretary pays a closed school or false certification claim. At the same time that the agency returns the payment, it must notify the borrower that there is no obligation to repay a loan discharged on the basis of death, bankruptcy, false certification, or closing of the school.</P>
              <P>(2) If the guaranty agency receives any payments from or on behalf of the borrower on or attributable to a loan that has been assigned to the Secretary based on the determination that the borrower is eligible for a total and permanent disability discharge, the guaranty agency must promptly return these payments to the sender. At the same time that the agency returns the payments, it must notify the borrower that there is no obligation to make payments on the loan after it has been discharged due to a total and permanent disability, unless the loan is reinstated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, or the Secretary directs the borrower otherwise.</P>
              <P>(3) When the Secretary discharges the loan, the Secretary returns to the sender any payments received by the Secretary on the loan after the date the borrower became totally and permanently disabled.</P>
              <P>(4) The guaranty agency shall remit to the Secretary all payments received from a tuition recovery fund, performance bond, or other third party with respect to a loan on which the Secretary previously paid a closed school or false certification claim.</P>
              <P>(5) If the guaranty agency has returned a payment to the borrower, or the borrower's representative, with the notice described in paragraphs (r)(1) or (r)(2) of this section, and the borrower (or representative) continues to send payments to the guaranty agency, the agency must remit all of those payments to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(s) <E T="03">Applicable suspension of the repayment period.</E> For purposes of this section and 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(A) with respect to loans guaranteed under the FFEL Program, an applicable suspension of the repayment period—</P>
              <P>(1) Includes any period during which the lender does not require the borrower to make a payment on the loan.</P>

              <P>(2) Begins on the date on which the borrower qualifies for the requested deferment as provided in § 682.210(a)(5) <PRTPAGE P="156"/>or the lender grants the requested forbearance;</P>
              <P>(3) Closes on the later of the date on which—</P>
              <P>(i) The condition for which the requested deferment or forbearance was received ends; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The lender receives notice of the end of the condition for which the requested deferment or forbearance was received, if the condition ended earlier than represented by the borrower at the time of the request and the borrower did not notify timely the lender of the date on which the condition actually ended;</P>
              <P>(4) Includes the period between the end of the borrower's grace period and the first payment due date established by the lender in the case of a borrower who entered repayment without the knowledge of the lender;</P>
              <P>(5) Includes the period between the filing of the petition for relief and the date on which the proceeding is completed or dismissed, unless payments have been made during that period in amounts sufficient to meet the amount owed under the repayment schedule in effect when the petition was filed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Federal reinsurance agreement.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The Secretary may enter into a reinsurance agreement with a guaranty agency that has a basic program agreement. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, under a reinsurance agreement, the Secretary reimburses the guaranty agency for—</P>
              <P>(i) 95 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders on loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after October 1, 1998;</P>
              <P>(ii) 98 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders for loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after October 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1998; or</P>
              <P>(iii) 100 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders—</P>
              <P>(A) For loans for which the first disbursement is made prior to October 1, 1993;</P>
              <P>(B) For loans made under an approved lender-of-last-resort program;</P>
              <P>(C) For loans transferred under a plan approved by the Secretary from an insolvent guaranty agency or a guaranty agency that withdraws its participation in the FFEL Program;</P>
              <P>(D) For loans that meet the definition of exempt claims in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section;</P>
              <P>(E) For a guaranty agency that entered into a basic program agreement under section 428(b) of the Act after September 30, 1976, or was not actively carrying on a loan guarantee program covered by a basic program agreement on October 1, 1976 for five consecutive fiscal years beginning with the first year of its operation.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of this section—</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Losses</E> means the amount of unpaid principal and accrued interest the agency paid on a default claim filed by a lender on a reinsured loan, minus payments made by or on behalf of the borrower after default but before the Secretary reimburses the agency;</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Default aversion assistance</E> means the activities of a guaranty agency that are designed to prevent a default by a borrower who is at least 60 days delinquent and that are directly related to providing collection assistance to the lender.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Exempt claims</E> means claims with respect to loans for which it is determined that the borrower (or student on whose behalf a parent has borrowed), without the lender's or the institution's knowledge at the time the loan was made, provided false or erroneous information or took actions that caused the borrower or the student to be ineligible for all of a portion of the loan or for interest benefits on the loan.</P>

              <P>(3) A guaranty agency's loss on a loan that was outstanding when a reinsurance agreement was executed is covered by the reinsurance agreement only if the default on the loan occurs <PRTPAGE P="157"/>after the effective date of the agreement.</P>
              <P>(4) If a lender has requested default aversion assistance as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the agency must, upon request of the school at which the borrower received the loan, notify the school of the lender's request. The guaranty agency may not charge the school or the school's agent for providing this notification and must accept a blanket request from the school to be notified whenever any of the school's current or former students are the subject of a default aversion assistance request. The agency must notify schools annually of the option to make this blanket request.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reduction in reinsurance rate.</E> (1) If the total of reinsurance claims paid by the Secretary to a guaranty agency during any fiscal year reaches 5 percent of the amount of loans in repayment at the end of the preceding fiscal year, the Secretary's reinsurance payment on a default claim subsequently paid by the guaranty agency during that fiscal year equals—</P>
              <P>(i) 90 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders on loans for which the first disbursement is made before October 1, 1993 or transferred under a plan approved by the Secretary from an insolvent guaranty agency or a guaranty agency that withdraws its participation in the FFEL Program;</P>

              <P>(iii) 85 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders on loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after October 1, 1998.</P>
              <P>(2) If the total of reinsurance claims paid by the Secretary to a guaranty agency during any fiscal year reaches 9 percent of the amount of loans in repayment at the end of the preceding fiscal year, the Secretary's reinsurance payment on a default claim subsequently paid by the guaranty agency during that fiscal year equals—</P>
              <P>(i) 80 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders on loans for which the first disbursement is made before October 1, 1993 or transferred under a plan approved by the Secretary from an insolvent guaranty agency or a guaranty agency that withdraws its participation in the FFEL Program;</P>
              <P>(ii) 78 percent of its losses on default claim payments to lenders on loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after October 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1998; or</P>

              <P>(3) For purposes of this section, the total of reinsurance claims paid by the Secretary to a guaranty agency during any fiscal year does not include amounts paid on claims by the guaranty agency—</P>
              <P>(i) On loans considered in default under § 682.412(e);</P>
              <P>(ii) Under a policy established by the agency that addresses instances in which, for a non-school originated loan, a lender learns that the school terminated its teaching activities while a student was enrolled during the academic period covered by the loan;</P>
              <P>(iii) That were filed by lenders at the direction of the Secretary; or</P>
              <P>(iv) On loans made under a guaranty agency's approved lender-of-last-resort program.</P>
              <P>(4) For purposes of this section, <E T="03">amount of loans in repayment</E> means—</P>
              <P>(i) The sum of—</P>

              <P>(E) The borrower was in deferment status at the time repayment was scheduled to begin and remains in deferment status;</P>
              <P>(F) Reinsurance coverage has been lost and cannot be regained; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Loan rehabilitation agreement.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) A guaranty agency that has a basic program agreement <PRTPAGE P="160"/>must enter into a loan rehabilitation agreement with the Secretary. The guaranty agency must establish a loan rehabilitation program for all borrowers with an enforceable promissory note for the purpose of rehabilitating defaulted loans, except for loans for which a judgment has been obtained, loans on which a default claim was filed under § 682.412, and loans on which the borrower has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving fraud in obtaining title IV, HEA program assistance, so that the loan may be purchased, if practicable, by an eligible lender and removed from default status.</P>
              <P>(2) A loan is considered to be rehabilitated only after—</P>
              <P>(i) The borrower has made and the guaranty agency has received nine of the ten qualifying payments required under a monthly repayment agreement.</P>
              <P>(A) A qualifying payment is—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Made voluntarily;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) In the full amount required; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Received within 20 days of the due date for the payment, and</P>
              <P>(B) All nine payments are received within a 10-month period that begins with the month in which the first required due date falls and ends with the ninth consecutive calendar month following that month, and</P>
              <P>(ii) The loan has been sold to an eligible lender or assigned to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) If a borrower's loan is being collected by administrative wage garnishment while the borrower is also making monthly payments on the same loan under a loan rehabilitation agreement, the guaranty agency must continue collecting the loan by administrative wage garnishment until the borrower makes five qualifying monthly payments under the rehabilitation agreement, unless the guaranty agency is otherwise precluded from doing so under § 682.410(b)(9).</P>
              <P>(ii) After the borrower makes the fifth qualifying monthly payment, the guaranty agency must, unless otherwise directed by the borrower, suspend the garnishment order issued to the borrower's employer.</P>
              <P>(iii) A borrower may only obtain the benefit of a suspension of administrative wage garnishment while also attempting to rehabilitate a defaulted loan once.</P>
              <P>(4) After the loan has been rehabilitated, the borrower regains all benefits of the program, including any remaining deferment eligibility under section 428(b)(1)(M) of the Act, from the date of the rehabilitation. Effective for any loan that is rehabilitated on or after August 14, 2008, the borrower cannot rehabilitate the loan again if the loan returns to default status following the rehabilitation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Terms of agreement.</E> In the loan rehabilitation agreement, the guaranty agency agrees to ensure that its loan rehabilitation program meets the following requirements at all times:</P>
              <P>(1) A borrower may request rehabilitation of the borrower's defaulted loan held by the guaranty agency. In order to be eligible for rehabilitation of the loan, the borrower must voluntarily make at least 9 of the 10 payments required under a monthly repayment agreement.</P>
              <P>(i) Each payment must be—</P>
              <P>(A) Made voluntarily;</P>
              <P>(B) For the full amount required;</P>
              <P>(C) Received within 20 days of the due date for the payment; and</P>
              <P>(D) Reasonable and affordable.</P>
              <P>(ii) All 9 payments must be received within a 10-month period that begins with the month in which the first required due date falls and ends with the ninth consecutive calendar month following that month.</P>
              <P>(iii) The guaranty agency initially considers the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount to be an amount equal to 15 percent of the amount by which the borrower's Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) exceeds 150 percent of the poverty guideline amount applicable to the borrower's family size and State, divided by 12, except that if this amount is less than $5, the borrower's monthly rehabilitation payment is $5.</P>

              <P>(iv) The guaranty agency or its agents may calculate the payment amount based on information provided orally by the borrower or the borrower's representative and provide the borrower with a rehabilitation agreement using that amount. The guaranty agency must request documentation <PRTPAGE P="161"/>from the borrower to confirm the borrower's AGI and family size. If the borrower does not provide the guaranty agency or its agents with any documentation requested by the guaranty agency to calculate or confirm the reasonable and affordable payment amount, within a reasonable time deadline set by the guaranty agency or its agent, the rehabilitation agreement provided is null and void.</P>
              <P>(v) The reasonable and affordable payment amount calculated under this section must not be—</P>
              <P>(A) A required minimum loan payment amount (e.g., $50) if the agency determines that a smaller amount is reasonable and affordable;</P>
              <P>(B) A percentage of the borrower's total loan balance; or</P>
              <P>(C) Based on other criteria unrelated to the borrower's total financial circumstances.</P>
              <P>(vi) Within 15 business days of its determination of the borrower's loan rehabilitation payment amount, the guaranty agency must provide the borrower with a written rehabilitation agreement which includes the borrower's payment amount calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii), a prominent statement that the borrower may object orally or in writing to the payment amount, with the method and timeframe for raising such an objection, and an explanation of any other terms and conditions applicable to the required series of payments that must be made before the borrower's account can be considered for repurchase by an eligible lender or assignment to the Secretary (i.e., rehabilitated). To accept the agreement, the borrower must sign and return the agreement or accept the agreement electronically under a process provided by the agency. The agency may not impose any conditions unrelated to the amount or timing of the rehabilitation payments in the rehabilitation agreement. The written rehabilitation agreement must inform the borrower—</P>
              <P>(A) Of the effects of having the loans rehabilitated (e.g., removal of the record of default from the borrower's credit history and return to normal repayment);</P>
              <P>(B) Of the amount of any collection costs to be added to the unpaid principal of the loan when the loan is sold to an eligible lender or assigned to the Secretary, which may not exceed 16 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest on the loan at the time of the sale or assignment; and</P>
              <P>(C) That the rehabilitation agreement is null and void if the borrower fails to provide the documentation required to confirm the monthly payment calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vii) If the borrower objects to the monthly payment amount determined under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the guaranty agency or its agents must recalculate the payment amount based solely on information provided on a form approved by the Secretary and, if requested, supporting documentation from the borrower and other sources, and must consider—</P>
              <P>(A) The borrower's, and if applicable, the spouse's current disposable income, including public assistance payments, and other income received by the borrower and the spouse, such as welfare benefits, Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income, and workers' compensation. Spousal income is not considered if the spouse does not contribute to the borrower's household income;</P>
              <P>(B) Family size as defined in § 682.215(a)(3); and</P>
              <P>(C) Reasonable and necessary expenses, which include—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Food;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Housing;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Utilities;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Basic communication expenses;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Necessary medical and dental costs;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Necessary insurance costs;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) Transportation costs;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Dependent care and other work-related expenses;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">9</E>) Legally required child and spousal support;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">10</E>) Other title IV and non-title IV student loan payments; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">11</E>) Other expenses approved by the Secretary.</P>

              <P>(viii) The guaranty agency must provide the borrower with a new written rehabilitation agreement confirming the borrower's recalculated reasonable and affordable payment amount within the timeframe specified in paragraph <PRTPAGE P="162"/>(b)(1)(vii) of this section. To accept the agreement, the borrower must sign and return the agreement or accept the agreement electronically under a process provided by the agency.</P>
              <P>(ix) The agency must include any payment made under § 682.401(b)(1) in determining whether the 9 out of 10 payments required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been made.</P>
              <P>(x) A borrower may request that the monthly payment amount be adjusted due to a change in the borrower's total financial circumstances only upon providing the documentation specified in paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(xi) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, during the rehabilitation period, the guaranty agency must limit contact with the borrower on the loan being rehabilitated to collection activities that are required by law or regulation and to communications that support the rehabilitation.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) For the purposes of this section, payment in the full amount required means payment of an amount that is reasonable and affordable, based on the borrower's total financial circumstances, as agreed to by the borrower and the agency. Voluntary payments are those made directly by the borrower and do not include payments obtained by Federal offset, garnishment, income or asset execution, or after a judgment has been entered on a loan. A guaranty agency must attempt to secure a lender to purchase the loan at the end of the 9- or 10-month payment period as applicable.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the guaranty agency has been unable to sell the loan, the guaranty agency must assign the loan to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon the sale of a rehabilitated loan to an eligible lender or assignment to the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(i) The guaranty agency must, within 45 days of the sale or assignment—</P>
              <P>(A) Provide notice to the prior holder of such sale or assignment, and</P>
              <P>(B) Request that any consumer reporting agency to which the default was reported remove the record of default from the borrower's credit history.</P>
              <P>(ii) The prior holder of the loan must, within 30 days of receiving the notification from the guaranty agency, request that any consumer reporting agency to which the default claim payment or other equivalent record was reported remove such record from the borrower's credit history.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) An eligible lender purchasing a rehabilitated loan must establish a repayment schedule that meets the same requirements that are applicable to other FFEL Program loans of the same loan type as the rehabilitated loan and must permit the borrower to choose any statutorily available repayment plan for that loan type. The lender must treat the first payment made under the nine payments as the first payment under the applicable maximum repayment term, as defined under § 682.209(a) or (e). For Consolidation loans, the maximum repayment term is based on the balance outstanding at the time of loan rehabilitation.</P>
              <P>(ii) The lender must not consider the purchase of a rehabilitated loan as entry into repayment or resumption of repayment for the purposes of interest capitalization under § 682.202(b).</P>
              <P>(c) A guaranty agency must make available to the borrower—</P>
              <P>(1) During the loan rehabilitation period, information about repayment plans, including the income-based repayment plan, that may be available to the borrower upon rehabilitating the defaulted loan and how the borrower can select a repayment plan after the loan is purchased by an eligible lender or assigned to the Secretary; and</P>
              <P>(2) After the successful completion of the loan rehabilitation period, financial and economic education materials, including debt management information.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Mandatory assignment by guaranty agencies of defaulted loans to the Secretary.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) If the Secretary determines that action is necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary directs a guaranty agency to promptly assign to the Secretary any loans held by the agency on which the agency has received payment under § 682.402(f), 682.402(k), or 682.404. The collection of unpaid loans owed by Federal employees by Federal salary offset is, among other things, deemed to be in the Federal fiscal interest. Unless the Secretary notifies an agency, in writing, that other loans must be assigned to the Secretary, an agency must assign any loan that meets all of the following criteria as of April 15 of each year:</P>
              <P>(i) The unpaid principal balance is at least $100.</P>
              <P>(ii) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the loan, and any other loans held by the agency for that borrower, have been held by the agency for at least four years; for any subsequent fiscal year such loan must have been held by the agency for at least five years.</P>
              <P>(iii) A payment has not been received on the loan in the last year.</P>
              <P>(iv) A judgment has not been entered on the loan against the borrower.</P>
              <P>(2) If the agency fails to meet a fiscal year recovery rate standard under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for a loan type, and the Secretary determines that additional assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary may require the agency to assign in addition to those loans described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, loans in amounts needed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (a)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Calculation of fiscal year loan type recovery rate.</E> A fiscal year loan type recovery rate for an agency is determined by dividing the amount collected on defaulted loans, including collections by Federal Income Tax Refund Offset, for each loan program (i.e., the Stafford, PLUS, SLS, and Consolidation loan programs) by the agency for loans of that program (including payments received by the agency on loans under § 682.401(b)(1) and § 682.409 and the amounts of any loans purchased from the guaranty agency by an eligible lender) during the most recent fiscal year for which data are available by the total of principal and interest owed to an agency on defaulted loans for each loan program at the beginning of the same fiscal year, less accounts permanently assigned to the Secretary through the most recent fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Fiscal year loan type recovery rates standards.</E> (A) If, in each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the fiscal year loan type recovery rate for a loan program for an agency is below 80 percent of the average recovery rate of all active guaranty agencies in each of the same two fiscal years for that program type, and the Secretary determines that additional assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary may require the agency to make additional assignments in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) In any subsequent fiscal year the loan type recovery rate standard for a loan program must be 90 percent of the average recovery rate of all active guaranty agencies.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Non-achievement of loan type recovery rate standards.</E> (A) Unless the Secretary determines under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section that protection of the Federal fiscal interest requires that a lesser amount be assigned, upon notice from the Secretary, an agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery rate described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section must promptly assign to the Secretary a sufficient amount of defaulted loans, in addition to loans to be assigned in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to cause the fiscal year loan type recovery rate of the agency that fiscal year to equal or exceed the average rate of all agencies described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section when recalculated to exclude from the denominator of the agency's fiscal year loan type recovery rate the amount of these additional loans.</P>

              <P>(B) The Secretary, in consultation with the guaranty agency, may require <PRTPAGE P="171"/>the amount of loans to be assigned under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to include particular categories of loans that share characteristics that make the performance of the agency fall below the appropriate percentage of the loan type recovery rate as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Calculation of loan type recovery rate standards.</E> The Secretary, within 30 days after the date for submission of the second quarterly report from all agencies, makes available to all agencies a mid-year report, showing the recovery rate for each agency and the average recovery rate of all active guaranty agencies for each loan type. In addition, the Secretary, within 120 days after the beginning of each fiscal year, makes available a final report showing those rates and the average rate for each loan type for the preceding fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) <E T="03">Determination that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest requires assignments.</E> Upon petition by an agency submitted within 45 days of the notice required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the Secretary may determine that protection of the Federal fiscal interest does not require assignment of all loans described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or of loans in the full amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section only after review of the agency's petition. In making this determination, the Secretary considers all relevant information available to him (including any information and documentation obtained by the Secretary in reviews of the agency or submitted to the Secretary by the agency) as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the Secretary considers information presented by an agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery rate above the average rate of all active agencies to demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be served if any amounts of loans of the loan type required to be assigned to the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are retained by that agency. For any subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary considers information presented by an agency with a fiscal year recovery rate 10 percent above the average rate of all active agencies.</P>
              <P>(B) The Secretary considers information presented by an agency that is required to assign loans under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be served if the agency demonstrates that its compliance with § 682.401(b)(1) and § 682.405 has reduced substantially its fiscal year loan type recovery rate or rates or if the agency is not required to assign amounts of loans that would otherwise have to be assigned.</P>
              <P>(C) The information provided by an agency pursuant to paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section may include, but is not limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The fiscal year loan type recovery rate within such school sectors as the Secretary may designate for the agency, and for all agencies.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The fiscal year loan type recovery rate for loans for the agency and for all agencies categorized by age of the loans as the Secretary may determine.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The performance of the agency, and all agencies, in default aversion.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The agency's performance on judgment enforcement.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The existence and use of any state or guaranty agency-specific collection tools.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) The agency's level of compliance with §§ 682.409 and 682.410(b)(6).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) Other factors that may affect loan repayment such as State or regional unemployment and natural disasters.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Denial of an agency's petition.</E> If the Secretary does not accept the agency's petition, the Secretary provides, in writing, to the agency the Secretary's reasons for concluding that the Federal fiscal interest is best protected by requiring the assignment.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) A guaranty agency that assigns a defaulted loan to the Secretary under this section thereby releases all rights and title to that loan. The Secretary does not pay the guaranty agency any compensation for a loan assigned under this section.</P>

              <P>(2) The guaranty agency does not share in any amounts received by the Secretary on a loan assigned under this section, regardless of the reinsurance <PRTPAGE P="172"/>percentage paid on the loan or the agency's previous collection costs.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) A guaranty agency must assign a loan to the Secretary under this section at the time, in the manner, and with the information and documentation that the Secretary requires. The agency must submit this information and documentation in the form (including magnetic media) and format specified by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(2) The guaranty agency must execute an assignment to the United States of America of all right, title, and interest in the promissory note or judgment evidencing a loan assigned under this section. If more than one loan is made under an MPN, the assignment of the note only applies to the loan or loans being assigned to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(3) If the agency does not provide the required information and documentation in the form and format required by the Secretary, the Secretary may, at his option—</P>
              <P>(i) Allow the agency to revise the agency's submission to include the required information and documentation in the specified form and format;</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of an improperly formatted computer tape, reformat the tape and assess the cost of the activity against the agency;</P>
              <P>(iii) Reorganize the material submitted and assess the cost of that activity against the agency; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Obtain from other agency records and add to the agency's submission any information from the original submission, and assess the cost of that activity against the agency.</P>
              <P>(4) For each loan assigned, the agency shall submit to the Secretary the following documents associated for each loan, assembled in the order listed below:</P>
              <P>(i) The original or a true and exact copy of the promissory note.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any documentation of a judgment entered on the loan.</P>
              <P>(iii) A written assignment of the loan or judgment, unless this assignment is affixed to the promissory note.</P>
              <P>(iv) The loan application, if a separate application was provided to the lender.</P>
              <P>(v) A payment history for the loan, as described in § 682.414(a)(1)(ii)(C).</P>
              <P>(vi) A collection history for the loan, as described in § 682.414(a)(1)(ii)(D).</P>
              <P>(vii) The record of the lender's disbursement of Stafford and PLUS loan funds to the school for delivery to the borrower.</P>
              <P>(viii) If the MPN or promissory note was signed electronically, the name and location of the entity in possession of the original electronic MPN or promissory note.</P>
              <P>(5) The agency may submit copies of required documents in lieu of originals.</P>
              <P>(6) The Secretary may accept the assignment of a loan without all of the documents listed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If directed to do so, the agency must retain these documents for submission to the Secretary at some future date.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) If the Secretary determines that the agency has not submitted a document or record required by paragraph (c) of this section, and the Secretary decides to allow the agency an additional opportunity to submit the omitted document under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the Secretary notifies the agency and provides a reasonable period of time for the agency to submit the omitted record or document.</P>
              <P>(2) If the omitted document is not submitted within the time specified by the Secretary, the Secretary determines whether that omission impairs the Secretary's ability to collect the loan.</P>

              <P>(3) If the Secretary determines that the ability to collect the loan has been impaired under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Secretary assesses the agency the amount paid to the agency under the reinsurance agreement and accrued interest at the rate applicable to the borrower under § 682.410(b)(3).<PRTPAGE P="173"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The Secretary reassigns to the agency that portion of the loan determined to be unenforceable by the Department.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the agency otherwise converts the asset, in whole or in part, to a use unrelated to its guaranty activities, the agency promptly shall deposit into the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section a fair percentage of the fair market value or, in the case <PRTPAGE P="175"/>of a temporary conversion, the rental value of the portion of the asset employed for the unrelated use.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the agency uses funds or assets described in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section in the manner described in that paragraph and makes a cost and maintenance allocation erroneously and in good faith, it shall correct the allocation under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Third-party claims.</E> If the guaranty agency has any claim against any other party to recover funds or other assets for the reserve fund, the claim is the property of the United States.</P>

              <P>(9) <E T="03">Scope of definition.</E> The provisions of this § 682.410(a) define reserve funds and assets for purposes of sections 422 and 428 of the Act. These provisions do not, however, affect the Secretary's authority to use all funds and assets of the agency pursuant to section 428(c)(9)(F)(vi) of the Act.</P>

Except as provided in §§ 682.401(b)(18)(i) and 682.405(b)(1)(iv)(B), the amount charged a borrower must equal the lesser of—</P>

              <P>(B) The deadline established by the agency for requesting administrative review under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(C) of this section must allow the borrower at least 60 days from the date the notice described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section is sent to request that review.</P>

              <P>(G) Explain the opportunities available to the borrower under agency rules to request access to the agency's records on the loan, to request an administrative review of the legal enforceability or past-due status of the loan, and to reach an agreement on repayment terms satisfactory to the agency to prevent the agency from reporting the loan as defaulted to consumer reporting agencies and provide deadlines and method for requesting this relief;</P>
              <P>(H) Unless the agency uses a separate notice to advise the borrower regarding other proposed enforcement actions, describe specifically any other enforcement action, such as offset against Federal or state income tax refunds or wage garnishment that the agency intends to use to collect the debt, and explain the procedures available to the borrower prior to those other enforcement actions for access to records, for an administrative review, or for agreement to alternative repayment terms;</P>
              <P>(I) Describe the grounds on which the borrower may object that the loan obligation as stated in the notice is not a legally enforceable debt owed by the borrower;</P>
              <P>(J) Describe any appeal rights available to the borrower from an adverse decision on administrative review of the loan obligation;</P>
              <P>(K) Describe any right to judicial review of an adverse decision by the agency regarding the legal enforceability or past-due status of the loan obligation;</P>

              <P>(M) Inform the borrower of the options that are available to the borrower to remove the loan from default, including an explanation of the fees and conditions associated with each option.</P>
              <P>(vii) As part of the guaranty agency's response to a borrower who appeals an adverse decision resulting from the agency's administrative review of the loan obligation, the agency must provide the borrower with information on the availability of the Student Loan Ombudsman's office.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Collection efforts on defaulted loans.</E> (i) A guaranty agency must engage in reasonable and documented collection activities on a loan on which it pays a default claim filed by a lender. For a non-paying borrower, the agency must perform at least one activity every 180 days to collect the debt, locate the borrower (if necessary), or determine if the borrower has the means to repay the debt.</P>
              <P>(ii) Within 45 days after paying a lender's default claim, the agency must send a notice to the borrower that contains the information described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. During this time period, the agency also must notify the borrower, either in the notice containing the information described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, or in a separate notice, that if he or she does not make repayment arrangements acceptable to the agency, the agency will promptly initiate procedures to collect the debt. The agency's notification to the borrower must state that the agency may administratively garnish the borrower's wages, file a civil suit to compel repayment, offset the borrower's State and Federal income tax refunds and other payments made by the Federal Government to the borrower, assign the loan to the Secretary in accordance with § 682.409, and take other lawful collection means to collect the debt, at the discretion of the agency. The agency's notification must include a statement that borrowers may have certain legal rights in the collection of debts, and that borrowers may wish to contact counselors or lawyers regarding those rights.</P>
              <P>(iii) Within a reasonable time after all of the information described in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section has been sent, the agency must send at least one notice informing the borrower that the default has been reported to all nationwide consumer reporting agencies and that the borrower's credit rating may thereby have been damaged.</P>
              <P>(iv) The agency must send a notice informing the borrower of the options that are available to remove the loan from default, including an explanation of the fees and conditions associated with each option. This notice must be sent within a reasonable time after the end of the period for requesting an administrative review as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section or, if the borrower has requested an administrative review, within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the administrative review.</P>
              <P>(v) A guaranty agency must attempt an annual Federal offset against all eligible borrowers. If an agency initiates proceedings to offset a borrower's State or Federal income tax refunds and other payments made by the Federal Government to the borrower, it may not initiate those proceedings sooner than 60 days after sending the notice described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) A guaranty agency must initiate administrative wage garnishment proceedings against all eligible borrowers, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(vii) of this section, by following the procedures described in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vii) A guaranty agency may file a civil suit against a borrower to compel repayment only if the borrower has no wages that can be garnished under paragraph (b)(9) of this section, or the agency determines that the borrower has sufficient attachable assets or income that is not subject to administrative wage garnishment that can be used to repay the debt, and the use of litigation would be more effective in collection of the debt.</P>

              <P>(viii) Upon notification by the Secretary that the borrower has made a borrower defense claim related to a <PRTPAGE P="179"/>loan that the borrower intends to consolidate into the Direct Loan Program for the purpose of seeking relief in accordance with § 685.212(k), the guaranty agency must suspend all collection activities on the affected loan for the period designated by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Special conditions for agency payment of a claim.</E> (i) A guaranty agency may adopt a policy under which it pays a claim to a lender on a loan under the condition described in § 682.404(b)(3)(ii).</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon the payment of a claim under a policy described in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, the guaranty agency shall—</P>
              <P>(A) Perform the loan servicing functions required of a lender under § 682.208, except that the agency is not required to follow the consumer reporting agency reporting requirements of that section;</P>
              <P>(B) Perform the functions of the lender during the repayment period of the loan, as required under § 682.209;</P>
              <P>(C) If the borrower is delinquent in repaying the loan at the time the agency pays a claim thereon to the lender or becomes delinquent while the agency holds the loan, exercise due diligence in accordance with § 682.411 in attempting to collect the loan from the borrower and any endorser or co-maker; and</P>
              <P>(D) After the date of default on the loan, if any, comply with paragraph (b)(6) of this section with respect to collection activities on the loan, with the date of default treated as the claim payment date for purposes of those paragraphs.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Preemption of State law.</E> The provisions of paragraphs (b)(2), (5), and (6) of this section preempt any State law, including State statutes, regulations, or rules, that would conflict with or hinder satisfaction of the requirements of these provisions.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Administrative garnishment.</E> (i) If a guaranty agency decides to garnish the disposable pay of a borrower who is not making payments on a loan held by the agency, on which the Secretary has paid a reinsurance claim, it must do so in accordance with the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(A) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment proceedings, the guaranty agency must mail to the borrower's last known address, a written notice described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) The notice must describe—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The nature and amount of the debt;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The intention of the agency to collect the debt through deductions from disposable pay;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) An explanation of the borrower's rights;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The deadlines by which a borrower must exercise those rights; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The consequences of failure to exercise those rights in a timely manner.</P>
              <P>(C) The guaranty agency must offer the borrower an opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the debt.</P>
              <P>(D) The guaranty agency must offer the borrower an opportunity to enter into a written repayment agreement with the agency under terms agreeable to the agency.</P>
              <P>(E)(<E T="03">1</E>) The guaranty agency must offer the borrower an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(F) through (J) of this section and other guidance provided by the Secretary, for any objection regarding the existence, amount, or enforceability of the debt, and any objection that withholding from the borrower's disposable pay in the amount or at the rate proposed in the notice would cause financial hardship to the borrower.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The borrower must request a hearing in writing. At the borrower's option, the hearing may be oral or written. The time and location of the hearing is established by the guaranty agency. An oral hearing may, at the borrower's option, be conducted either in-person or by telephone conference. The agency notifies the borrower of the process for arranging the time and location of an oral hearing. All telephonic charges are the responsibility of the agency. All travel expenses incurred by the borrower in connection with an in-person oral hearing are the responsibility of the borrower.</P>
              <P>(F)(<E T="03">1</E>) If the borrower submits a written request for a hearing on the existence, amount, or enforceability of the debt—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The guaranty agency must provide evidence of the existence of the debt. If <PRTPAGE P="180"/>the agency provides evidence of the existence of the debt, the borrower must prove by the preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists, the debt is not enforceable under applicable law, the amount the guaranty agency claims the borrower owes is incorrect, including that any amount of collection costs assessed to the borrower exceeds the limits established under § 682.410(b)(2), or the debt is not delinquent; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The borrower may raise any of the objections described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F)(<E T="03">1</E>)(<E T="03">i</E>) of this section not raised in the written request, but must do so before a hearing is completed. For purposes of this paragraph, a hearing is completed when the record is closed and the hearing official notifies the parties that no additional evidence or objections will be accepted.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the borrower submits a written request for a hearing on an objection that withholding in the amount or at the rate that the agency proposed in its notice would cause financial hardship to the borrower and the borrower's spouse and dependents—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The borrower bears the burden of proving the claim of financial hardship by a preponderance of the credible evidence by providing credible documentation that the amount of wages proposed in the notice would leave the borrower unable to meet basic living expenses of the borrower, the borrower's spouse, and the borrower's dependents. The documentation must show the amount of the costs incurred for basic living expenses and the income available from any source to meet those expenses;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The borrower's claim of financial hardship must be evaluated by comparing the amounts that the borrower proves are being incurred for basic living expenses against the amounts spent for basic living expenses by families of the same size as the borrower's. For the purposes of this section, the standards published by the Internal Revenue Service under 26 U.S.C. 7122(d)(2) (the ”Collection Financial Standards”) establish the average amounts spent for basic living expenses for families of the same size as the borrower's family;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The amount that the borrower proves is incurred for a type of basic living expense is considered to be reasonable to the extent that the amount does not exceed the amount spent for that expense by families of the same size according to the Collection Financial Standards. If the borrower claims an amount for any basic living expense that exceeds the amount in the Collection Financial Standards, the borrower must prove that the amount claimed is reasonable and necessary;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) If the borrower's objection to the rate or amount proposed in the notice is upheld in part, the garnishment must be ordered at a lesser rate or amount, that is determined will allow the borrower to meet basic living expenses proven to be reasonable and necessary. If this financial hardship determination is made after a garnishment order is already in effect, the guaranty agency must notify the borrower's employer of any change required by the determination in the amount to be withheld or the rate of withholding under that order; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) A determination by a hearing official that financial hardship would result from garnishment is effective for a period not longer than six months after the date of the finding. After this period, the guaranty agency may require the borrower to submit current information regarding the borrower's family income and living expenses. If the borrower fails to submit current information within 30 days of this request, or the guaranty agency concludes from a review of the available evidence that garnishment should now begin or the rate or the amount of an outstanding withholding should be increased, the guaranty agency must notify the borrower and provide the borrower with an opportunity to contest the determination and obtain a hearing on the objection under the procedures in paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section.</P>

              <P>(G) If the borrower's written request for a hearing is received by the guaranty agency on or before the 30th day following the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency may not issue a withholding order until the borrower has been provided the requested <PRTPAGE P="181"/>hearing and a decision has been rendered. The guaranty agency must provide a hearing to the borrower in sufficient time to permit a decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe, to be rendered within 60 days.</P>
              <P>(H) If the borrower's written request for a hearing is received by the guaranty agency after the 30th day following the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency must provide a hearing to the borrower in sufficient time that a decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe, may be rendered within 60 days, but may not delay issuance of a withholding order unless the agency determines that the delay in filing the request was caused by factors over which the borrower had no control, or the agency receives information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order. If a decision is not rendered within 60 days following receipt of a borrower's written request for a hearing, the guaranty agency must suspend the order beginning on the 61st day after the hearing request was received until a hearing is provided and a decision is rendered.</P>
              <P>(I) The hearing official appointed by the agency to conduct the hearing may be any qualified individual, including an administrative law judge. Under no circumstance may the hearing official be under the supervision or control of the head of the guaranty agency or of a third-party servicer or collection contractor employed by the agency. Payment of compensation by the guaranty agency, third-party servicer, or collection contractor employed by the agency to the hearing official for service as a hearing official does not constitute impermissible supervision or control under this paragraph. The guaranty agency must ensure that, except as needed to arrange for administrative matters pertaining to the hearing, including the type of hearing requested by the borrower, the time, place, and manner of conducting an oral hearing, and post-hearing matters such as issuance of a hearing decision, all oral communications between the hearing official and any representative of the guaranty agency or with the borrower are made within the hearing of the other party, and that copies of any written communication with either party are promptly provided to the other party. This paragraph does not preclude a hearing in the absence of one of the parties if the borrower is given proper notice of the hearing, both parties have agreed on the time, place, and manner of the hearing, and one of the parties fails to attend.</P>
              <P>(J) The hearing official must conduct any hearing as an informal proceeding, require witnesses in an oral hearing to testify under oath or affirmation, and maintain a summary record of any hearing. The hearing official must issue a final written decision at the earliest practicable date, but not later than 60 days after the guaranty agency's receipt of the borrower's hearing request. However—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The borrower may request an extension of that deadline for a reasonable period, as determined by the hearing official, for the purpose of submitting additional evidence or raising a new objection described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F)(<E T="03">1</E>)(<E T="03">ii</E>) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The agency may request, and the hearing official must grant, a reasonable extension of time sufficient to enable the guaranty agency to evaluate and respond to any such additional evidence or any objections raised pursuant to paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F)(<E T="03">1</E>)(<E T="03">ii</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(K) An employer served with a garnishment order from the guaranty agency with respect to a borrower whose wages are not then subject to a withholding order of any kind must deduct and pay to the agency from a borrower's disposable pay an amount that does not exceed the smallest of—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The amount specified in the guaranty agency order;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The amount permitted by section 488A(a)(1) of the Act, which is 15 percent of the borrower's disposable pay; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The amount permitted by 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2), which is the amount by which the borrower's disposable pay exceeds 30 times the minimum wage.</P>

              <P>(L) If a borrower's pay is subject to more than one garnishment order—<PRTPAGE P="182"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Unless other Federal law requires a different priority, the employer must pay the agency the amount calculated under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(K) of this section before the employer complies with any later garnishment orders, except a family support withholding order;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If an employer is withholding from a borrower's pay based on a garnishment order served on the employer before the guaranty agency's order, or if a withholding order for family support is served on an employer at any time, the employer must comply with the agency's garnishment order by withholding an amount that is the lesser of—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The amount specified in the guaranty agency order; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The amount calculated under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(L)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section less the amount or amounts withheld under the garnishment order or orders that have priority over the agency's order; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The cumulative withholding for all garnishment orders issued by guaranty agencies may not exceed, for an individual borrower, the amount permitted by 15 U.S.C. 1673, which is the lesser of 25 percent of the borrower's disposable pay or the amount by which the borrower's disposable pay exceeds 30 times the minimum wage. If a borrower owes debts to one or more guaranty agencies, each agency may issue a garnishment order to enforce each of those debts, but no single agency may order a total amount exceeding 15 percent of the disposable pay of a borrower to be withheld. The employer must honor these orders as provided in paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(L)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(M) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(K) and (L) of this section, an employer may withhold and pay a greater amount than required under the order if the borrower gives the employer written consent.</P>
              <P>(N) A borrower may, at any time, raise an objection to the amount or the rate of withholding specified in the guaranty agency's order to the borrower's employer on the ground of financial hardship. However, the guaranty agency is not required to consider such an objection and provide the borrower with a hearing until at least six months after the agency issued the most recent garnishment order, either one for which the borrower did not request a hearing or one that was issued after a hardship-related hearing determination. The agency may provide a hearing in extraordinary circumstances earlier than six months if the borrower's request for review shows that the borrower's financial circumstances have substantially changed after the garnishment notice because of an event such as injury, divorce, or catastrophic illness.</P>
              <P>(O) A garnishment order is effective until the guaranty agency rescinds the order or the agency has fully recovered the amounts owed by the borrower, including interest, late fees, and collections costs. If an employer is unable to honor a garnishment order because the amount available for garnishment is insufficient to pay any portion of the amount stated in the order, the employer must notify the agency and comply with the order when sufficient disposable pay is available. Upon full recovery of the debt, the agency must send the borrower's employer notification to stop wage withholding.</P>
              <P>(P) The guaranty agency must sue any employer for any amount that the employer, after receipt of the withholding order provided by the agency under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(R) of this section, fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to an employee under the employer's normal pay and disbursement cycle.</P>
              <P>(Q) The guaranty agency may not garnish the wages of a borrower whom it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the borrower has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. The borrower has the burden of informing the guaranty agency of the circumstances surrounding the borrower's involuntary separation from employment.</P>

              <P>(R) Unless the guaranty agency receives information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, it must send a withholding order to the employer within 20 days after the borrower fails to make a timely request for a hearing, or, if a timely request for a hearing is made by the borrower, within 20 days <PRTPAGE P="183"/>after a final decision is made by the agency to proceed with garnishment.</P>
              <P>(S) The notice given to the employer under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(R) of this section must contain only the information as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order and to ensure proper credit for payments received. At a minimum, the notice given to the employer includes the borrower's name, address, and Social Security Number, as well as instructions for withholding and information as to where the employer must send payments.</P>
              <P>(T)(<E T="03">1</E>) A guaranty agency may use a third-party servicer or collection contractor to perform administrative activities associated with administrative wage garnishment, but may not allow such a party to conduct required hearings or to determine that a withholding order is to be issued. Subject to the limitations of paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(T)(<E T="03">2</E>) and (<E T="03">3</E>) of this section, administrative activities associated with administrative wage garnishment may include but are not limited to—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Identifying to the agency suitable candidates for wage garnishment pursuant to agency standards;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Obtaining employment information for the purposes of garnishment;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Sending candidates selected for garnishment by the agency notices prescribed by the agency;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) Negotiating alternative repayment arrangements with borrowers;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) Responding to inquiries from notified borrowers;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">vi</E>) Receiving garnishment payments on behalf of the agency;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">vii</E>) Arranging for the retention of hearing officials and for the conduct of hearings on behalf of the agency;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">viii</E>) Providing information to borrowers or hearing officials on the process or conduct of hearings; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ix</E>) Sending garnishment orders and other communications to employers on behalf of the agency.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Only an authorized official of the agency may determine that an individual withholding order is to be issued. The guarantor must record the official's determination for each order it issues, including any order which it causes to be prepared or mailed by a third-party servicer or collection contractor. The guarantor must evidence the official's approval, either by including the official's signature on the order or, if the agency uses a form of withholding order that does not provide for execution by signature, by retaining in the agency's records the identity of the approving official, the date of the approval, the amount or rate of the order, the name and address of the employer to whom the order was issued, and the debt for which the order was issued.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The withholding order must identify the guaranty agency as the holder of the debt, as the issuer of the order, and as the sole party legally authorized to issue the withholding order. If a guaranty agency uses a third-party servicer or collection contractor to prepare and mail a withholding order that includes the name of the servicer or contractor that prepared or mailed the order, the guaranty agency must also ensure that the order contains no captions or representations that the servicer or contractor is the party that issued, or was empowered by Federal law or by the agency to issue, the withholding order.</P>
              <P>(U) As specified in section 488A(a)(8) of the Act, the borrower may seek judicial relief, including punitive damages, if the employer discharges, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against the borrower due to the issuance of a withholding order.</P>
              <P>(V) A guaranty agency is required to suspend a garnishment order when the agency receives a borrower's fifth qualifying payment under a loan rehabilitation agreement with the agency, unless otherwise directed by the borrower, in accordance with § 682.405(a)(3).</P>
              <P>(ii) For purposes of paragraph (b)(9) of this section—</P>
              <P>(A) “Borrower” includes all endorsers on a loan;</P>
              <P>(B) “Day” means calendar day;</P>

              <P>(C) “Disposable pay” means that part of a borrower's compensation for personal services, whether or not denominated as wages from an employer, that remains after the deduction of health insurance premiums and any amounts required by law to be withheld, and includes, but is not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, or vacation pay. <PRTPAGE P="184"/>“Amounts required by law to be withheld” include amounts for deductions such as Social Security taxes and withholding taxes, but do not include any amount withheld under a court order or other withholding order. All references to an amount of disposable pay refer to disposable pay calculated for a single week;</P>
              <P>(D) “Employer” means a person or entity that employs the services of another and that pays the latter's wages or salary and includes, but is not limited to, State and local governments, but does not include an agency of the Federal Government;</P>
              <P>(E) “Financial hardship” means an inability to meet basic living expenses for goods and services necessary for the survival of the borrower and the borrower's spouse and dependents;</P>
              <P>(F) “Garnishment” means the process of withholding amounts from an employee's disposable pay and paying those amounts to a creditor in satisfaction of a withholding order; and</P>
              <P>(G) “Withholding order” means any order for withholding or garnishment of pay issued by the guaranty agency and may also be referred to as “wage garnishment order” or “garnishment order.”</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Conflicts of interest.</E> (i) A guaranty agency shall maintain and enforce written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees, officers, directors, trustees, and agents engaged in the selection, award, and administration of contracts or agreements. The standards of conduct must, at a minimum, require disclosure of financial or other interests and must mandate disinterested decision-making. The standards must provide for appropriate disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of the standards by employees, officers, directors, trustees, or agents of the guaranty agency, and must include provisions to—</P>
              <P>(A) Prohibit any employee, officer, director, trustee, or agent from participating in the selection, award, or decision-making related to the administration of a contract or agreement supported by the reserve fund described in paragraph (a) of this section, if that participation would create a conflict of interest. Such a conflict would arise if the employee, officer, director, trustee, or agent, or any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of those parties has a financial or ownership interest in the organization selected for an award or would benefit from the decision made in the administration of the contract or agreement. The prohibitions described in this paragraph do not apply to employees of a State agency covered by codes of conduct established under State law;</P>
              <P>(B) Ensure sufficient separation of responsibility and authority between its lender claims processing as a guaranty agency and its lending or loan servicing activities, or both, within the guaranty agency or between that agency and one or more affiliates, including independence in direct reporting requirements and such management and systems controls as may be necessary to demonstrate, in the independent audit required under § 682.410(b)(1), that claims filed by another arm of the guaranty agency or by an affiliate of that agency receive no more favorable treatment than that accorded the claims filed by a lender or servicer that is not an affiliate or part of the guaranty agency; and</P>
              <P>(C) Prohibit the employees, officers, directors, trustees, and agents of the guaranty agency, his or her partner, or any member of his or her immediate family, from soliciting or accepting gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or parties to agreements, except that nominal and unsolicited gratuities, favors, or items may be accepted.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Guaranty agency restructuring.</E> If the Secretary determines that action is necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest because of an agency's failure to meet the requirements of § 682.410(b)(10)(i), the Secretary may require the agency to comply with any additional measures that the Secretary believes are appropriate, including the total divestiture of the agency's non-FFEL functions and the agency's interests in any affiliated organization.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Enforcement requirements.</E> A guaranty agency shall take such measures <PRTPAGE P="185"/>and establish such controls as are necessary to ensure its vigorous enforcement of all Federal, State, and guaranty agency requirements, including agreements, applicable to its loan guarantee program, including, at a minimum, the following:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Lender due diligence in collecting guaranty agency loans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In the event of delinquency on an FFEL Program loan, the lender must engage in at least the collection efforts described in paragraphs (c) through (n) of this section, except that in the case of a loan made to a borrower who is incarcerated, residing outside a State, Mexico, or Canada, or whose telephone number is unknown, the lender may send a forceful collection letter instead of each telephone effort required by this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Delinquency.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, delinquency on a loan begins on the first day after the due date of the first missed payment that is not later made. The due date of the first payment is established by the lender but must occur by the deadlines specified in § 682.209(a) or, if the lender first learns after the fact that the borrower has entered the repayment period, no later than 75 days after the day the lender so learns, except as provided in § 682.209(a)(2)(v) and (a)(3)(ii)(E). If a payment is made late, the first day of delinquency is the day after the due date of the next missed payment that is not later made. A payment that is within five dollars of the amount normally required to advance the due date may nevertheless advance the due date if the lender's procedures allow for that advancement.</P>
              <P>(2) At no point during the periods specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section may the lender permit the occurrence of a gap in collection activity, as defined in paragraph (j) of this section, of more than 45 days (60 days in the case of a transfer).</P>
              <P>(3) As part of one of the collection activities provided for in this section, the lender must provide the borrower with information on the availability of the Student Loan Ombudsman's office.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">1-15 days delinquent.</E> Except in the case in which a loan is brought into this period by a payment on the loan, expiration of an authorized deferment or forbearance period, or the lender's receipt from the drawee of a dishonored check submitted as a payment on the loan, the lender during this period must send at least one written notice <PRTPAGE P="187"/>or collection letter to the borrower informing the borrower of the delinquency and urging the borrower to make payments sufficient to eliminate the delinquency. The notice or collection letter sent during this period must include, at a minimum, a lender or servicer contact, a telephone number, and a prominent statement informing the borrower that assistance may be available if he or she is experiencing difficulty in making a scheduled repayment.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">16-180 days delinquent (16-240 days delinquent for a loan repayable in installments less frequently than monthly).</E> (1) Unless exempted under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, during this period the lender must engage in at least four diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone and send at least four collection letters urging the borrower to make the required payments on the loan. At least one of the diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone must occur on or before, and another one must occur after, the 90th day of delinquency. Collection letters sent during this period must include, at a minimum, information for the borrower regarding deferment, forbearance, income-sensitive repayment, income-based repayment and loan consolidation, and other available options to avoid default.</P>
              <P>(2) At least two of the collection letters required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must warn the borrower that, if the loan is not paid, the lender will assign the loan to the guaranty agency that, in turn, will report the default to each nationwide consumer reporting agency, and that the agency may institute proceedings to offset the borrower's State and Federal income tax refunds and other payments made by the Federal Government to the borrower or to garnish the borrower's wages, or to assign the loan to the Federal Government for litigation against the borrower.</P>
              <P>(3) Following the lender's receipt of a payment on the loan or a correct address for the borrower, the lender's receipt from the drawee of a dishonored check received as a payment on the loan, the lender's receipt of a correct telephone number for the borrower, or the expiration of an authorized deferment or forbearance period, the lender is required to engage in only—</P>
              <P>(i) Two diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone during this period, if the loan is less than 91 days delinquent (121 days delinquent for a loan repayable in installments less frequently than monthly) upon receipt of the payment, correct address, correct telephone number, or returned check, or expiration of the deferment or forbearance; or</P>
              <P>(ii) One diligent effort to contact the borrower by telephone during this period if the loan is 91-120 days delinquent (121-180 days delinquent for a loan repayable in installments less frequently than monthly) upon receipt of the payment, correct address, correct telephone number, or returned check, or expiration of the deferment or forbearance.</P>
              <P>(4) A lender need not attempt to contact by telephone any borrower who is more than 120 days delinquent (180 days delinquent for a loan repayable in installments less frequent than monthly) following the lender's receipt of—</P>
              <P>(i) A payment on the loan;</P>
              <P>(ii) A correct address or correct telephone number for the borrower;</P>
              <P>(iii) A dishonored check received from the drawee as a payment on the loan; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The expiration of an authorized deferment or forbearance.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">181-270 days delinquent (241-330 days delinquent for a loan repayable in installments less frequently than monthly).</E> During this period the lender must engage in efforts to urge the borrower to make the required payments on the loan. These efforts must, at a minimum, provide information to the borrower regarding options to avoid default and the consequences of defaulting on the loan.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Final demand.</E> On or after the 241st day of delinquency (the 301st day for loans payable in less frequent installments than monthly) the lender must send a final demand letter to the borrower requiring repayment of the loan in full and notifying the borrower that a default will be reported to each nationwide consumer reporting agency. The lender must allow the borrower at least 30 days after the date the letter is mailed to respond to the final demand <PRTPAGE P="188"/>letter and to bring the loan out of default before filing a default claim on the loan.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Collection procedures when borrower's telephone number is not available.</E> Upon completion of a diligent but unsuccessful effort to ascertain the correct telephone number of a borrower as required by paragraph (m) of this section, the lender is excused from any further efforts to contact the borrower by telephone, unless the borrower's number is obtained before the 211th day of delinquency (the 271st day for loans repayable in installments less frequently than monthly).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Skip-tracing.</E> (1) Unless the letter specified under paragraph (f) of this section has already been sent, within 10 days of its receipt of information indicating that it does not know the borrower's current address, the lender must begin to diligently attempt to locate the borrower through the use of effective commercial skip-tracing techniques. These efforts must include, but are not limited to, sending a letter to or making a diligent effort to contact each endorser, relative, reference, individual, and entity, identified in the borrower's loan file, including the schools the student attended. For this purpose, a lender's contact with a school official who might reasonably be expected to know the borrower's address may be with someone other than the financial aid administrator, and may be in writing or by phone calls. These efforts must be completed by the date of default with no gap of more than 45 days between attempts to contact those individuals or entities.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon receipt of information indicating that it does not know the borrower's current address, the lender must discontinue the collection efforts described in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section.</P>

To reverse the presumption, the guaranty agency must present evidence that the activities or payments were provided for a reason unrelated to securing applications for FFEL loans or securing FFEL loan volume.

              <P>(2) A guaranty agency must require the return to the agency or the Secretary of Federal funds or assets within the meaning of section 422(g)(1) of the Act held by or under the control of any other entity that the Secretary determines are necessary to pay the program expenses and contingent liabilities of the agency or that are required for the orderly termination of the guaranty agency's operations and the liquidation of its assets.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Return of unnecessary Federal funds.</E> (1) The Secretary may initiate a process to recover unnecessary Federal funds under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the Secretary determines that a guaranty agency's Federal Fund ratio under § 682.410(a)(10) for each of the two preceding Federal fiscal years exceeded 2.0 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary initiates a process to recover unnecessary Federal funds, the Secretary requires the return of a portion of the Federal funds that the Secretary determines will permit the agency to—</P>
              <P>(i) Have a Federal Fund ratio of at least 2.0 percent under § 682.410(a)(10) at the time of the determination; and</P>

If the Secretary has directed the guaranty agency to require the return of Federal funds or assets held by or under the control of another entity, the guaranty agency must ensure that the agency's claims to those funds or assets and the collectability of the agency's claims will not be compromised or jeopardized during an appeal.

              <P>(ii) The agency may not submit new evidence at or after the oral argument unless the deciding official determines otherwise. A transcript of the oral argument is made a part of the record of the appeal and is promptly provided to the agency.</P>
              <P>(6) The guaranty agency has the burden of production and the burden of persuading the deciding official that the Secretary's determination should be modified or withdrawn.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Third-party participation.</E> (1) If the Secretary issues a determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary promptly publishes a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing the portion of the Federal Fund to be returned by the agency and providing interested persons an opportunity to submit written information relating to the determination within 30 days after the date of publication. The Secretary <PRTPAGE P="200"/>publishes the notice no earlier than five days after the agency receives a copy of the determination.</P>

              <P>(2) If the guaranty agency to which the determination relates files a notice of appeal of the determination, the deciding official may consider any information submitted in response to the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice. All information submitted by a third party is available for inspection and copying at the offices of the Department of Education in Washington, D.C., during normal business hours.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Adverse information.</E> If the deciding official considers information in addition to the evidence described in the notice of the Secretary's determination that is adverse to the guaranty agency's position on appeal, the deciding official informs the agency and provides it a reasonable opportunity to respond to the information without regard to the period referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Decision.</E> (1) The deciding official issues a written decision on the guaranty agency's appeal within 45 days of the date on which the information described in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section is received, or the oral argument referred to in paragraph (d)(5) of this section is held, whichever is later. The deciding official mails the decision to the guaranty agency by certified mail, return receipt requested. The decision of the deciding official becomes the final decision of the Secretary 30 days after the deciding official issues it. In the case of a determination that a guaranty agency must return Federal funds, if the deciding official does not issue a decision within the prescribed period, the agency is no longer required to take the actions described in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) A guaranty agency may not seek judicial review of the Secretary's determination to require the return of Federal funds or assets until the deciding official issues a decision.</P>
              <P>(3) The deciding official's written decision includes the basis for the decision. The deciding official bases the decision only on evidence described in the notice of the Secretary's determination and on information properly submitted and considered by the deciding official under this section. The deciding official is bound by all applicable statutes and regulations and may neither waive them nor rule them invalid.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Collection of Federal funds or assets.</E> (1) If the deciding official's final decision requires the guaranty agency to return Federal funds, or requires the guaranty agency to require the return of Federal funds or assets to the agency or to the Secretary, the decision states a new date for compliance with the decision. The new date is no earlier than the date on which the decision becomes the final decision of the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(2) If the guaranty agency fails to comply with the decision, the Secretary may recover the Federal funds from any funds due the agency from the Department without any further notice or procedure and may take any other action permitted or authorized by law to compel compliance.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Certification by a school that participated in the FFEL Program in connection with a loan application.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A school shall certify that the information it provides in connection with a loan application about the borrower and, in the case of a parent borrower, the student for whom the loan is intended, is complete and accurate. Except as provided in 34 CFR part 668, subpart E, a school may rely in good faith upon statements made by the borrower and, in the case of a parent borrower of a PLUS loan, the student and the parent borrower.</P>
              <P>(b) The information to be provided by the school about the borrower pertains to—</P>
              <P>(1) The borrower's eligibility for a loan, as determined in accordance with § 682.201 and § 682.204;</P>
              <P>(2) For a subsidized Stafford loan, the student's eligibility for interest benefits as determined in accordance with § 682.301; and</P>

              <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, in certifying a loan, a school must certify a loan for the lesser of the borrower's request or the loan limits determined under § 682.204.</P>
              <P>(d) Before certifying a PLUS loan application for a graduate or professional student borrower, the school must determine the borrower's eligibility for a Stafford loan. If the borrower is eligible for a Stafford loan but has not requested the maximum Stafford loan amount for which the borrower is eligible, the school must—</P>
              <P>(1) Notify the graduate or professional student borrower of the maximum Stafford loan amount that he or she is eligible to receive and provide the borrower with a comparison of—</P>
              <P>(i) The maximum interest rate for a Stafford loan and the maximum interest rate for a PLUS loan;</P>
              <P>(ii) Periods when interest accrues on a Stafford loan and periods when interest accrues on a PLUS loan; and</P>

              <P>(i) The student's estimated financial assistance for that period; and</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of a Subsidized Stafford loan, the borrower's expected family contribution for that period.</P>
              <P>(f)(1)(i) The minimum period of enrollment for which a school may certify a loan application is—</P>
              <P>(A) At a school that measures academic progress in credit hours and uses a semester, trimester, or quarter system, or has terms that are substantially equal in length with no term less than nine weeks in length, a single term (e.g., a semester or quarter); or</P>
              <P>(B) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, at a school that measures academic progress in clock hours, or measures academic progress in credit hours but does not use a semester, trimester, or quarter system and does not have terms that are substantially equal in length with no term less than nine weeks in length, the lesser of—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The length of the student's program (or the remaining portion of that program if the student has less than the full program remaining) at the school; or</P>

              <P>(ii) For a student who transfers into a school with credit or clock hours from another school, and the prior school certified or originated a loan for a period of enrollment that overlaps the period of enrollment at the new school, the new school may certify a loan for the remaining portion of the program or academic year. In this case the school may certify a loan for an amount that does not exceed the remaining balance of the student's annual loan limit.</P>
              <P>(iii) For a student who completes a program at a school, where the student's last loan to complete that program had been for less than an academic year, and the student then begins a new program at the same school, the school may certify a loan for the remainder of the academic year. In this case the school may certify a loan for an amount that does not exceed the remaining balance of the student's annual loan limit at the loan level associated with the new program.</P>
              <P>(2) May not, for first-time borrowers, assign through award packaging or other methods, a borrower's loan to a particular lender;</P>
              <P>(3) May refuse to certify a Stafford or PLUS loan or may reduce the borrower's determination of need for the loan if the reason for that action is documented and provided to the borrower in writing, provided that—</P>
              <P>(i) The determination is made on a case-by-case basis; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The documentation supporting the determination is retained in the student's file; and</P>
              <P>(4) May not, under paragraph (f)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, engage in any pattern or practice that results in a denial of a borrower's access to FFEL loans because of the borrower's race, sex, color, religion, national origin, age, handicapped status, income, or selection of a particular lender or guaranty agency.</P>
              <P>(g) The maximum period for which a school may certify a loan application is—</P>
              <P>(1) Generally an academic year, as defined by 34 CFR 668.3, except that a guaranty agency may allow a school to use a longer period of time, corresponding to the period to which the agency applies the annual loan limits; or</P>
              <P>(2) For a defaulted borrower who has regained eligibility under § 682.401(b)(1), the academic year in which the borrower regained eligibility.</P>

              <P>(4) In prorating a loan amount for a student enrolled in a program of study with less than a full academic year remaining, the school need not recalculate the amount of the loan if the number of hours for which an eligible student is enrolled changes after the school certifies the loan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Required exit counseling for borrowers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Exit counseling.</E> (1) A school must ensure that exit counseling is conducted with each Stafford Loan borrower and graduate or professional student PLUS Loan borrower either in person, by audiovisual presentation, or by interactive electronic means. In each case, the school must ensure that this counseling is conducted shortly before the student borrower ceases at least half-time study at the school, and that an individual with expertise in the title IV programs is reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer the student borrower's questions. As an alternative, in the case of a student borrower enrolled in a correspondence program or a study-abroad program that the home institution approves for credit, written counseling materials may be provided by mail within 30 days after the student borrower completes the program. If a student borrower withdraws from school without the school's prior knowledge or fails to complete an exit counseling session as required, the school must, within 30 days after learning that the student borrower has withdrawn from school or failed to complete the exit counseling as required, ensure that exit counseling is provided through interactive electronic means, by mailing written counseling materials to the student borrower at the student borrower's last known address, or by sending written counseling materials to an email address provided by the student borrower that is not an email address associated with the school sending the counseling materials.</P>
              <P>(2) The exit counseling must—</P>
              <P>(i) Inform the student borrower of the average anticipated monthly repayment amount based on the student borrower's indebtedness or on the average indebtedness of student borrowers who have obtained Stafford loans, PLUS Loans, or student borrowers who have obtained both Stafford and PLUS loans, depending on the types of loans the student borrower has obtained, for attendance at the same school or in the same program of study at the same school;</P>
              <P>(ii) Review for the student borrower available repayment plan options, including standard, graduated, extended, income sensitive and income-based repayment plans, including a description of the different features of each plan and sample information showing the average anticipated monthly payments, and the difference in interest paid and total payments under each plan;</P>
              <P>(iii) Explain to the borrower the options to prepay each loan, to pay each loan on a shorter schedule, and to change repayment plans;</P>
              <P>(iv) Provide information on the effects of loan consolidation including, at a minimum—</P>
              <P>(A) The effects of consolidation on total interest to be paid, fees to be paid, and length of repayment;</P>
              <P>(B) The effects of consolidation on a borrower's underlying loan benefits, including grace periods, loan forgiveness, cancellation, and deferment opportunities;</P>
              <P>(C) The options of the borrower to prepay the loan and to change repayment plans; and</P>
              <P>(D) That borrower benefit programs may vary among different lenders;</P>
              <P>(v) Include debt-management strategies that are designed to facilitate repayment;</P>
              <P>(vi) Explain to the borrower the use of a Master Promissory Note;</P>
              <P>(vii) Emphasize to the student borrower the seriousness and importance of the repayment obligation the borrower has assumed;</P>

              <P>(viii) Emphasize to the student borrower that the full amount of the loan (other than a loan made or originated <PRTPAGE P="206"/>by the school) must be repaid in full even if the student borrower does not complete the program, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain employment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services that the student borrower purchased from the school;</P>
              <P>(ix) Describe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures under Federal law, and litigation;</P>
              <P>(x) Provide—</P>
              <P>(A) A general description of the terms and conditions under which a borrower may obtain full or partial forgiveness or discharge of principal and interest, defer repayment of principal or interest, or be granted forbearance on a title IV loan, including forgiveness benefits or discharge benefits available to a FFEL borrower who consolidates his or her loan into the Direct Loan program; and</P>
              <P>(B) A copy, either in print or by electronic means, of the information the Secretary makes available pursuant to section 485(d) of the HEA;</P>
              <P>(xi) Require the student borrower to provide current information concerning name, address, social security number, references, and driver's license number and State of issuance, as well as the student borrower's expected permanent address, the address of the student borrower's next of kin, and the name and address of the student borrower's expected employer (if known). The school must ensure that this information is provided to the guaranty agency or agencies listed in the student borrower's records within 60 days after the student borrower provides the information;</P>
              <P>(xii) Review for the student borrower information on the availability of the Student Loan Ombudsman's office;</P>
              <P>(xiii) Inform the student borrower of the availability of title IV loan information in the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and how NSLDS can be used to obtain title IV loan status information; and</P>
              <P>(xiv) A general description of the types of tax benefits that may be available to borrowers.</P>
              <P>(3) If exit counseling is conducted by electronic interactive means, the school must take reasonable steps to ensure that each student borrower receives the counseling materials, and participates in and completes the counseling.</P>
              <P>(4) The school must maintain documentation substantiating the school's compliance with this section for each student borrower.</P>
              <P>(5)(i) For students who have received both FFEL Program and Direct Loan Program loans for attendance at a school, the school's compliance with the exit counseling requirements in 34 CFR 685.304(b) satisfies the requirements of this section if the school ensures that the exit counseling also provides the borrower with the information described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) A student's completion of electronic interactive exit counseling offered by the Secretary satisfies the requirements of this section, and for students who have also received Direct Loan Program loans for attendance at the school, the requirements of 34 CFR 685.304(b).</P>

The date is at least 15 days after receipt of the request from the lender or servicer. No proposed limitation or termination takes effect until a hearing is held.</P>
              <P>(3) The hearing is conducted by a presiding officer who—</P>

              <P>(4) The formal rules of evidence do not apply, and no discovery, as provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. appendix), is required.</P>

              <P>(6) If a termination action is brought against a lender or third-party servicer and the presiding officer concludes that a limitation is more appropriate, the presiding officer may issue a decision imposing one or more limitations on a lender or third-party servicer rather than terminating the lender's or servicer's eligibility.</P>
              <P>(7) In a termination action against a lender or third-party servicer based on a debarment under Executive Order 12549 or under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4 that does not meet the standards described in 2 CFR 3485.612(d), the presiding official finds that the debarment constitutes prima facie evidence that cause for debarment and termination under this subpart exists.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) Disqualification by the Secretary continues until the Secretary is satisfied that—</P>
              <P>(i) The lender has corrected the failure that led to the limitation, suspension, or termination; and</P>
              <P>(ii) There are reasonable assurances that the lender will comply with the requirements of the FFEL programs in the future.</P>
              <P>(2) Revocation of disqualification by the Secretary does not remove any limitation, suspension, or termination imposed by the agency whose action resulted in the disqualification.</P>

              <P>(d) A guaranty agency shall refer a limitation, suspension, or termination action that it takes against a lender to the Secretary within 30 days of its final decision to limit, suspend, or terminate <PRTPAGE P="215"/>the lender's eligibility to participate in the agency's program.</P>
              <P>(e) The Secretary reviews an agency's limitation, suspension, or termination of a lender's eligibility only when the guaranty agency's action is final, e.g, the lender is not entitled to any further appeals within the guaranty agency. A subsequent court challenge to an agency's action does not by itself affect the timing of the Secretary's review.</P>
              <P>(f) The guaranty agency's notice to the Secretary regarding a termination action must include a certified copy of the administrative record compiled by the agency with regard to the action. The record must include certified copies of the following documents:</P>
              <P>(1) The guaranty agency's letter initiating the action.</P>
              <P>(2) The lender's response.</P>

              <P>(8) All other documents relevant to the action.</P>
              <P>(g) The guaranty agency's referral notice to the Secretary regarding a limitation or suspension action must include—</P>
              <P>(1) The documents described in paragraph (f) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) Documents describing and substantiating the existence of one or more of the circumstances described in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) Within 60 days of the Secretary's receipt of a referral notice described in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, the Secretary makes an initial assessment, based on the agency's record, as to whether the agency's action appears to comply with section 428(b)(1)(U) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of a referral notice described in paragraph (g) of this section, the Secretary also determines whether one or more of the circumstances described in paragraph (i) of this section exist.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Secretary concludes that the agency's action appears to comply with section 428(b)(1)(U) of the Act and, if applicable, one or more of the circumstances described in paragraph (i) of this section exist, the Secretary notifies the lender that the Secretary will review the guaranty agency's action to determine whether to disqualify the lender from further participation in the FFEL programs and affords the lender an opportunity—</P>
              <P>(i) To waive the review and be disqualified immediately; or</P>
              <P>(ii) To request a review.</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of an action by an agency that limits or suspends a lender's eligibility to participate in the agency's program, the agency shall provide the Secretary with a referral as described in paragraph (g) of this section only if—</P>
              <P>(1) The lender has not corrected the violation. A violation is corrected if, among other things, the lender has satisfied fully all liabilities incurred by the lender as a result of the violation, including its liability to the Secretary, or the lender has arranged to satisfy those liabilities in a manner acceptable to the parties to whom the liabilities are owed;</P>
              <P>(2) The lender has not provided satisfactory assurances to the agency of future compliance with program requirements; or</P>
              <P>(3) The guaranty agency determines that special circumstances warrant disqualification of the lender from the FFEL programs for a significant period, notwithstanding the agency's decision not to terminate the lender's eligibility to participate in the agency's program.</P>

              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>The following is a reprint of Bulletin 88-G-138, issued on March 11, 1988, with modifications made to reflect changes in the program regulations. For a loan that has lost reinsurance prior to December 1, 1992, this policy applies only through November 30, 1995. For a loan that loses reinsurance on or after December 1, 1992, this policy applies until 3 years after the default claim filing deadline. For the purpose of determining the 3-year deadline, reinsurance is lost on the later of (a) 3 years from the last date the claim could have been filed for claim payment with the guaranty agency for a claim that was not filed; or (b) 3 years from the date the guaranty agency rejected the claim, for a claim that was filed. These deadlines are extended by periods during which collection activities are suspended due to the filing of a bankruptcy petition.</P>
              </NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Introduction</HD>
              <P>(1) This letter sets forth the circumstances under which the Secretary, pursuant to sections 432(a)(5) and (6) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and 34 CFR 682.406(b) and 682.413(f), will waive certain of the Secretary's rights and claims with respect to Stafford Loans, PLUS, Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), and Consolidation Program loans made under a guaranty agency program that involve violations of Federal regulations pertaining to due diligence in collection or timely filing. (These programs are collectively referred to in this letter as the FFEL Program.) This policy applies to due diligence violations on loans for which the first day of delinquency occurred on or after March 10, 1987 (the effective date of the November 10, 1986 due diligence regulations) and to timely filing violations occurring on or after December 26, 1986, whether or not the affected loans have been submitted as claims to the guaranty agency.</P>

              <P>(2) The Secretary has been implementing a variety of regulatory and administrative actions to minimize defaults in the FFEL Program. As a part of this effort, the Secretary published final regulations on November 10, 1986, requiring lenders and guaranty agencies to undertake specific due diligence activities to collect delinquent and defaulted loans, and establishing deadlines for the filing of claims by lenders with guaranty agencies. In recognition of the time required for agencies and lenders to modify their internal procedures, the Secretary delayed for four months the date by which lenders were required to comply with the new due diligence requirements. Thus, § 682.411 of the regulations, which established minimum due diligence procedures that a lender must follow in order for a guaranty agency to receive reinsurance on a loan, became effective for loans for which the first day of delinquency occurred on or after March 10, 1987. The regulations make clear that compliance with these minimum requirements, and with the new timely filing deadlines, is a condition for an agency's receiving or retaining reinsurance payments made by the Secretary on a loan. <E T="03">See</E> 34 CFR 682.406(a)(3), (a)(5), (a)(6), and 682.413(b). The regulations also specify that a lender must comply with § 682.411 and with the applicable filing deadline as a condition for its right to receive or retain interest benefits and special allowance on a loan for certain periods. <E T="03">See</E> 34 CFR 682.300(b)(2)(vii), 682.302(d)(1)(iv), 682.413(a)(1).</P>

              <P>(3) The Department has received inquiries regarding the procedures by which a lender may cure a violation of § 682.411 regarding diligent loan collection, or of the 90-day deadline for the filing of default claims found in § 682.406(a)(3) and (a)(5), in order to reinstate the agency's right to reinsurance and the lender's right to interest benefits and special allowance. Preliminarily, please note that, absent an exercise of the Secretary's waiver authority, a guaranty agency may not receive or retain reinsurance payments on a loan on which the lender has violated the Federal due diligence or timely filing requirements, even if the lender has followed a cure procedure established by the agency. Under §§ 682.406(b) and 682.413(f), the Secretary—not the guaranty agency—decides whether to reinstate reinsurance coverage on a loan involving such a violation or any other violation of Federal regulations. A lender's violation of a guaranty agency's requirement that affects the agency's guarantee coverage also affects reinsurance coverage. <E T="03">See</E> §§ 682.406(a)(7) and 682.413(b). As §§ 682.406(a)(7) and 682.413(b) make clear, a guaranty agency's cure procedures are relevant to reinsurance coverage only insofar as they allow for cure of violations of requirements established by the agency affecting the loan insurance it provides to lenders. In addition, all those requirements must be submitted to the Secretary for review and approval under 34 CFR 682.401(c).<PRTPAGE P="217"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) References throughout this letter to “due diligence and timely filing” rules, requirements, and violations should be understood to mean only the Federal rules cited above, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Scope</HD>
              <P>This letter outlines the Secretary's waiver policy regarding certain violations of Federal due diligence or timely filing requirements on a loan insured by a guaranty agency. Unless your agency receives notification to the contrary, or the lender's violation involves fraud or other intentional misconduct, you may treat as reinsured any otherwise reinsured loan involving such a violation that has been cured in accordance with this letter.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. Duty of a Guaranty Agency To Enforce Its Standards</HD>
              <P>As noted above, a lender's violation of a guaranty agency's requirement that affects the agency's guarantee coverage also affects reinsurance coverage. Thus, as a general rule, an agency that fails to enforce such a requirement and pays a default claim involving a violation is not eligible to receive reinsurance on the underlying loan. However, in light of the waiver policy outlined below, which provides more stringent cure procedures for violations occurring on or after May 1, 1988 than for pre-May 1, 1988 violations, some guaranty agencies with more stringent policies than the policy outlined below for the pre-May 1 violations have indicated that they wish to relax their own policies for violations of agency rules during that period. While the Secretary does not encourage any agency to do so, the Secretary will permit an agency to take either of the following approaches to its enforcement of its own due diligence and timely filing rules for violations occurring before May 1, 1988.</P>
              <P>(1) The agency may continue to enforce its rules, even if they result in the denial of guarantee coverage by the agency on otherwise reinsurable loans; or</P>
              <P>(2) The agency may decline to enforce its rules as to any loan that would be reinsured under the retrospective waiver policy outlined below. In other words, for violations of a guaranty agency's due diligence and timely filing rules occurring before May 1, 1988, a guaranty agency is authorized, but not required, to retroactively revise its own due diligence and timely filing standards to treat as guaranteed any loan amount that is reinsured under the retrospective enforcement policy outlined in section I.C.1. However, for any violation of an agency's due diligence or timely filing rules occurring on or after May 1, 1988, the agency must resume enforcing those rules in accordance with their terms, in order to receive reinsurance payments on the underlying loan. For these post-April 30 violations, and for any other violation of an agency's rule affecting its guarantee coverage, the Secretary will treat as reinsured all loans on which the agency has engaged in, and documented, a case-by-case exercise of reasonable discretion allowing for guarantee coverage to be continued or reinstated notwithstanding the violation. But any agency that otherwise fails, or refuses, to enforce such a rule does so without the benefit of reinsurance coverage on the affected loans, and the lenders continue to be ineligible for interest benefits and special allowance thereon.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">C. Due Diligence</HD>

              <P>Under 34 CFR 682.200, default on a FFEL Program loan occurs when a borrower fails to make a payment when due, provided this failure persists for 270 days for loans payable in monthly installments, or for 330 days for loans payable in less frequent installments. The 270/330-day default period applies regardless of whether payments were missed consecutively or intermittently. For example, if the borrower, on a loan payable in monthly installments, makes his January 1st payment on time, his February 1st payment two months late (April 1st), his March 1st payment 3 months late (June 1st), and makes no further payments, the delinquency period begins on February 2nd, with the first delinquency, and default occurs on December 27th, when the April payment becomes 270 days past due. The lender must treat the payment made on April 1st as the February 1st payment, since the February 1st payment had not been made prior to that time. Similarly, the lender must treat the payment made on June 1st as the March 1st payment, since the March payment had not been made prior to that time.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

                <P>Lenders are strongly encouraged to exercise forbearance, prior to default, for the benefit of borrowers who have missed payments intermittently but have otherwise indicated willingness to repay their loans. <E T="03">See</E> 34 CFR 682.211. The forbearance process helps to reduce the incidence of default, and serves to emphasize for the borrower the importance of compliance with the repayment obligation.</P>
              </NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">D. Timely Filing</HD>

              <P>(1) The 90-day filing period applicable to FFEL Program default claims is described in 34 CFR 682.406(a)(5). The 90-day filing period begins at the end of the 270/330-day default period. The lender ordinarily must file a default claim on a loan in default by the end of the filing period. However, the lender may, but need not, file a claim on that loan before the 360th day of delinquency (270-day default period plus 90-day filing period) if the borrower brings the account less than 270 days <PRTPAGE P="218"/>delinquent before the 360th day. Thus, in the above example, if the borrower makes the April 1st payment on December 28th, that payment makes the loan 241 days delinquent, and the lender may, but need not, file a default claim on the loan at that time. If, however, the loan again becomes 270 days delinquent, the lender must file a default claim within 90 days thereafter (unless the loan is again brought to less than 270 days delinquent prior to the end of that 90-day period). In other words, the Secretary will permit a lender to treat payments made during the filing period as curing the default if those payments are sufficient to make the loan less than 270 days delinquent.</P>
              <P>(2) Section I of this letter outlines the Secretary's waiver policy for due diligence and timely filing violations. As noted above, to the extent that it results in the imposition of a lesser sanction than that available to the Secretary by statute or regulation, this policy reflects the exercise of the Secretary's authority to waive the Secretary's rights and claims in this area. Section II discusses the issue of the due date of the first payment on a loan and the application of the waiver policy to that issue. Section III provides guidance on several issues related to due diligence and timely filing as to which clarification has been requested by some program participants.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Waiver Policy</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Definitions</HD>
              <P>The following definitions apply to terms used throughout this letter:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Full payment</E> means payment by the borrower, or another person (other than the lender) on the borrower's behalf, in an amount at least as great as the monthly payment amount required under the existing terms of the loan, exclusive of any forbearance agreement in force at the time of the default. (For example, if the original repayment schedule or agreement called for payments of $50 per month, but a forbearance agreement was in effect at the time of default that allowed the borrower to pay $25 per month for a specified time, and the borrower defaulted in making the reduced payments, a full payment would be $50, or two $25 payments in accordance with the original repayment schedule or agreement.) In the case of a payment made by cash, money order, or other means that do not identify the payor that is received by a lender after the date of this letter, that payment may constitute a full payment only if a senior officer of the lender or servicing agent certifies that the payment was not made by or on behalf of the lender or servicing agent.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Earliest unexcused violation</E> means:</P>
              <P>(a) In cases when reinsurance is lost due to a failure to timely establish a first payment due date, the earliest unexcused violation would be the 46th day after the date the first payment due date should have been established.</P>
              <P>(b) In cases when reinsurance is lost due to a gap of 46 days, the earliest unexcused violation date would be the 46th day following the last collection activity.</P>
              <P>(c) In cases when reinsurance is lost due to three or more due diligence violations of 6 days or more, the earliest unexcused violation would be the day after the date of default.</P>
              <P>(d) In cases when reinsurance is lost due to a timely filing violation, the earliest unexcused violation would be the day after the filing deadline.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Reinstatement</E> with respect to reinsurance coverage means the reinstatement of the guaranty agency's right to receive reinsurance payments on the loan after the date of reinstatement. Upon reinstatement of reinsurance, the borrower regains the right to receive forbearance or deferments, as appropriate. Reinstatement with respect to reinsurance on a loan also includes reinstatement of the lender's right to receive interest and special allowance payments on that loan.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Gap in collection activity</E> on a loan means:</P>
              <P>(a) The period between the initial delinquency and the first collection activity;</P>
              <P>(b) The period between collection activities (a request for preclaims assistance is considered a collection activity);</P>
              <P>(c) The period between the last collection activity and default; or</P>

              <P>(d) The period between the date a lender discovers a borrower has “skipped” and the lender's first skip-tracing activity.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>The concept of “gap” is used herein simply as one measure of collection activity. This definition applies to loans subject to the FFEL and PLUS programs regulations published on or after November 10, 1986. For those loans, not all gaps are violations of the due diligence rules.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>
                <E T="03">Violation</E> with respect to the due diligence requirements in § 682.411 means the failure to timely complete a required diligent phone contact effort, the failure to timely send a required letter (including a request for preclaims assistance), or the failure to timely engage in a required skip-tracing activity. If during the delinquency period a gap of more than 45 days occurs (more than 60 days for loans with a transfer), the lender must satisfy the requirement outlined in I.D.1. for reinsurance to be reinstated. The day after the 45-day gap (or 60 for loans with a transfer) will be considered the date that the violation occurred.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Transfer</E> means any action, including, but not limited to, the sale of the loan, that results in a change in the system used to monitor or conduct collection activity on a loan from one system to another.<PRTPAGE P="219"/>

                <E T="03">1. Resumption of Interest and Special Allowance Billing on Loans Involving Due Diligence or Timely Filing Violations.</E> For any loan on which a cure is required under this letter in order for the agency to receive any reinsurance payment, the lender may resume billing for interest and special allowance on the loan only for periods following its completion of the required cure procedure.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">2. Reservation of the Secretary's Right to Strict Enforcement.</E> While this letter describes the Secretary's general waiver policy, the Secretary retains the option of refusing to permit or recognize cures, or of insisting on strict enforcement of the remedies established by statute or regulation, in cases where, in the Secretary's judgment, a lender has committed an excessive number of severe violations of due diligence or timely filing rules and in cases where the best interests of the United States otherwise require strict enforcement. More generally, this bulletin states the Secretary's general policy and is not intended to limit in any way the authority and discretion afforded the Secretary by statute or regulation.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">3. Interest, Special Allowance, and Reinsurance Repayment Required as a Condition for Exercise of the Secretary's Waiver Authority.</E> The Secretary's waiver of the right to recover or refuse to pay reinsurance, interest benefits, or special allowance payments, and recognition of cures for due diligence and timely filing violations, are conditioned on the following:</P>
              <P>a. The guaranty agency and lender must ensure that the lender repays all interest benefits and special allowance received on loans involving violations occurring prior to May 1, 1988, for which the lender is ineligible under the waiver policy for the “retrospective period” described in section I.C.1., or under the waiver policy for timely filing violations described in section I.E.1., by an adjustment to one of the next three quarterly billings for interest benefits and special allowance submitted by the lender in a timely manner after May 1, 1988. The guaranty agency's responsibility in this regard is satisfied by receipt of a certification from the lender that this repayment has been made in full.</P>
              <P>b. The guaranty agency, on or before October 1, 1988, must repay all reinsurance received on loans involving violations occurring prior to May 1, 1988, for which the agency is ineligible under the waiver policy for the “retrospective period” described in section I.C.1., or under the waiver policy for timely filing violations described in section I.E.1. Pending completion of the repayment described above, a lender or guaranty agency may submit billings to the Secretary on loans that are eligible for reinsurance under the waiver policy in this letter until it learns that repayment in full will not be made, or until the deadline for a repayment has passed without it being made, whichever is earlier. Of course, a lender or guaranty agency is prohibited from billing the Secretary for program payments on any loan amount that is not eligible for reinsurance under the waiver policy outlined in this letter. In addition to the repayments required above, any amounts received in the future in violation of this prohibition must immediately be repaid to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">4. Applicability of the Waiver Policy to Particular Classes of Loans.</E> The policy outlined in this letter applies only to a loan for which the first day of the 180/240-day or 270/330-day default period (as applicable) that ended with default by the borrower occurred on or after March 10, 1987, or, in the case of a timely filing violation, December 26, 1986, and that involves violations only of the due diligence or timely filing requirements or both. For a loan that has lost reinsurance prior to December 1, 1992, this policy applies only through November 30, 1995. For a loan that loses reinsurance on or after December 1, 1992, this policy applies until 3 years after the default claim filing deadline.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">5. Excuse of Certain Due Diligence Violations.</E> Except as noted in section II, if a loan has due diligence violations but was later cured and brought current, those violations will not be considered in determining whether a loan was serviced in accordance with 34 CFR 682.411. Guarantors must review the due diligence for the 180/240 or 270/330-day period (as applicable) prior to the default date ensuring the due date of the first payment not later made is the correct payment due date for the borrower.</P>

Excuse of Timely Filing Violations Due to Performance of a Guaranty Agency's Cure Procedures.</E> If, prior to May 1, 1988, and prior to the filing deadline, a lender commenced the performance of collection activities specifically required by the guaranty agency to cure a due diligence violation on a loan, the Secretary will excuse the lender's timely filing violation if the lender completes the additional activities within the time period permitted by the guaranty agency and files a default claim on the loan not more than 45 days after completing the additional activities.</P>

Treatment of Accrued Interest on “Cured” Claims.</E> For any loan involving any violation of the due diligence or timely filing rules for which a “cure” is required under section I.C. or I.E., for the agency to receive a reinsurance payment, the Secretary will not reimburse the guaranty agency for any unpaid interest accruing after the date of the earliest unexcused violation occurring after the last payment received before the cure is accomplished, and prior to the date of reinstatement of reinsurance coverage. The lender may capitalize unpaid interest accruing on <PRTPAGE P="220"/>the loan from the date of the earliest unexcused violation to the date of the reinstatement of reinsurance coverage. However, if the agency later files a claim for reinsurance on that loan, the agency must deduct this capitalized interest from the amount of the claim. Some cures will not reinstate coverage. For treatment of accrued interest in those cases, see section I.E.1.c.</P>

              <P>A violation of the due diligence in collection rules occurs when a lender fails to meet the requirements found in 34 CFR 682.411. However, if a lender makes all required calls and sends all required letters during any of the delinquency periods described in that section, the lender is considered to be in compliance with that section for that period, even if the letters were sent before the calls were made. The special provisions for transfers apply whenever the violation(s) and, if applicable, the gap, were due to a transfer, as defined in section I.A.</P>

                <E T="03">1. Retrospective Period.</E> For one or more due diligence violations occurring during the period March 10, 1987-April 30, 1988—</P>
              <P>a. There will be no reduction or recovery by the Secretary of payments to the lender or guaranty agency if no gap of 46 days or more (61 days or more for a transfer) exists.</P>
              <P>b. If a gap of 46-60 days (61-75 days for a transfer) exists, principal will be reinsured, but accrued interest, interest benefits, and special allowance otherwise payable by the Secretary for the delinquency period are limited to amounts accruing through the date of default.</P>

              <P>c. If a gap of 61 days or more (76 days or more for a transfer) exists, the borrower must be located after the gap, either by the agency or the lender, in order for reinsurance on the loan to be reinstated. (<E T="03">See</E> section I.E.1.d., for a description of acceptable evidence of location.) In addition, if the loan is held by the lender or after March 15, 1988, the lender must follow the steps described in section I.E.1., or receive a full payment or a new signed repayment agreement, in order for the loan to again be eligible for reinsurance. The lender must repay all interest benefits and special allowance received for the period beginning with its earliest unexcused violation, occurring after the last payment received before the cure is accomplished, and ending with the date, if any, that reinsurance on the loan is reinstated.</P>

              <P>b. If there exist not more than two violations of 6 days or more each (21 days or more for a transfer), and no gap of 46 days or more (61 days or more for a transfer) exists, principal will be reinsured, but accrued interest, interest benefits, and special allowance otherwise payable by the Secretary for the delinquency period will be limited to amounts accruing through the date of default. However, the lender must complete all required activities before the claim filing deadline, except that a preclaims assistance request must be made before the 240th day of delinquency. If the lender fails to make this request by the 240th day, the Secretary will not pay any accrued interest, interest benefits, and special allowance for the most recent 180 days prior to default. If the lender fails to complete any other required activity before the claim filing deadline, accrued interest, interest benefits, and special allowance otherwise payable by the Secretary for the delinquency period will be limited to amounts accruing through the 90th day before default.</P>
              <P>c. If there exist three violations of 6 days or more each (21 days or more for a transfer) and no gap of 46 days or more (61 days or more for a transfer), the lender must satisfy the requirements outlined in I.E.1., or receive a full payment or a new signed repayment agreement in order for reinsurance on the loan to be reinstated. The Secretary does not pay any interest benefits or special allowance for the period beginning with the lender's earliest unexcused violation occurring after the last payment received before the cure is accomplished, and ending with the date, if any, that reinsurance on the loan is reinstated.</P>

              <P>b. If there exist not more than two violations of 6 days or more each (21 days or more for a transfer), and no gap of 46 days or more (61 days or more for a transfer) exists, principal will be reinsured, but accrued interest, <PRTPAGE P="221"/>interest benefits, and special allowance otherwise payable by the Secretary for the delinquency period will be limited to amounts accruing through the date of default. However, the lender must complete all required activities before the claim filing deadline, except that a default aversion assistance request must be made before the 330th day of delinquency. If the lender fails to make this request by the 330th day, the Secretary will not pay any accrued interest, interest benefits, and special allowance for the most recent 270 days prior to default. If the lender fails to complete any other required activity before the claim filing deadline, accrued interest, interest benefits, and special allowance otherwise payable by the Secretary for the delinquency period will be limited to amounts accruing through the 90th day before default.</P>

              <P>a. After the violations occur, the lender obtains a new repayment agreement signed by the borrower. The repayment agreement must comply with the repayment period limitations set out in 34 CFR 682.209(a)(8) and 682.209(h)(2); or</P>
              <P>b. After the violations occur, the lender obtains one full payment. If the borrower later defaults, the guaranty agency must obtain evidence of this payment (e.g., a copy of the check) from the lender.</P>

                <E T="03">a. Reinstatement of Insurance Coverage.</E> Except as noted in section I.B.6., in order to obtain reinstatement of reinsurance coverage on a loan in the case of a timely filing violation, a due diligence violation described in section I.C.2.c. or I.C.3.c., or a due diligence violation described in section I.C.1.c. where the lender holds the loan on or after March 15, 1988, the lender must first locate the borrower after the gap, or after the date of the last violation, as applicable. (<E T="03">See</E> section I.E.1.d. for description of acceptable evidence of location.) Within 15 days thereafter, the lender must send to the borrower, at the address at which the borrower was located, (i) a new repayment agreement, to be signed by the borrower, that complies with the ten-year repayment limitations in 34 CFR 682.209(a)(7), along with (ii) a collection letter indicating in strong terms the seriousness of the borrower's delinquency and its potential effect on his or her credit rating if repayment is not commenced or resumed. If, within 15 days after the lender sends these items, the borrower fails to make a full payment or to sign and return the new repayment agreement, the lender must, within 5 days thereafter, diligently attempt to contact the borrower by telephone. Within 5-10 days after completing these efforts, the lender must again diligently attempt to contact the borrower by telephone. Finally, within 5-10 days after completing these efforts, the lender must send a forceful collection letter indicating that the entire unpaid balance of the loan is due and payable, and that, unless the borrower immediately contacts the lender to arrange repayment, the lender will be filing a default claim with the guaranty agency.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">b. Borrower Deemed Current Under Certain Circumstances.</E> If, at any time on or before the 30th day after the lender completes the additional collection efforts described in section I.E.1.a., or the 270th day of delinquency, whichever is later, the lender receives a full payment or a new signed repayment agreement, reinsurance coverage on the loan is reinstated on the date the lender receives the full payment or new agreement. The borrower must be deemed by the lender to be <PRTPAGE P="222"/>current in repaying the loan and entitled to all rights and benefits available to borrowers who are not in default. In the case of a timely filing violation on a loan for which the borrower is deemed current under this paragraph, the lender is ineligible to receive interest benefits and special allowance accruing from the date of the violation to the date of reinstatement of reinsurance coverage on the loan.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">c. Borrower Deemed in Default Under Certain Circumstances.</E> If the borrower does not make a full payment, or sign and return the new repayment agreement, on or before the 30th day after the lender completes the additional collection efforts described in section I.E.1.a., or the 270th day of delinquency, whichever is later, the lender must deem the borrower to be in default. The lender must then file a default claim on the loan, accompanied by acceptable evidence of location (<E T="03">see</E> section I.E.1.d.), within 30 days after the end of the 30-day period. Reinsurance coverage, and therefore the lender's right to receive interest benefits and special allowance, is not reinstated on a loan involving these circumstances. However, the Secretary will honor reinsurance claims submitted in accordance with this paragraph on the outstanding principal balance of those loans, on unpaid interest as provided in section I.B.7., and for reimbursement of eligible supplemental preclaims assistance costs. In the case of a timely filing violation on a loan for which the borrower is deemed in default under this paragraph, the lender is ineligible to receive interest benefits and special allowance accruing from the date of the violation.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">d. Acceptable Evidence of Location.</E> Only the following documentation is acceptable as evidence that the lender has located the borrower:</P>
              <P>(1) A postal receipt signed by the borrower not more than 15 days prior to the date on which the lender sent the new repayment agreement, indicating acceptance of correspondence from the lender by the borrower at the address shown on the receipt; or</P>
              <P>(2) Documentation submitted by the lender showing—</P>
              <P>(i) The name, identification number, and address of the lender;</P>
              <P>(ii) The name and Social Security number of the borrower; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A signed certification by an employee or agent of the lender, that—</P>
              <P>(A) On a specified date, he or she spoke with or received written communication (attached to the certification) from the borrower on the loan underlying the default claim, or a parent, spouse, sibling, roommate, or neighbor of the borrower;</P>
              <P>(B) The address and, if available, telephone number of the borrower were provided to the lender in the telephone or written communication; and</P>
              <P>(C) In the case of a borrower whose address or telephone number was provided to the lender by someone other than the borrower, the new repayment agreement and the letter sent by the lender pursuant to section I.E.1.a., had not been returned undelivered as of 20 days after the date those items were sent, for due diligence violations described in section I.C.1.c. where the lender holds the loan on the date of this letter, and as of the date the lender filed a default claim on the cured loan, for all other violations.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">2. Death, Disability, and Bankruptcy Claims.</E> The Secretary will honor a death or disability claim on an otherwise eligible loan notwithstanding the lender's failure to meet the 60-day timely filing requirement (<E T="03">See</E> 34 CFR 682.402(g)(2)(i)). However, the Secretary will not reimburse the guaranty agency if, before the date the lender determined that the borrower died or was totally and permanently disabled, the lender had violated the Federal due diligence or timely filing requirements applicable to that loan, except in accordance with the waiver policy described above. Interest that accrued on the loan after the expiration of the 60-day filing period remains ineligible for reimbursement by the Secretary, and the lender must repay all interest and special allowance received on the loan for periods after the expiration of the 60-day filing period. The Secretary has determined that, in the vast majority of cases, the failure of a lender to comply with the timely filing requirement applicable to bankruptcy claims (§ 682.402(g)(2)(iv)) causes irreparable harm to the guaranty agency's ability to contest the discharge of the loan by the court, or to otherwise collect from the borrower. Therefore, the Secretary has decided not to excuse violations of the timely filing requirement applicable to bankruptcy claims, except when the lender can demonstrate that the bankruptcy action has concluded and that the loan has not been discharged in bankruptcy or, if previously discharged, has been the subject of a reversal of the discharge. In that case, the lender must return the borrower to the appropriate status that existed prior to the filing of the bankruptcy claim unless the status has changed due solely to passage of time. In the latter case, the lender must place the borrower in the status that would exist had no bankruptcy claim been filed. If the borrower is delinquent after the loan is determined nondischargeable, the lender should grant administrative forbearance to bring the borrower's account current as provided in § 682.211(f)(4) and § 682.402(f)(5)(ii) and (f)(6). The Secretary will not reimburse the guaranty agency for interest for the period beginning on the filing deadline for the bankruptcy claim and ending on the date the loan becomes eligible again for reinsurance. Reinsurance is reinstated on the date the bankruptcy action concludes and the loan is not <PRTPAGE P="223"/>discharged or on the date a previous discharge is reversed.</P>
              <P>II. <E T="03">Due Date of First Payment.</E> Section 682.411(b)(1) refers to the “due date of the first missed payment not later made” as one way to determine the first day of delinquency on a loan. Section 682.209(a)(3) states that, generally, the repayment period on an FFEL Program loan begins some number of months after the month in which the borrower ceases at least half-time study. Where the borrower enters the repayment period with the lender's knowledge, the first payment due date may be set by the lender, provided it falls within a reasonable time after the first day of the month in which the repayment period begins. In this situation, the Secretary generally permits a lender to allow the borrower up to 45 days from the first day of repayment to make the first payment (unless the lender establishes the first day of repayment under § 682.209(a)(3)(ii)(E)).</P>
              <P>1. In cases where the lender learns that the borrower has entered the repayment period after the fact, current § 682.411 treats the 30th day after the lender receives this information as the first day of delinquency. In the course of discussion with lenders, the Secretary has learned that many lenders have not been using the 30th day after receipt of notice that the repayment period has begun (“the notice”) as the first payment due date. In recognition of this apparently widespread practice, the Secretary has decided that, both retrospectively and prospectively, a lender should be allowed to establish a first payment due date within 60 days after receipt of the notice, to capitalize interest accruing up to the first payment due date, and to exercise forbearance with respect to the period during which the borrower was in the repayment period but made no payment. In effect, this means that, if the lender sends the borrower a coupon book, billing notice, or other correspondence establishing a new first payment due date, on or before the 60th day after receipt of the notice, the lender is deemed to have exercised forbearance up to the new first payment due date. The new first payment due date must fall no later than 75 days after receipt of the notice (unless the lender establishes the first day of repayment under § 682.209(a)(3)(ii)(E)). In keeping with the 5-day tolerance permitted under section I.C.2.a., for the “prospective period,” or section I.C.3.a., for the “post 1998 amendment period,” a lender that sends the above-described material on or before the 65th day after receipt of the notice will be held harmless. However, a lender that does so on the 66th day will have failed by more than 5 days to send both of the collection letters required by § 682.411(c) to be sent within the first 30 days of delinquency and will thus have committed two violations of more than five days of that rule.</P>
              <P>2. If the lender fails to send the material establishing a new first payment due date on or before the 65th day after receipt of the notice, it may thereafter send material establishing a new first payment due date falling not more than 45 days after the materials are sent and will be deemed to have exercised forbearance up to the new first payment due date. However, all violations and gaps occurring prior to the date on which the material is sent are subject to the waiver policies described in section I for violations falling in either the retrospective or prospective periods. This is an exception to the general policy set forth in section I.B.5., that only violations occurring during the most recent 180 or 270 days (as applicable) of the delinquency period on a loan are relevant to the Secretary's examination of due diligence.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Please Note:</E> References to the “65th day after receipt of the notice” and “66th day” in the preceding paragraphs should be amended to read “95th day” and “96th day” respectively for lenders subject to § 682.209(a)(3)(ii)(E).</P>
              <P>III. <E T="03">Questions and Answers</E>
              </P>
              <P>The waiver policy outlined in this letter was developed after extensive discussion and consultation with participating lenders and guaranty agencies. In the course of these discussions, lenders and agencies raised a number of questions regarding the due diligence rules as applied to various circumstances. The Secretary's responses to these questions follow.</P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>The answer to questions 1 and 4 are applicable only to loans subject to § 682.411 of the FFEL and PLUS program regulations published on or after November 10, 1986.</P>
              </NOTE>
              <P>
                <E T="03">1. Q:</E> Section 682.411 of the program regulations requires the lender to make “diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone” during each 30-day period of delinquency beginning after the 30th day of delinquency. What must a lender do to comply with this requirement?</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">A:</E> Generally speaking, one actual telephone contact with the borrower, or two attempts to make such contact on different days and at different times, will satisfy the “diligent efforts” requirement for any of the 30-day delinquency periods described in the rule. However, the “diligent efforts” requirement is intended to be a flexible one, requiring the lender to act on information it receives in the course of attempting telephone contact regarding the borrower's actual telephone number, the best time to call to reach the borrower, etc. For instance, if the lender is told during its second telephone contact attempt that the borrower can be reached at another number or at a different time of day, the lender must then attempt to reach the borrower by telephone at that number or that time of day.<PRTPAGE P="224"/>
              </P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">2. Q:</E> What must a lender do when it receives conflicting information regarding the date a borrower ceased at least half-time study?</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">A:</E> A lender must promptly attempt to reconcile conflicting information regarding a borrower's in-school status by making inquiries of appropriate parties, including the borrower's school. Pending reconciliation, the lender may rely on the most recent credible information it has.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">3. Q:</E> If a loan is transferred from one lender to another, is the transferee held responsible for information regarding the borrower's status that is received by the transferor but is not passed on to the transferee?</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">A:</E> No. A lender is responsible only for information received by its agents and employees. However, if the transferee has reason to believe that the transferor has received additional information regarding the loan, the transferee must make a reasonable inquiry of the transferor as to the nature and substance of that information.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">4. Q:</E> What are a lender's due diligence responsibilities where a check received on a loan is dishonored by the bank on which it was drawn?</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">A:</E> Upon receiving notice that a check has been dishonored, the lender must treat the payment as having never been made for purposes of determining the number of days that the borrower is delinquent at that time. The lender must then begin (or resume) attempting collection on the loan in accordance with § 682.411, commencing with the first 30-day delinquency period described in § 682.411 that begins after the 30-day delinquency period in which the notice of dishonor is received. The same result occurs when the lender successfully obtains a delinquent borrower's correct address through skip-tracing, or when a delinquent borrower leaves deferment or forbearance status.</P>

The Secretary makes loans under the following program components:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan Program (Direct Subsidized Loan Program), which provides loans to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. Loans made under this program are referred to as Direct Subsidized Loans. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the Secretary subsidizes the interest while the borrower is in an in-school, grace, or deferment period. Graduate and professional students are not eligible to receive Direct Subsidized Loans for any period of enrollment beginning on or after July 1, 2012.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary does not subsidize the interest that accrues during the grace period on any Direct Subsidized Loan for which the first disbursement is made on or after July 1, 2012 and before July 1, 2014.</P>
              <P>(2) Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan Program (Direct Unsubsidized Loan Program), which provides loans to undergraduate, graduate and professional students. Loans made under this program are referred to as Direct Unsubsidized Loans. The borrower is responsible for the interest that accrues during any period.</P>
              <P>(3) Federal Direct PLUS Program (Direct PLUS Loan Program), which provides loans to parents of dependent students and to graduate or professional students. Loans made under this program are referred to as Direct PLUS Loans. The borrower is responsible for the interest that accrues during any period.</P>
              <P>(4) Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program (Direct Consolidation Loan Program), which provides loans to borrowers to consolidate certain Federal educational loans. Loans made under this program are referred to as Direct Consolidation Loans.</P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary makes a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or a Direct PLUS Loan only to a student or a parent of a student enrolled in a school that participates in the Direct Loan Program.</P>
              <P>(c) The Secretary makes a Direct Consolidation Loan only to a borrower who is consolidating at least one loan made under the Direct Loan Program or the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program.</P>

Such a borrower may still receive Direct Unsubsidized Loans for which the borrower is otherwise eligible.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Borrower responsibility for accruing interest.</E> (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this part that provides for the borrower to not be responsible for accruing interest on a Direct Subsidized Loan or on the portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan that repaid a Direct Subsidized Loan, and except as provided in paragraphs (f)(6)(v) and (f)(7)(iv) of this section, a first-time borrower becomes responsible for the interest that accrues on a previously received Direct Subsidized Loan or on the portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan that repaid a Direct Subsidized Loan beginning on the date—</P>
              <P>(A) The borrower has no remaining eligibility period; and</P>
              <P>(B) The borrower attends any undergraduate program or preparatory coursework on at least a half-time basis at an eligible institution that participates in the title IV, HEA programs.</P>

              <P>(ii) For a first-time borrower who is enrolled on a half-time or three-quarter-time basis, the borrower's prorated subsidized usage period is calculated by multiplying the borrower's subsidized usage period by 0.5 or 0.75, respectively.</P>
              <P>(iii) For a first-time borrower who receives a closed school, false certification, unpaid refund, or defense to repayment discharge on a Direct Subsidized Loan or a portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan that is attributable to a Direct Subsidized Loan, the Subsidized Usage Period is reduced. If the Direct Subsidized Loan or a portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan that is attributable to a Direct Subsidized Loan is discharged in full, the Subsidized Usage Period of those loans is zero years. If the Direct Subsidized Loan or a portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan that is attributable to a Direct Subsidized Loan is discharged in part, the Subsidized Usage Period may be reduced if the discharge results in the inapplicability of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Subsequent attendance in programs of greater duration.</E> A first-time borrower who subsequently attends a program that is longer than the program the borrower previously attended—</P>

              <P>(iv) For enrollment in preparatory coursework necessary for enrollment in an undergraduate program, the borrower becomes responsible for accruing interest as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section only if the borrower has no remaining eligibility period in the program for which the coursework is required; and</P>
              <P>(v) Enrollment in preparatory coursework necessary for enrollment in a graduate or professional program does not result in a borrower becoming responsible for accruing interest as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iii) For purposes of determining a borrower's remaining eligibility period for programs other than a teacher certification program for which an institution does not award an academic credential, any Direct Subsidized Loans that the borrower received for enrollment in such a teacher certification program are not included in a borrower's subsidized usage period; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Enrollment in such a teacher certification program does not result in a borrower becoming responsible for accruing interest on any Direct Subsidized Loan under paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Special admission degree programs.</E> (i) For purposes of calculating the maximum eligibility period, a bachelor's degree program that requires an associate degree or the successful completion of at least two years of postsecondary coursework as a prerequisite for admission has a program length of four years.</P>

              <P>(ii) In the case of a military service deferment under paragraph (h) of this section, a borrower's representative may request the deferment and provide the required information and documents on behalf of the borrower. If the Secretary grants a military service deferment based on a request from a borrower's representative, the Secretary notifies the borrower that the deferment has been granted and that the borrower has the option to cancel the deferment and continue to make payments on the loan. The Secretary may also notify the borrower's representative of the outcome of the deferment request.<PRTPAGE P="247"/>

              <P>(ii) The Secretary will grant a deferment based on the information obtained under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section when determining a borrower's eligibility for a deferment, unless the Secretary, as of the date of the determination, has information indicating that the borrower does not qualify for the deferment. The Secretary will resolve any discrepant information before granting a deferment under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the Secretary grants a deferment under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the Secretary notifies the borrower that the deferment has been granted and that the borrower has the option to cancel the deferment and continue to make payments on the loan.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the borrower elects to cancel the deferment and continue to make payments on the loan, the borrower has the option to make the principal and interest payments that were deferred.

              <P>(C) Is structured in a way that requires a substantial commitment by the borrower to his or her rehabilitation.

For the purpose of this paragraph, full-time employment involves at least 30 hours of work per week and is expected to last at least three months.</P>

              <P>(i) Three years from the end of the last award year in which the student attended the institution; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The limitation period that State law would apply to an action by the borrower to recover on the cause of action on which the borrower defense is based.</P>
              <P>(4) The Secretary may initiate a proceeding to collect at any time if the institution received notice of the claim before the end of the later of the periods described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, notice includes receipt of—</P>
              <P>(i) Actual notice from the borrower, from a representative of the borrower, or from the Department;</P>
              <P>(ii) A class action complaint asserting relief for a class that may include the borrower; and</P>

              <P>(5) Provisions governing the income-contingent repayment plans are in § 685.209.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Alternative repayment.</E> (1) The Secretary may provide an alternative repayment plan for a borrower who demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the terms and conditions of the repayment plans specified in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section are not adequate to accommodate the borrower's exceptional circumstances.<PRTPAGE P="260"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary may require a borrower to provide evidence of the borrower's exceptional circumstances before permitting the borrower to repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Secretary agrees to permit a borrower to repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of the terms of the plan.

              <P>(5) If the amount of a borrower's monthly payment under an alternative repayment plan is less than the accrued interest on the loan, the unpaid interest is capitalized until the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than the original principal amount. After the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than the original principal amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized. For purposes of this paragraph, the original principal amount is the amount owed by the borrower when the borrower enters repayment.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Income-based repayment plan.</E> (1) Under this repayment plan, the required monthly payment for a borrower who has a partial financial hardship is limited to no more than 15 percent or, for a new borrower as of July 1, 2014, as defined in § 685.221(a)(4), 10 percent of the amount by which the borrower's AGI exceeds 150 percent of the poverty guideline applicable to the borrower's family size, divided by 12. The Secretary determines annually whether the borrower continues to qualify for this reduced monthly payment based on the amount of the borrower's eligible loans, AGI, and poverty guideline.</P>

              <P>(B) For a married borrower who files a joint Federal tax return with his or her spouse, the annual amount due on all of the borrower's eligible loans and, if applicable, the spouse's eligible loans, as calculated under a standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period, using the greater of the amount due at the time the loans initially entered repayment or at the time the borrower or spouse elects the Pay As You Earn repayment plan, exceeds 10 percent of the difference between the borrower's and spouse's AGI, and 150 percent of the poverty guideline for the borrower's family size; and</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Poverty guideline</E> refers to the income categorized by State and family size in the poverty guidelines published annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902(2). If a borrower is not a resident of a State identified in the poverty guidelines, the poverty guideline to be used for the borrower is the poverty guideline (for the relevant family size) used for the 48 contiguous States.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Terms of the Pay As You Earn repayment plan.</E> (i) A borrower may select the Pay As You Earn repayment plan only if the borrower has a partial financial hardship. The borrower's aggregate monthly loan payments are limited to no more than 10 percent of the amount by which the borrower's AGI exceeds 150 percent of the poverty guideline applicable to the borrower's family size, divided by 12.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary adjusts the calculated monthly payment if—</P>
              <P>(A) Except for borrowers provided for in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the total amount of the borrower's eligible loans are not Direct Loans, in which case the Secretary determines the borrower's adjusted monthly payment by multiplying the calculated payment by the percentage of the total outstanding principal amount of the borrower's eligible loans that are Direct Loans;</P>
              <P>(B) Both the borrower and borrower's spouse have eligible loans and filed a joint Federal tax return, in which case the Secretary determines—</P>

              <P>(iii) If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay the accrued interest on the borrower's Direct Subsidized loan or the subsidized portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan, the Secretary does not charge the borrower the remaining accrued interest for a period not to exceed three consecutive years from the established repayment period start date on that loan under the Pay As You Earn repayment plan. Any period during which the Secretary has previously not charged the borrower accrued interest on an eligible loan under the income-based repayment plan or the Revised Pay As You Earn repayment plan counts toward the maximum three years of subsidy a borrower is eligible to receive under the Pay As You Earn repayment plan. On a Direct Consolidation Loan that repays loans on which the Secretary has not charged the borrower accrued interest, the three-year period includes the period for which the Secretary did not charge the borrower accrued interest on the underlying loans. This three-year period does not include any period during which the borrower receives an economic hardship deferment.</P>
              <P>(iv)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, accrued interest is capitalized—</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) After the amount of accrued interest reaches the limit described in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, interest continues to accrue, but is not capitalized while the borrower remains on the Pay As You Earn repayment plan.</P>
              <P>(v) If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay any of the principal due, the payment of that principal is postponed until the borrower chooses to leave the Pay As You Earn repayment plan or no longer has a partial financial hardship.</P>
              <P>(vi) The repayment period for a borrower under the Pay As You Earn repayment plan may be greater than 10 years.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Payment application and prepayment.</E> (i) The Secretary applies any payment made under the Pay As You Earn repayment plan in the following order:</P>

              <P>(iv) If the prepayment amount exceeds a monthly payment amount of $0.00 under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the Secretary applies the prepayment consistent with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Changes in the payment amount.</E> (i) If a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship, the borrower may continue to make payments under the Pay As You Earn repayment plan, but the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment. The Secretary also recalculates the monthly payment for a borrower who chooses to stop making income-contingent payments. In either case, as a result of the recalculation—<PRTPAGE P="263"/>
              </P>
              <P>(A) The maximum monthly amount that the Secretary requires the borrower to repay is the amount the borrower would have paid under the standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period using the amount of the borrower's eligible loans that was outstanding at the time the borrower began repayment on the loans under the Pay As You Earn repayment plan; and</P>

              <P>(ii) A borrower who no longer wishes to repay under the Pay As You Earn repayment plan may change to a different repayment plan in accordance with § 685.210(b).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Eligibility documentation, verification, and notifications.</E> (i)(A) The Secretary determines whether a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the Pay As You Earn repayment plan for the year the borrower selects the plan and for each subsequent year that the borrower remains on the plan. To make this determination, the Secretary requires the borrower to provide documentation, acceptable to the Secretary, of the borrower's AGI.</P>
              <P>(B) If the borrower's AGI is not available, or if the Secretary believes that the borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current income, the borrower must provide other documentation to verify income.</P>
              <P>(C) The borrower must annually certify the borrower's family size. If the borrower fails to certify family size, the Secretary assumes a family size of one for that year.</P>
              <P>(ii) After making a determination that a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the Pay As You Earn repayment plan for the year the borrower initially elects the plan and for each subsequent year that the borrower has a partial financial hardship, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with—</P>

              <P>(C) An explanation of the consequences, as described in paragraphs (a)(5)(i)(C) and (a)(5)(vii) of this section, if the borrower does not provide the required information; and</P>
              <P>(D) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time during the borrower's current annual payment period, that the Secretary recalculate the borrower's monthly payment amount if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount that was used to calculate the borrower's current monthly payment no longer reflects the borrower's current income. If the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment amount based on the borrower's request, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii)(A) through (a)(5)(ii)(D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) For each subsequent year that a borrower who currently has a partial financial hardship remains on the Pay As You Earn repayment plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of the requirements in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section no later than 60 days and no earlier than 90 days prior to the date specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(A) of this section. The notification provides the borrower with—</P>
              <P>(A) The date, no earlier than 35 days before the end of the borrower's annual payment period, by which the Secretary must receive all of the documentation described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section (annual deadline); and</P>

              <P>(B) The consequences if the Secretary does not receive the information within 10 days following the annual deadline specified in the notice, including the borrower's new monthly payment <PRTPAGE P="264"/>amount as determined under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the effective date for the recalculated monthly payment amount, and the fact that unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized at the end of the borrower's current annual payment period in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) Each time the Secretary makes a determination that a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship for a subsequent year that the borrower wishes to remain on the plan, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with—</P>
              <P>(A) The borrower's recalculated monthly payment amount, as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section;</P>
              <P>(B) An explanation that unpaid interest will be capitalized in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(C) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time, that the Secretary redetermine whether the borrower has a partial financial hardship, if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount used to determine that the borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship does not reflect the borrower's current income, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified annually of this option. If the Secretary determines that the borrower again has a partial financial hardship, the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii)(A) through (a)(5)(ii)(D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) For each subsequent year that a borrower who does not currently have a partial financial hardship remains on the Pay As You Earn repayment plan, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraph (a)(5)(iv)(C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) If a borrower who is currently repaying under another repayment plan selects the Pay As You Earn repayment plan but does not provide the documentation described in paragraphs (a)(5)(i)(A) or (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section, or if the Secretary determines that the borrower does not have a partial financial hardship, the borrower remains on his or her current repayment plan.</P>
              <P>(vii) The Secretary designates the repayment option described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section if a borrower who is currently repaying under the Pay As You Earn repayment plan remains on the plan for a subsequent year but the Secretary does not receive the documentation described in paragraphs (a)(5)(i)(A) and (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline, unless the Secretary is able to determine the borrower's new monthly payment amount before the end of the borrower's current annual payment period.</P>
              <P>(viii) If the Secretary receives the documentation described in paragraphs (a)(5)(i)(A) and (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline—</P>
              <P>(A) The Secretary promptly determines the borrower's new scheduled monthly payment amount and maintains the borrower's current scheduled monthly payment amount until the new scheduled monthly payment amount is determined.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If the new monthly payment amount is less than the borrower's previously calculated Pay As You Earn repayment plan monthly payment amount, and the borrower made payments at the previously calculated amount after the end of the most recent annual payment period, the Secretary makes the appropriate adjustment to the borrower's account. Notwithstanding the requirements of § 685.211(a)(3), unless the borrower requests otherwise, the Secretary applies the excess payment amounts made after the end of the most recent annual payment period in accordance with the requirements of § 685.209(a)(3)(i).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the new monthly payment amount is equal to or greater than the borrower's previously calculated Pay As You Earn repayment plan monthly payment amount, and the borrower made payments at the previously calculated payment amount after the end <PRTPAGE P="265"/>of the most recent annual payment period, the Secretary does not make any adjustment to the borrower's account.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Any payments that the borrower continued to make at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the prior annual payment period and before the new monthly payment amount is calculated are considered to be qualifying payments for purposes of § 685.219, provided that the payments otherwise meet the requirements described in § 685.219(c)(1).</P>
              <P>(B) The new annual payment period begins on the day after the end of the most recent annual payment period.</P>
              <P>(ix)(A) If the Secretary receives the documentation described in paragraphs (a)(5)(i)(A) and (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section more than 10 days after the specified annual deadline and the borrower's monthly payment amount is recalculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the Secretary grants forbearance with respect to payments that are overdue or would be due at the time the new calculated Pay As You Earn repayment plan monthly payment amount is determined, if the new monthly payment amount is $0.00 or is less than the borrower's previously calculated income-based monthly payment amount. Interest that accrues during the portion of this forbearance period that covers payments that are overdue after the end of the prior annual payment period is not capitalized.</P>
              <P>(B) Any payments that the borrower continued to make at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the prior annual payment period and before the new monthly payment amount is calculated are considered to be qualifying payments for purposes of § 685.219, provided that the payments otherwise meet the requirements described in § 685.219(c)(1).</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Loan forgiveness.</E> (i) To qualify for loan forgiveness after 20 years, a borrower must have participated in the Pay As You Earn repayment plan and satisfied at least one of the following conditions during that period:</P>
              <P>(A) Made reduced monthly payments under a partial financial hardship as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section, including a monthly payment amount of $0.00, as provided under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) Made reduced monthly payments after the borrower no longer had a partial financial hardship or stopped making income-contingent payments as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(C) Made monthly payments under any repayment plan, that were not less than the amount required under the Direct Loan standard repayment plan described in § 685.208(b) with a 10-year repayment period.</P>
              <P>(D) Made monthly payments under the Direct Loan standard repayment plan described in § 685.208(b) for the amount of the borrower's loans that were outstanding at the time the borrower first selected the Pay As You Earn repayment plan.</P>

              <P>(A) The borrower made monthly payments under one or more of the repayment plans described in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section, including a monthly payment amount of $0.00, as provided under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section; and</P>

              </P>
              <P>(iii) For a borrower who qualifies for the Pay As You Earn repayment plan, the beginning date for the 20-year period is—</P>
              <P>(A) If the borrower made payments under the income-contingent repayment plan described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Revised Pay As You Earn repayment plan described in paragraph (c) of this section, or the income-based repayment plan described in § 685.221, the earliest date the borrower made a payment on the loan under one of those plans at any time after October 1, 2007; or</P>
              <P>(B) If the borrower did not make payments under the income-contingent repayment plan described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Revised Pay As You Earn repayment plan described in paragraph (c) of this section, or the income-based repayment plan described in § 685.221—</P>

The beginning date is the date the borrower made the payment or received the deferment after October 1, 2007;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For a borrower who has one or more other eligible Direct Loans, the date the borrower made a payment or received an economic hardship deferment on that loan. The beginning date is the date the borrower made that payment or received the deferment on that loan after October 1, 2007;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) For a borrower who did not make a payment or receive an economic hardship deferment on the loan under paragraph (a)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) or (a)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, the date the borrower made a payment on the loan under the Pay As You Earn repayment plan;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) If the borrower consolidates his or her eligible loans, the date the borrower made a payment on the Direct Consolidation Loan that met the requirements of paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section; or</P>

              <P>(iv) Any payments made on a defaulted loan are not made under a qualifying repayment plan and are not counted toward the 20-year forgiveness period.</P>
              <P>(v)(A) When the Secretary determines that a borrower has satisfied the loan forgiveness requirements under paragraph (a)(6) of this section on an eligible loan, the Secretary cancels the outstanding balance and accrued interest on that loan. No later than six months prior to the anticipated date that the borrower will meet the forgiveness requirements, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notice that includes—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) An explanation that the borrower is approaching the date that he or she is expected to meet the requirements to receive loan forgiveness;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A reminder that the borrower must continue to make the borrower's scheduled monthly payments; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) General information on the current treatment of the forgiveness amount for tax purposes, and instructions for the borrower to contact the Internal Revenue Service for more information.</P>
              <P>(B) The Secretary determines when a borrower has met the loan forgiveness requirements in paragraph (a)(6) of this section and does not require the borrower to submit a request for loan forgiveness.</P>
              <P>(C) After determining that a borrower has satisfied the loan forgiveness requirements, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Notifies the borrower that the borrower's obligation on the loans is satisfied;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Provides the borrower with the information described in paragraph (a)(6)(v)(A)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Returns to the sender any payment received on a loan after loan forgiveness has been granted.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Income-contingent repayment plan:</E> The income-contingent repayment (ICR) plan is an income-contingent repayment plan under which a borrower's monthly payment amount is generally <PRTPAGE P="267"/>based on the total amount of the borrower's Direct Loans, family size, and AGI.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Repayment amount calculation.</E> (i) The amount the borrower would repay is based upon the borrower's Direct Loan debt when the borrower's first loan enters repayment, and this basis for calculation does not change unless the borrower obtains another Direct Loan or the borrower and the borrower's spouse obtain approval to repay their loans jointly under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. If the borrower obtains another Direct Loan, the amount the borrower would repay is based on the combined amounts of the loans when the last loan enters repayment. If the borrower and the borrower's spouse repay the loans jointly, the amount the borrowers would repay is based on both borrowers' Direct Loan debts at the time they enter joint repayment.</P>
              <P>(ii) The annual amount payable by a borrower under the ICR plan is the lesser of—</P>

              <P>(A) The amount the borrower would repay annually over 12 years using standard amortization multiplied by an income percentage factor that corresponds to the borrower's AGI as shown in the income percentage factor table in a notice published annually by the Secretary in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>; or</P>
              <P>(B) 20 percent of discretionary income.</P>
              <P>(iii)(A) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, discretionary income is defined as a borrower's AGI minus the amount of the poverty guideline, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, for the borrower's family size as defined in § 685.209(a)(1)(iv).</P>
              <P>(B) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term “poverty guideline” refers to the income categorized by State and family size in the poverty guidelines published annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902(2). If a borrower is not a resident of a State identified in the poverty guidelines, the poverty line to be used for the borrower is the poverty guideline (for the relevant family size) used for the 48 contiguous States.</P>
              <P>(iv) For exact incomes not shown in the income percentage factor table in the annual notice published by the Secretary, an income percentage factor is calculated, based upon the intervals between the incomes and income percentage factors shown on the table.</P>
              <P>(v) Each year, the Secretary recalculates the borrower's annual payment amount based on changes in the borrower's AGI, the variable interest rate, the income percentage factors in the table in the annual notice published by the Secretary, and updated HHS Poverty Guidelines (if applicable).</P>
              <P>(vi) If a borrower's monthly payment is calculated to be greater than $0 but less than or equal to $5.00, the amount payable by the borrower is $5.00.</P>
              <P>(vii) For purposes of the annual recalculation described in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, after periods in which a borrower makes payments that are less than interest accrued on the loan, the payment amount is recalculated based upon unpaid accrued interest and the highest outstanding principal loan amount (including amount capitalized) calculated for that borrower while paying under the ICR plan.</P>

              <P>(viii) For each calendar year, the Secretary publishes in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a revised income percentage factor table reflecting changes based on inflation. This revised table is developed by changing each of the dollar amounts contained in the table by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage changes in the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) between December 1995 and the December next preceding the beginning of such calendar year.</P>
              <P>(ix) Examples of the calculation of monthly repayment amounts and tables that show monthly repayment amounts for borrowers at various income and debt levels are included in the annual notice published by the Secretary.</P>

              <P>(x) At the beginning of the repayment period under the ICR plan, the borrower must make monthly payments of the amount of interest that accrues on the borrower's Direct Loan until the Secretary calculates the borrower's monthly payment amount on the basis of the borrower's income.<PRTPAGE P="268"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Treatment of married borrowers.</E> (i)(A) For a married borrower who files a joint Federal tax return with his or her spouse, the AGI for both spouses is used to calculate the monthly payment amount under the ICR plan.</P>
              <P>(B) For a married borrower who files a Federal income tax return separately from his or her spouse, only the borrower's AGI is used to determine the monthly payment amount under the ICR plan.</P>
              <P>(ii) Married borrowers may repay their loans jointly. The outstanding balances on the loans of each borrower are added together to determine the borrowers' payback rate under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) The amount of the payment applied to each borrower's debt is the proportion of the payments that equals the same proportion as that borrower's debt to the total outstanding balance, except that the payment is credited toward outstanding interest on any loan before any payment is credited toward principal.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other features of the ICR plan</E>—(i) <E T="03">Alternative documentation of income.</E> If a borrower's AGI is not available or if, in the Secretary's opinion, the borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current income, the Secretary may use other documentation of income provided by the borrower to calculate the borrower's monthly repayment amount.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Adjustments to repayment obligations.</E> The Secretary may determine that special circumstances, such as a loss of employment by the borrower or the borrower's spouse, warrant an adjustment to the borrower's repayment obligations.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Repayment period.</E> (A) The maximum repayment period under the ICR plan is 25 years.</P>
              <P>(B) The repayment period includes—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Periods in which the borrower makes payments under the ICR plan on loans that are not in default;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Periods in which the borrower makes reduced monthly payments under the income-based repayment plan or a recalculated reduced monthly payment after the borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship or stops making income-based payments, as provided in § 685.221(d)(1)(i);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Periods in which the borrower made monthly payments under the Pay As You Earn repayment plan or the Revised Pay As You Earn repayment plan;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Periods in which the borrower made monthly payments under the alternative repayment plan described in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section prior to changing to a repayment plan described under this section or § 685.221;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Periods in which the borrower made monthly payments under the standard repayment plan after leaving the income-based repayment plan as provided in § 685.221(d)(2);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Periods in which the borrower makes payments under the standard repayment plan described in § 685.208(b);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) For borrowers who entered repayment before October 1, 2007, and if the repayment period is not more than 12 years, periods in which the borrower makes monthly payments under the extended repayment plans described in § 685.208(d) and (e), or the standard repayment plan described in § 685.208(c);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Periods after October 1, 2007, in which the borrower makes monthly payments under any other repayment plan that are not less than the amount required under the standard repayment plan described in § 685.208(b); or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">9</E>) Periods of economic hardship deferment.</P>
              <P>(C) If a borrower repays more than one loan under the ICR plan, a separate repayment period for each loan begins when that loan enters repayment.</P>
              <P>(D) If a borrower has not repaid a loan in full at the end of the 25-year repayment period under the ICR plan, the Secretary cancels the outstanding balance and accrued interest on that loan. No later than six months prior to the anticipated date that the borrower will meet the forgiveness requirements, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that includes—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) An explanation that the borrower is approaching the date that he or she is expected to meet the requirements to receive loan forgiveness;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A reminder that the borrower must continue to make the borrower's scheduled monthly payments; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) General information on the current treatment of the forgiveness <PRTPAGE P="269"/>amount for tax purposes, and instructions for the borrower to contact the Internal Revenue Service for more information.</P>
              <P>(E) The Secretary determines when a borrower has met the loan forgiveness requirements under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D) of this section and does not require the borrower to submit a request for loan forgiveness. After determining that a borrower has satisfied the loan forgiveness requirements, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Notifies the borrower that the borrower's obligation on the loans is satisfied;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Provides the information described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Returns to the sender any payment received on a loan after loan forgiveness has been granted.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Limitation on capitalization of interest.</E> If the amount of a borrower's monthly payment is less than the accrued interest, the unpaid interest is capitalized until the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than the original principal amount. After the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than the original amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized. For purposes of this paragraph, the original amount is the amount owed by the borrower when the borrower enters repayment.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Notification of terms and conditions.</E> When a borrower elects or is required by the Secretary to repay a loan under the ICR plan, and for each subsequent year that the borrower remains on the plan, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that provides the terms and conditions of the plan, including—</P>
              <P>(A) The borrower's scheduled monthly payment amount as calculated under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3)(vi)(D) of this section, as applicable, and the time period during which this scheduled monthly payment will apply (annual payment period);</P>
              <P>(B) Information about the requirement for the borrower to annually provide the information described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A) of this section, if the borrower chooses to remain on the ICR plan after the initial year on the plan, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified in advance of the date by which the Secretary must receive the information;</P>
              <P>(C) That if the borrower believes that special circumstances warrant an adjustment to the borrower's repayment obligations, as described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the borrower may contact the Secretary at any time during the borrower's current annual payment period and obtain the Secretary's determination as to whether an adjustment is appropriate; and</P>
              <P>(D) An explanation of the consequences, as described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(D) of this section, if the borrower does not provide the required information.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Documentation of income and certification of family size.</E> (A) For the initial year that a borrower selects the ICR plan and for each subsequent year that the borrower remains on the plan, the borrower must—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Provide to the Secretary, for purposes of calculating a monthly repayment amount and servicing and collecting the borrower's loan, acceptable documentation, as determined by the Secretary, of the borrower's AGI or alternative documentation of income in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Certify the borrower's family size. If the borrower fails to certify family size, the Secretary assumes a family size of one for the year.</P>

              <P>(B) For each subsequent year that a borrower remains on the ICR plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of the requirements described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A) of this section no later than 60 days and no earlier than 90 days prior to the date specified in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section. The notification provides the borrower with—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The date, no earlier than 35 days before the end of the borrower's annual payment period, by which the Secretary must receive the documentation described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A) of this section (annual deadline); and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The consequences if the Secretary does not receive the information within 10 days following the annual deadline specified in the notice, including the borrower's new monthly payment amount as determined under paragraph <PRTPAGE P="270"/>(b)(3)(vi)(D) of this section, and the effective date for the recalculated monthly payment amount.</P>

              <P>(C) The Secretary designates the standard repayment plan for a borrower who initially selects the ICR plan but does not comply with the requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section.</P>

              <P>(D) If, during a subsequent year that a borrower remains on the ICR plan, the Secretary does not receive the documentation described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline, the Secretary recalculates the borrower's required monthly payment amount, unless the Secretary is able to determine the borrower's new monthly payment amount before the end of the borrower's current annual payment period. The maximum recalculated monthly amount the Secretary requires the borrower to repay is the amount the borrower would have paid under the standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period using the amount of the borrower's loans that was outstanding at the time the borrower began repayment under the ICR plan. The repayment period based on the recalculated payment may exceed 10 years.</P>

              <P>(E) If the Secretary receives the documentation described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The Secretary promptly determines the borrower's new scheduled monthly payment amount and maintains the borrower's current scheduled monthly payment amount until the new scheduled monthly payment amount is determined.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) If the new calculated monthly payment amount is less than the borrower's previously calculated monthly payment amount, and the borrower made payments at the previously calculated amount after the end of the most recent annual payment period, the Secretary makes the appropriate adjustment to the borrower's account. Notwithstanding § 685.211(a)(3), the Secretary applies the excess payment amounts made after the end of the most recent annual payment period in accordance with the requirements of § 685.211(a)(1), unless the borrower requests otherwise.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) If the new monthly payment amount is equal to or greater than the borrower's previously calculated monthly payment amount, and the borrower made payments at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the most recent annual payment period, the Secretary does not make any adjustment to the borrower's account.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Any payments the borrower continued to make at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the prior annual payment period and before the new monthly payment amount is calculated are considered to be qualifying payments for purposes of § 685.219, provided that the payments otherwise meet the requirements described in § 685.219(c)(1).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The new annual payment period begins on the day after the end of the most recent annual payment period.</P>
              <P>(F)(<E T="03">1</E>) If the Secretary receives the documentation described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section more than 10 days after the specified annual deadline and the borrower's monthly payment amount is recalculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(D) of this section, the Secretary grants forbearance with respect to payments that are overdue or would be due at the time the new calculated monthly payment amount is determined, if the new monthly payment amount is $0.00 or is less than the borrower's previously calculated monthly payment amount. Interest that accrues during the portion of this forbearance period that covers payments that are overdue after the end of the prior annual payment period is not capitalized.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Any payments that the borrower continued to make at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the prior annual payment period and before the new monthly payment amount is calculated are considered to be qualifying payments for purposes of § 685.219, provided that the payments otherwise meet the requirements described in § 685.219(c)(1).</P>

              <P>(G) If a borrower defaults and the Secretary designates the ICR plan for the borrower but the borrower fails to <PRTPAGE P="271"/>comply with the requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A) of this section, the Secretary mails a notice to the borrower establishing a repayment schedule for the borrower.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Revised Pay As You Earn repayment plan.</E> The Revised Pay As You Earn repayment plan (REPAYE plan) is an income-contingent repayment plan under which a borrower's monthly payment amount is based on the borrower's AGI and family size.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this paragraph (c)—</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Adjusted gross income</E> (AGI) means the borrower's adjusted gross income as reported to the Internal Revenue Service. For a married borrower filing jointly, AGI includes both the borrower's and spouse's income and is used to calculate the monthly payment amount. For a married borrower filing separately, the AGI for each spouse is combined to calculate the monthly payment amount, unless the borrower certifies, on a form approved by the Secretary, that the borrower is—</P>
              <P>(A) Separated from his or her spouse; or</P>
              <P>(B) Unable to reasonably access the income information of his or her spouse.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Eligible loan</E>, for purposes of adjusting a borrower's monthly payment amount in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, means any outstanding loan made to a borrower under the Direct Loan Program or the FFEL Program except for a defaulted loan, a Direct PLUS Loan or Federal PLUS Loan made to a parent borrower, or a Direct Consolidation Loan or Federal Consolidation Loan that repaid a Direct PLUS Loan or Federal PLUS Loan made to a parent borrower;</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Family size</E> means the number that is determined by counting the borrower, the borrower's spouse, and the borrower's children, including unborn children who will be born during the year the borrower certifies family size, if the children receive more than half their support from the borrower. Family size does not include the borrower's spouse if the borrower is separated from his or her spouse, or if the borrower is filing separately and is unable to reasonably access the spouse's income information. A borrower's family size includes other individuals if, at the time the borrower certifies family size, the other individuals—</P>
              <P>(A) Live with the borrower; and</P>
              <P>(B) Receive more than half their support from the borrower and will continue to receive this support from the borrower for the year the borrower certifies family size. Support includes money, gifts, loans, housing, food, clothes, car, medical and dental care, and payment of college costs; and</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Poverty guideline</E> refers to the income categorized by State and family size in the poverty guidelines published annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902(2). If a borrower is not a resident of a State identified in the poverty guidelines, the poverty guideline to be used for the borrower is the poverty guideline (for the relevant family size) used for the 48 contiguous States.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Terms of the Revised Pay As You Earn repayment plan.</E> (i) The aggregate monthly loan payments of a borrower who selects the REPAYE plan are limited to no more than 10 percent of the amount by which the borrower's AGI exceeds 150 percent of the poverty guideline applicable to the borrower's family size, divided by 12, unless the borrower's monthly payment amount is adjusted in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(vi)(E) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary adjusts the calculated monthly payment if—</P>
              <P>(A) Except for borrowers provided for in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the borrower's eligible loans are not solely Direct Loans, in which case the Secretary determines the borrower's adjusted monthly payment by multiplying the calculated payment by the percentage of the total outstanding principal amount of the borrower's eligible loans that are Direct Loans;</P>
              <P>(B) Except in the case of a married borrower filing separately whose spouse's income is excluded in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, both the borrower and borrower's spouse have eligible loans, in which case the Secretary determines—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Each borrower's percentage of the couple's total eligible loan debt;<PRTPAGE P="272"/>
              </P>

              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) If the borrower's loans are held by multiple holders, the borrower's adjusted monthly Direct Loan payment by multiplying the payment determined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section by the percentage of the total outstanding principal amount of the borrower's eligible loans that are Direct Loans;</P>
              <P>(C) The calculated amount under paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section is less than $5.00, in which case the borrower's monthly payment is $0.00; or</P>
              <P>(D) The calculated amount under paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section is equal to or greater than $5.00 but less than $10.00, in which case the borrower's monthly payment is $10.00.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay the accrued interest on the borrower's loan—</P>
              <P>(A) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, for a Direct Subsidized Loan or the subsidized portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan, the Secretary does not charge the borrower the remaining accrued interest for a period not to exceed three consecutive years from the established repayment period start date on that loan under the REPAYE plan. Following this three-year period, the Secretary charges the borrower 50 percent of the remaining accrued interest on the Direct Subsidized Loan or the subsidized portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan.</P>
              <P>(B) For a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan made to a graduate or professional student, the unsubsidized portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan, or for a Direct Subsidized Loan or the subsidized portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan for which the borrower has become responsible for accruing interest in accordance with § 685.200(f)(3), the Secretary charges the borrower 50 percent of the remaining accrued interest.</P>
              <P>(C) The three-year period described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Does not include any period during which the borrower receives an economic hardship deferment;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Includes any prior period of repayment under the income-based repayment plan or the Pay As You Earn repayment plan; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) For a Direct Consolidation Loan, includes any period in which the underlying loans were repaid under the income-based repayment plan or the Pay As You Earn repayment plan.</P>
              <P>(iv) Any unpaid accrued interest is capitalized at the time a borrower leaves the REPAYE plan.</P>
              <P>(v) If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay any of the principal due, the payment of that principal is postponed until the borrower leaves the REPAYE plan.</P>
              <P>(vi) A borrower who no longer wishes to repay under the REPAYE plan may change to a different repayment plan in accordance with § 685.210(b). A borrower who changes to a different repayment plan in accordance with this paragraph or paragraph (c)(4)(vi)(C) of this section may return to the REPAYE plan pursuant to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(4)(vi)(D) and (E) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Payment application and prepayment.</E> (i) The Secretary applies any payment made under the REPAYE plan in the following order:</P>

              <P>(ii) The borrower may prepay all or part of a loan at any time without penalty, as provided under § 685.211(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(iii) If the prepayment amount equals or exceeds a monthly payment amount of $10.00 or more under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the Secretary applies the prepayment consistent with the requirements of § 685.211(a)(3).</P>
              <P>(iv) If the prepayment amount exceeds a monthly payment amount of $0.00 under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the Secretary applies the prepayment consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Eligibility documentation, verification, and notifications.</E> (i)(A) For the year the borrower initially selects <PRTPAGE P="273"/>the REPAYE plan and for each subsequent year that the borrower remains on the plan, the Secretary determines the borrower's monthly payment amount for that year. To make this determination, the Secretary requires the borrower to provide documentation, acceptable to the Secretary, of the borrower's AGI.</P>
              <P>(B) If the borrower's AGI is not available, or if the Secretary believes that the borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current income, the borrower must provide other documentation to verify income.</P>
              <P>(C) Unless otherwise directed by the Secretary, the borrower must annually certify the borrower's family size. If the borrower fails to certify family size, the Secretary assumes a family size of one for that year.</P>
              <P>(ii) After making the determination described in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section for the initial year that the borrower selects the REPAYE plan and for each subsequent year that the borrower remains on the plan, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with—</P>
              <P>(A) The borrower's scheduled monthly payment amount, as calculated under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and the time period during which this scheduled monthly payment amount will apply (annual payment period);</P>
              <P>(B) Information about the requirement for the borrower to annually provide the information described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, if the borrower chooses to remain on the REPAYE plan after the initial year on the plan, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified in advance of the date by which the Secretary must receive this information;</P>
              <P>(C) An explanation of the consequences, as described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(C) and (c)(4)(v) and (vi) of this section, if the borrower does not provide the required information; and</P>
              <P>(D) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time during the borrower's current annual payment period, that the Secretary recalculate the borrower's monthly payment amount if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount that was used to calculate the borrower's current monthly payment no longer reflects the borrower's current income. If the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment amount based on the borrower's request, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) For each subsequent year that a borrower remains on the REPAYE plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of the requirements in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section no later than 60 days and no earlier than 90 days prior to the date specified in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. The notification provides the borrower with—</P>
              <P>(A) The date, no earlier than 35 days before the end of the borrower's annual payment period, by which the Secretary must receive all of the documentation described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section (annual deadline); and</P>

              <P>(iv) If a borrower who is currently repaying under another repayment plan selects the REPAYE plan but does not provide the documentation described in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, the borrower remains on his or her current repayment plan.</P>

              <P>(v) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, if a borrower who is currently repaying under the REPAYE plan remains on the plan for a subsequent year but the Secretary does not receive the documentation described in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline, the Secretary removes the borrower from the REPAYE plan and places the borrower on an alternative repayment plan under which the borrower's required monthly payment is the amount necessary to repay the borrower's loan in full within the earlier of—<PRTPAGE P="274"/>
              </P>
              <P>(A) Ten years from the date the borrower begins repayment under the alternative repayment plan; or</P>
              <P>(B) The ending date of the 20- or 25-year period as described in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) If the Secretary places the borrower on an alternative repayment plan in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification containing the borrower's new monthly payment amount and informing the borrower that—</P>
              <P>(A) The borrower has been placed on an alternative repayment plan;</P>
              <P>(B) The borrower's monthly payment amount has been recalculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section;</P>

              <P>(D) The borrower may return to the REPAYE plan if he or she provides the documentation, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, necessary for the Secretary to calculate the borrower's current REPAYE plan monthly payment amount and the monthly amount the borrower would have been required to pay under the REPAYE plan during the period when the borrower was on the alternative repayment plan or any other repayment plan;</P>
              <P>(E) If the Secretary determines that the total amount of the payments the borrower was required to make while on the alternative repayment plan or any other repayment plan is less than the total amount the borrower would have been required to make under the REPAYE plan during that period, the Secretary will adjust the borrower's monthly REPAYE plan payment amount to ensure that the difference between the two amounts is paid in full by the end of the 20- or 25-year period described in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section;</P>
              <P>(F) If the borrower returns to the REPAYE plan or changes to the Pay As You Earn repayment plan described in paragraph (a) of this section, the income-contingent repayment plan described in paragraph (b) of this section, or the income-based repayment plan described in § 685.221, any payments that the borrower made under the alternative repayment plan after the borrower was removed from the REPAYE plan will count toward forgiveness under the REPAYE plan or the other repayment plans under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section or § 685.221; and</P>
              <P>(G) Payments made under the alternative repayment plan described in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section will not count toward public service loan forgiveness under § 685.219.</P>
              <P>(vii) The Secretary does not take the action described in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section if the Secretary receives the documentation described in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section more than 10 days after the specified annual deadline, but is able to determine the borrower's new monthly payment amount before the end of the borrower's current annual payment period.</P>
              <P>(viii) If the Secretary receives the documentation described in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline—</P>
              <P>(A) The Secretary promptly determines the borrower's new scheduled monthly payment amount and maintains the borrower's current scheduled monthly payment amount until the new scheduled monthly payment amount is determined.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If the new monthly payment amount is less than the borrower's previously calculated REPAYE plan monthly payment amount, and the borrower made payments at the previously calculated amount after the end of the most recent annual payment period, the Secretary makes the appropriate adjustment to the borrower's account. Notwithstanding the requirements of § 685.211(a)(3), unless the borrower requests otherwise, the Secretary applies the excess payment amounts made after the end of the most recent annual payment period in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Any payments that the borrower continued to make at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the prior annual payment period and before the new monthly payment amount is calculated are considered to be qualifying payments for purposes of § 685.219, provided that the payments otherwise meet the requirements described in § 685.219(c)(1).</P>
              <P>(B) The new annual payment period begins on the day after the end of the most recent annual payment period.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Loan forgiveness.</E> (i) A borrower who meets the requirements specified in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section may qualify for loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(B) A borrower whose loans being repaid under the REPAYE plan include a loan the borrower received as a graduate or professional student or a consolidation loan that repaid a loan received as a graduate or professional student may qualify for forgiveness after 25 years.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Secretary cancels any remaining outstanding balance of principal and accrued interest on a borrower's Direct Loans that are being repaid under the REPAYE plan after—</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial selection of a repayment plan.</E> (1) Before a Direct Loan enters into repayment, the Secretary provides the borrower a description of the available repayment plans and requests the borrower to select one. A borrower may select a repayment plan before the loan enters repayment by notifying the Secretary of the borrower's selection in writing.</P>
              <P>(2) If a borrower does not select a repayment plan, the Secretary designates the standard repayment plan described in § 685.208(b) or (c) for the borrower, as applicable.</P>

However, a borrower who is repaying a defaulted loan under an income-contingent repayment plan or the income-based repayment plan in accordance with § 685.211(d)(3)(ii), or who is repaying a Direct Consolidation Loan under the income-contingent repayment plan or the income-based repayment plan in accordance with § 685.220(d)(1)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">3</E>) may not change to another repayment plan unless—</P>

              <P>(ii) The borrower was not required to make payments but made three reasonable and affordable payments in each of the prior three months; and<PRTPAGE P="277"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) The borrower makes and the Secretary approves a request to change plans.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) A borrower may not change to a repayment plan that has a maximum repayment period of less than the number of years the loan has already been in repayment, except that a borrower may change to either the income-contingent or income-based repayment plan at any time.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a borrower changes repayment plans, the repayment period is the period provided under the borrower's new repayment plan, calculated from the date the loan initially entered repayment. However, if a borrower changes to the income-contingent repayment plan under § 685.209(a), the income-contingent repayment plan under § 685.209(b), the income-contingent repayment plan under § 685.209(c), or the income-based repayment plan under § 685.221, the repayment period is calculated as described in § 685.209(a)(6)(iii), § 685.209(b)(3)(iii), § 685.209(c)(5)(v), or § 685.221(f)(3), respectively.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Miscellaneous repayment provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Payment application and prepayment.</E> (1) Except as provided for the income-contingent repayment plan under § 685.209(a)(3) or the income-based repayment plan under § 685.221(c)(1), the Secretary applies any payment first to any accrued charges and collection costs, then to any outstanding interest, and then to outstanding principal.</P>
              <P>(2) A borrower may prepay all or part of a loan at any time without penalty. If a borrower pays any amount in excess of the amount due, the excess amount is a prepayment.</P>
              <P>(3) If a prepayment equals or exceeds the monthly repayment amount under the borrower's repayment plan, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(i) Applies the prepaid amount according to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) Advances the due date of the next payment unless the borrower requests otherwise; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Notifies the borrower of any revised due date for the next payment.</P>
              <P>(4) If a prepayment is less than the monthly repayment amount, the Secretary applies the prepayment according to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Repayment incentives.</E> To encourage on-time repayment, the Secretary may reduce the interest rate for a borrower who repays a loan under a system or on a schedule that meets requirements specified by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Refunds and returns of title IV, HEA program funds from schools.</E> The Secretary applies any refund or return of title IV, HEA program funds that the Secretary receives from a school under § 668.22 against the borrower's outstanding principal and notifies the borrower of the refund or return.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Default</E>—(1) <E T="03">Acceleration.</E> If a borrower defaults on a Direct Loan, the entire unpaid balance and accrued interest are immediately due and payable.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Collection charges.</E> If a borrower defaults on a Direct Loan, the Secretary assesses collection charges in accordance with § 685.202(e).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Collection of a defaulted loan.</E> (i) The Secretary may take any action authorized by law to collect a defaulted Direct Loan including, but not limited to, filing a lawsuit against the borrower, reporting the default to nationwide consumer reporting agencies, requesting the Internal Revenue Service to offset the borrower's Federal income tax refund, and garnishing the borrower's wages.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a borrower defaults on a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct Consolidation Loan, or a student Direct PLUS Loan, the Secretary may designate the income-contingent repayment plan or the income-based repayment plan for the borrower.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Ineligible borrowers.</E> (1) The Secretary determines that a borrower is ineligible if, at the time the loan was made and without the school's or the Secretary's knowledge, the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) provided false or erroneous information, has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or <PRTPAGE P="278"/>guilty to, a crime involving fraud in obtaining title IV, HEA program funds, or took actions that caused the borrower or student—</P>
              <P>(i) To receive a loan for which the borrower is wholly or partially ineligible;</P>
              <P>(ii) To receive interest benefits for which the borrower was ineligible; or</P>
              <P>(iii) To receive loan proceeds for a period of enrollment for which the borrower was not eligible.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary makes the determination described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Secretary sends an ineligible borrower a demand letter that requires the borrower to repay some or all of a loan, as appropriate. The demand letter requires that within 30 days from the date the letter is mailed, the borrower repay any principal amount for which the borrower is ineligible and any accrued interest, including interest subsidized by the Secretary, through the previous quarter.</P>
              <P>(3) If a borrower fails to comply with the demand letter described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the borrower is in default on the entire loan.</P>
              <P>(4) A borrower may not consolidate a loan under § 685.220 for which the borrower is wholly or partially ineligible.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Rehabilitation of defaulted loans.</E> (1) A defaulted Direct Loan, except for a loan on which a judgment has been obtained, is rehabilitated if the borrower makes 9 voluntary, reasonable and affordable monthly payments within 20 days of the due date during 10 consecutive months. The Secretary determines the amount of a borrower's reasonable and affordable payment on the basis of a borrower's total financial circumstances.</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary initially considers the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount to be an amount equal to 15 percent of the amount by which the borrower's AGI exceeds 150 percent of the poverty guideline amount applicable to the borrower's family size and State, divided by 12, except that if this amount is less than $5, the borrower's monthly rehabilitation payment is $5.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary may calculate the payment amount based on information provided orally by the borrower or the borrower's representative and provide the borrower with a rehabilitation agreement using that amount. The Secretary requires the borrower to provide documentation to confirm the borrower's AGI and family size. If the borrower does not provide the Secretary with any documentation requested by the Secretary to calculate or confirm the reasonable and affordable payment amount within a reasonable time deadline set by the Secretary, the rehabilitation agreement provided is null and void.</P>
              <P>(iii) A reasonable and affordable payment amount is not—</P>
              <P>(A) A required minimum loan payment amount (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> $50) if the Secretary determines that a smaller amount is reasonable and affordable;</P>
              <P>(B) A percentage of the borrower's total loan balance; or</P>
              <P>(C) Based on other criteria unrelated to the borrower's total financial circumstances.</P>

              <P>(iv) Within 15 business days of the Secretary's determination of the borrower's loan rehabilitation payment amount, the Secretary provides the borrower with a written rehabilitation agreement which includes the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount, a prominent statement that the borrower may object orally or in writing to the reasonable and affordable payment amount with the method and timeframe for raising such an objection, a statement that the rehabilitation is null and void if the borrower does not provide the documentation required to calculate the reasonable and affordable payment amount, and an explanation of any other terms and conditions applicable to the required series of payments that must be made. To accept the agreement, the borrower must sign and return the agreement or accept the agreement electronically under a process provided by the Secretary. The Secretary does not impose any other conditions unrelated to the amount or timing of the rehabilitation payments in the rehabilitation agreement. The written rehabilitation agreement informs the borrower of the effects of having the loans rehabilitated (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> removal of the record of default from the borrower's credit history and return to normal repayment).<PRTPAGE P="279"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary provides the borrower with a written statement confirming the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount, as determined by the Secretary, and explaining any other terms and conditions applicable to the required series of payments that must be made before the borrower's account can be rehabilitated. The statement informs the borrower that the borrower may object to the terms and conditions of the rehabilitation agreement, and explains the method and timeframe for objecting to the terms and conditions of the rehabilitation agreement.</P>
              <P>(3) If the borrower objects to the monthly payment amount determined under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Secretary recalculates the payment based solely on information provided on a form approved by the Secretary and, if requested, supporting documentation from the borrower and other sources, and considers—</P>
              <P>(i) The borrower's, and if applicable, the spouse's current disposable income, including public assistance payments, and other income received by the borrower and the spouse, such as welfare benefits, Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income, and workers' compensation. Spousal income is not considered if the spouse does not contribute to the borrower's household income;</P>
              <P>(ii) Family size as defined in § 685.221(a)(3); and</P>
              <P>(iii) Reasonable and necessary expenses, which include—</P>
              <P>(A) Food;</P>
              <P>(B) Housing;</P>
              <P>(C) Utilities;</P>
              <P>(D) Basic communication expenses;</P>
              <P>(E) Necessary medical and dental costs;</P>
              <P>(F) Necessary insurance costs;</P>
              <P>(G) Transportation costs;</P>
              <P>(H) Dependent care and other work-related expenses;</P>
              <P>(I) Legally required child and spousal support;</P>
              <P>(J) Other title IV and non-title IV student loan payments; and</P>
              <P>(K) Other expenses approved by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(4) The Secretary provides the borrower with a new written rehabilitation agreement confirming the borrower's recalculated reasonable and affordable payment amount. To accept the agreement, the borrower must sign and return the agreement or accept the agreement electronically under a process provided by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(5) The Secretary includes any payment made under paragraph (1) of the definition of “satisfactory repayment arrangement” in § 685.102(b) in determining whether the 9 out of 10 payments required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section have been made.</P>
              <P>(6) A borrower may request that the monthly payment amount be adjusted due to a change in the borrower's total financial circumstances only upon providing the documentation specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) During the rehabilitation period, the Secretary limits contact with the borrower on the loan being rehabilitated to collection activities that are required by law or regulation and to communications that support the rehabilitation.</P>
              <P>(8) If a defaulted loan is rehabilitated, the Secretary instructs any consumer reporting agency to which the default was reported to remove the default from the borrower's credit history.</P>
              <P>(9) A defaulted Direct Loan on which a judgment has been obtained may not be rehabilitated.</P>
              <P>(10) A Direct Loan obtained by fraud for which the borrower has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving fraud in obtaining title IV, HEA program assistance may not be rehabilitated.</P>
              <P>(11)(i) If a borrower's loan is being collected by administrative wage garnishment while the borrower is also making monthly payments on the same loan under a loan rehabilitation agreement, the Secretary continues collecting the loan by administrative wage garnishment until the borrower makes five qualifying monthly payments under the rehabilitation agreement, unless the Secretary is otherwise precluded from doing so.</P>

              <P>(ii) After the borrower makes the fifth qualifying monthly payment, the Secretary, unless otherwise directed by the borrower, suspends the garnishment order issued to the borrower's employer.<PRTPAGE P="280"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) A borrower may only obtain the benefit of a suspension of administrative wage garnishment while also attempting to rehabilitate a defaulted loan once.</P>
              <P>(12) Effective for any defaulted Direct Loan that is rehabilitated on or after August 14, 2008, the borrower cannot rehabilitate the loan again if the loan returns to default status following the rehabilitation.</P>

              <P>(i) The Secretary considers a borrower defense claim asserted on a Direct Consolidation Loan by determining—</P>
              <P>(A) Whether the act or omission of the school with regard to the loan described in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, other than a Direct Subsidized, Unsubsidized, or PLUS Loan, constitutes a borrower defense under § 685.206(c), for a Direct Consolidation Loan made before July 1, 2017, or under § 685.222, for a Direct Consolidation Loan made on or after July 1, 2017; or</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) A borrower's Direct Loan is discharged if the borrower becomes totally and permanently disabled, as defined in § 685.102(b), and satisfies the eligibility requirements in this section.</P>
              <P>(2) For a borrower who becomes totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 685.102(b), the borrower's loan discharge application is processed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) For veterans who are totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (2) of the definition of that term in § 685.102(b), the veteran's loan discharge application is processed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) For purposes of this section, a borrower's representative or a veteran's representative is a member of the borrower's family, the borrower's attorney, or another individual authorized to act on behalf of the borrower in connection with the borrower's total and permanent disability discharge application. References to a “borrower” or a “veteran” include, if applicable, the borrower's representative or the veteran's representative for purposes of applying for a total and permanent disability discharge, providing notifications or information to the Secretary, and receiving notifications from the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Discharge application process for a borrower who is totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 685.102(b)</E>—(1) <E T="03">Borrower application for discharge.</E> To qualify for a discharge of a Direct Loan based on a total and permanent disability, a borrower must submit a discharge application to the Secretary on a form approved by the Secretary. If the borrower notifies the Secretary that the borrower claims to be totally and permanent disabled prior to submitting a total and permanent disability discharge application, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(i) Provides the borrower with information needed for the borrower to apply for a total and permanent disability discharge;</P>
              <P>(ii) Suspends collection activity on any of the borrower's title IV loans held by the Secretary, and notifies the borrower's other title IV loan holders to suspend collection activity on the borrower's title IV loans for a period not to exceed 120 days; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Informs the borrower that the suspension of collection activity will end after 120 days and collection will resume on the loans if the borrower does not submit a total and permanent disability discharge application to the Secretary within that time.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Physician certification or Social Security Administration (SSA) disability notice of award.</E> The application must contain—<PRTPAGE P="283"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) A certification by a physician, who is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy legally authorized to practice in a State, that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 685.102(b); or</P>
              <P>(ii) An SSA notice of award for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits indicating that the borrower's next scheduled disability review will be within five to seven years.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Deadline for application submission.</E> The borrower must submit the application described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the Secretary within 90 days of the date the physician certifies the application, if applicable. Upon receipt of the borrower's application, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(i) Identifies all title IV loans owed by the borrower, notifies the lenders that the Secretary has received a total and permanent disability discharge application from the borrower and directs the lenders to suspend collection activity or maintain the suspension of collection activity on the borrower's title IV loans;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the application is incomplete, notifies the borrower of the missing information and requests the missing information from the borrower or the physician who certified the application, as appropriate, and does not make a determination of eligibility for discharge until the application is complete;</P>
              <P>(iii) Notifies the borrower that no payments are due on the loan while the Secretary determines the borrower's eligibility for discharge; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Explains the process for the Secretary's review of total and permanent disability discharge applications.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Determination of eligibility.</E> (i) If, after reviewing the borrower's completed application, the Secretary determines that the physician's certification or the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits supports the conclusion that the borrower meets the criteria for a total and permanent disability discharge, as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 685.102(b), the borrower is considered totally and permanently disabled—</P>
              <P>(A) As of the date the physician certified the borrower's application; or</P>
              <P>(B) As of the date the Secretary received the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary may require the borrower to submit additional medical evidence if the Secretary determines that the borrower's application does not conclusively prove that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 685.102(b). As part of the Secretary's review of the borrower's discharge application, the Secretary may require and arrange for an additional review of the borrower's condition by an independent physician at no expense to the borrower.</P>
              <P>(iii) After determining that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled, as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 685.102(b), the Secretary discharges the borrower's obligation to make any further payments on the loan, notifies the borrower that the loan has been discharged, and returns to the person who made the payments on the loan any payments received after the date the physician certified the borrower's loan discharge application or the date the Secretary received the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits. The notification to the borrower explains the terms and conditions under which the borrower's obligation to repay the loan will be reinstated, as specified in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the Secretary determines that the physician's certification or the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits provided by the borrower does not support the conclusion that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled, as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of that term in § 685.102(b), the Secretary notifies the borrower that the application for a disability discharge has been denied. The notification to the borrower includes—</P>
              <P>(A) The reason or reasons for the denial;</P>

              <P>(B) A statement that the loan is due and payable to the Secretary under the terms of the promissory note and that the loan will return to the status that <PRTPAGE P="284"/>would have existed if the total and permanent disability discharge application had not been received;</P>
              <P>(C) The date that the borrower must resume making payments;</P>
              <P>(D) An explanation that the borrower is not required to submit a new total and permanent disability discharge application if the borrower requests that the Secretary re-evaluate the borrower's application for discharge by providing, within 12 months of the date of the notification, additional information that supports the borrower's eligibility for discharge; and</P>
              <P>(E) An explanation that if the borrower does not request re-evaluation of the borrower's prior discharge application within 12 months of the date of the notification, the borrower must submit a new total and permanent disability discharge application to the Secretary if the borrower wishes the Secretary to re-evaluate the borrower's eligibility for a total and permanent disability discharge.</P>
              <P>(v) If the borrower requests re-evaluation in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(D) of this section or submits a new total and permanent disability discharge application in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(E) of this section, the request must include new information regarding the borrower's disabling condition that was not provided to the Secretary in connection with the prior application at the time the Secretary reviewed the borrower's initial application for total and permanent disability discharge.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Treatment of disbursements made during the period from the date of the physician's certification or the date the Secretary received the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits until the date of discharge.</E> If a borrower received a title IV loan or TEACH Grant before the date the physician certified the borrower's discharge application or before the date the Secretary received the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits and a disbursement of that loan or grant is made during the period from the date of the physician's certification or the receipt of the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits until the date the Secretary grants a discharge under this section, the processing of the borrower's loan discharge request will be suspended until the borrower ensures that the full amount of the disbursement has been returned to the loan holder or to the Secretary, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Receipt of new title IV loans or TEACH Grants after the date of the physician's certification or after the date the Secretary received the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits.</E> If a borrower receives a disbursement of a new title IV loan or receives a new TEACH Grant made on or after the date the physician certified the borrower's discharge application or on or after the date the Secretary received the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits and before the date the Secretary grants a discharge under this section, the Secretary denies the borrower's discharge request and resumes collection on the borrower's loan.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Conditions for reinstatement of a loan after a total and permanent disability discharge.</E> (i) The Secretary reinstates a borrower's obligation to repay a loan that was discharged in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section if, within three years after the date the Secretary granted the discharge, the borrower—</P>
              <P>(A) Has annual earnings from employment that exceed 100 percent of the poverty guideline for a family of two, as published annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902(2);</P>
              <P>(B) Receives a new TEACH Grant or a new loan under the Perkins or Direct Loan programs, except for a Direct Consolidation Loan that includes loans that were not discharged;</P>
              <P>(C) Fails to ensure that the full amount of any disbursement of a title IV loan or TEACH Grant received prior to the discharge date that is made is returned to the loan holder or to the Secretary, as applicable, within 120 days of the disbursement date; or</P>

              <P>(D) Receives a notice from the SSA indicating that the borrower is no longer disabled or that the borrower's continuing disability review will no longer be the five- to seven-year period indicated in the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits.<PRTPAGE P="285"/>
              </P>

              <P>(A) Notifies the borrower that the borrower's obligation to repay the loan has been reinstated;</P>
              <P>(B) Returns the loan to the status that would have existed if the total and permanent disability discharge application had not been received; and</P>
              <P>(C) Does not require the borrower to pay interest on the loan for the period from the date the loan was discharged until the date the borrower's obligation to repay the loan was reinstated.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Secretary's notification under paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(A) of this section will include—</P>
              <P>(A) The reason or reasons for the reinstatement;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Closed school discharge.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The Secretary discharges the borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan in accordance with the provisions of this section if the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) did not complete the program of study for which the loan was made because the school at which the borrower (or student) was enrolled closed, as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of this section—</P>
              <P>(i) A school's closure date is the date that the school ceases to provide educational instruction in all programs, as determined by the Secretary; and</P>
              <P>(ii) “School” means a school's main campus or any location or branch of the main campus, regardless of whether the school or its location or branch is considered eligible.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Relief pursuant to discharge.</E> (1) Discharge under this section relieves the borrower of any past or present obligation to repay the loan and any accrued charges or collection costs with respect to the loan.</P>
              <P>(2) The discharge of a loan under this section qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through enforced collection on the loan.</P>
              <P>(3) The Secretary does not regard a borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under this section as in default on the loan after discharge, and such a borrower is eligible to receive assistance under programs authorized by title IV of the Act.</P>
              <P>(4) The Secretary reports the discharge of a loan under this section to all consumer reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Borrower qualification for discharge.</E> (1) In order to qualify for discharge of a loan under this section, a borrower must submit to the Secretary a written request and sworn statement, and the factual assertions in the statement must be true. The statement need not be notarized but must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. In the statement, the borrower must—</P>
              <P>(i) State that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed)—</P>
              <P>(A) Received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986 to attend a school;</P>

              <P>(B) Did not complete the program of study at that school because the school closed while the student was enrolled, or the student withdrew from the <PRTPAGE P="287"/>school not more than 120 days before the school closed. The Secretary may extend the 120-day period if the Secretary determines that exceptional circumstances related to a school's closing justify an extension. Exceptional circumstances for this purpose may include, but are not limited to: the school's loss of accreditation; the school's discontinuation of the majority of its academic programs; action by the State to revoke the school's license to operate or award academic credentials in the State; or a finding by a State or Federal government agency that the school violated State or Federal law; and</P>
              <P>(C) Did not complete the program of study through a teach-out at another school or by transferring academic credits or hours earned at the closed school to another school;</P>
              <P>(ii) State whether the borrower (or student) has made a claim with respect to the school's closing with any third party, such as the holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, if so, the amount of any payment received by the borrower (or student) or credited to the borrower's loan obligation; and</P>
              <P>(iii) State that the borrower (or student)—</P>
              <P>(A) Agrees to provide to the Secretary upon request other documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this section; and</P>
              <P>(B) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and to transfer any right to recovery against a third party to the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary determines, based on information in the Secretary's possession, that the borrower qualifies for the discharge of a loan under this section, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(i) May discharge the loan without an application from the borrower; and</P>
              <P>(ii) With respect to schools that closed on or after November 1, 2013, will discharge the loan without an application from the borrower if the borrower did not subsequently re-enroll in any title IV-eligible institution within a period of three years from the date the school closed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Cooperation by borrower in enforcement actions.</E> (1) In order to obtain a discharge under this section, a borrower must cooperate with the Secretary in any judicial or administrative proceeding brought by the Secretary to recover amounts discharged or to take other enforcement action with respect to the conduct on which the discharge was based. At the request of the Secretary and upon the Secretary's tendering to the borrower the fees and costs that are customarily provided in litigation to reimburse witnesses, the borrower must—</P>
              <P>(i) Provide testimony regarding any representation made by the borrower to support a request for discharge;</P>
              <P>(ii) Produce any documents reasonably available to the borrower with respect to those representations; and</P>
              <P>(iii) If required by the Secretary, provide a sworn statement regarding those documents and representations.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary denies the request for a discharge or revokes the discharge of a borrower who—</P>
              <P>(i) Fails to provide the testimony, documents, or a sworn statement required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Transfer to the Secretary of borrower's right of recovery against third parties.</E> (1) Upon discharge under this section, the borrower is deemed to have assigned to and relinquished in favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) that the borrower (or student) may have by contract or applicable law with respect to the loan or the enrollment agreement for the program for which the loan was received, against the school, its principals, its affiliates and their successors, its sureties, and any private fund, including the portion of a public fund that represents funds received from a private party.</P>

              <P>(2) The provisions of this section apply notwithstanding any provision of State law that would otherwise restrict <PRTPAGE P="288"/>transfer of those rights by the borrower (or student), limit or prevent a transferee from exercising those rights, or establish procedures or a scheme of distribution that would prejudice the Secretary's ability to recover on those rights.</P>

              <P>(2) If the borrower's current address is known, the Secretary mails the borrower a discharge application and an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The Secretary also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the borrower on any affected loan. The Secretary may continue to receive borrower payments.</P>
              <P>(3) If the borrower's current address is unknown, the Secretary attempts to locate the borrower and determines the borrower's potential eligibility for a discharge under this section by consulting with representatives of the closed school, the school's licensing agency, the school's accrediting agency, and other appropriate parties. If the Secretary learns the new address of a borrower, the Secretary mails to the borrower a discharge application and explanation and suspends collection, as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) If a borrower fails to submit the application described in paragraph (c) of this section within 60 days of the Secretary's providing the discharge application, the Secretary resumes collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest for the period in which collection activity was suspended. The Secretary may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period.</P>
              <P>(5) Upon resuming collection on any affected loan, the Secretary provides the borrower another discharge application and an explanation of the requirements and procedures for obtaining a discharge.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for discharge</E>—(1) <E T="03">False certification.</E> The Secretary discharges a borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan in accordance with the provisions of this section if a school falsely certifies the eligibility of the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) to receive the proceeds of a Direct Loan. The Secretary considers a student's eligibility to borrow to have been falsely certified by the school if the school—</P>
              <P>(i) Certified the eligibility of a student who—</P>
              <P>(A) Reported not having a high school diploma or its equivalent; and</P>
              <P>(B) Did not satisfy the alternative to graduation from high school requirements under section 484(d) of the Act that were in effect at the time of certification;</P>
              <P>(ii) Certified the eligibility of a student who is not a high school graduate based on—</P>
              <P>(A) A high school graduation status falsified by the school; or</P>

              <P>(B) A high school diploma falsified by the school or a third party to which the school referred the borrower;<PRTPAGE P="289"/>
              </P>

              <P>(iv) Certified the eligibility of the student who, because of a physical or mental condition, age, criminal record, or other reason accepted by the Secretary, would not meet State requirements for employment (in the student's State of residence when the loan was originated) in the occupation for which the training program supported by the loan was intended; or</P>
              <P>(v) Certified the eligibility of a student for a Direct Loan as a result of the crime of identity theft committed against the individual, as that crime is defined in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Unauthorized payment.</E> The Secretary discharges a borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan if the school, without the borrower's authorization, endorsed the borrower's loan check or signed the borrower's authorization for electronic funds transfer, unless the proceeds of the loan were delivered to the student or applied to charges owed by the student to the school.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Relief pursuant to discharge.</E> (1) Discharge for false certification under paragraph (a)(1) of this section relieves the borrower of any past or present obligation to repay the loan and any accrued charges and collection costs with respect to the loan.</P>

              <P>(4) The Secretary does not regard a borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under this section as in default on the loan after discharge, and such a borrower is eligible to receive assistance under programs authorized by title IV of the Act.</P>
              <P>(5) The Secretary reports the discharge under this section to all consumer reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Borrower qualification for discharge.</E> To qualify for discharge under this section, the borrower must submit to the Secretary an application for discharge on a form approved by the Secretary. The application need not be notarized but must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury; and in the application, the borrower's responses must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the requirements in paragraph (c)(1) through (7) of this section have been met. If the Secretary determines the application does not meet the requirements, the Secretary notifies the applicant and explains why the application does not meet the requirements.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">High school diploma or equivalent.</E> In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge based on not having had a high school diploma and not having met the alternative to graduation from high school eligibility requirements under section 484(d) of the Act applicable at the time the loan was originated, and the school or a third party to which the school referred the borrower falsified the student's high school diploma, the borrower must state in the application that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent received a PLUS loan)—</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Disqualifying condition.</E> In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge based on a condition that would disqualify the borrower from employment in the occupation that the training program for which the borrower received the loan was intended, the borrower must state in the application that the borrower (or student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan)—</P>

              <P>(i) Did not meet State requirements for employment (in the student's State of residence) in the occupation that the <PRTPAGE P="290"/>training program for which the borrower received the loan was intended because of a physical or mental condition, age, criminal record, or other reason accepted by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Unauthorized loan.</E> In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge because the school signed the borrower's name on the loan application or promissory note without the borrower's authorization, the borrower must—</P>

              <P>(iii) State that the proceeds of the contested disbursement were not delivered to the student or applied to charges owed by the student to the school.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Identity theft.</E> (i) In the case of an individual whose eligibility to borrow was falsely certified because he or she was a victim of the crime of identity theft and is requesting a discharge, the individual must—</P>
              <P>(A) Certify that the individual did not sign the promissory note, or that any other means of identification used to obtain the loan was used without the authorization of the individual claiming relief;</P>
              <P>(B) Certify that the individual did not receive or benefit from the proceeds of the loan with knowledge that the loan had been made without the authorization of the individual;</P>
              <P>(C) Provide a copy of a local, State, or Federal court verdict or judgment that conclusively determines that the individual who is named as the borrower of the loan was the victim of a crime of identity theft; and</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Authentic specimens of the signature of the individual, as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, or of other means of identification of the individual, as applicable, corresponding to the means of identification falsely used to obtain the loan; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A statement of facts that demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that eligibility for the loan in question was falsely certified as a result of the crime of identity theft committed against that individual.</P>

              <P>(B) Identifying information includes, but is not limited to—</P>

              <P>(7) <E T="03">Cooperation with Secretary.</E> The borrower must state that the borrower (or student)—<PRTPAGE P="291"/>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of amount eligible for discharge.</E> (1) The Secretary determines the amount eligible for discharge based on information showing the refund amount or by applying the appropriate refund formula to information that the borrower provides or that is otherwise available to the Secretary. For purposes of this section, all unpaid refunds are considered to be attributed to loan proceeds.</P>
              <P>(2) If the information in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is not available, the Secretary uses the following formulas to determine the amount eligible for discharge:</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of a student who fails to attend or whose withdrawal or termination date is before October 7, 2000 and who completes less than 60 percent of the loan period, the Secretary discharges the lesser of the institutional charges unearned or the loan amount. The Secretary determines the amount of the institutional charges unearned by—</P>

              <P>(A) Calculating the ratio of the amount of time remaining in the loan <PRTPAGE P="293"/>period after the student's last day of attendance to the actual length of the loan period; and</P>
              <P>(B) Multiplying the resulting factor by the institutional charges assessed the student for the loan period.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of a student who fails to attend or whose withdrawal or termination date is on or after October 7, 2000 and who completes less than 60 percent of the loan period, the Secretary discharges the loan amount unearned. The Secretary determines the loan amount unearned by—</P>
              <P>(A) Calculating the ratio of the amount of time remaining in the loan period after the student's last day of attendance to the actual length of the loan period; and</P>
              <P>(B) Multiplying the resulting factor by the total amount of title IV grants and loans received by the student, or, if unknown, the loan amount.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of a student who completes 60 percent or more of the loan period, the Secretary does not discharge any amount because a student who completes 60 percent or more of the loan period is not entitled to a refund.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Discharge procedures.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the Secretary learns that a school did not make a refund of loan proceeds owed under applicable law and regulations, the Secretary sends the borrower a discharge application and an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The Secretary also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the borrower on any affected loan. The Secretary may continue to receive borrower payments.</P>
              <P>(2) If a borrower who is sent a discharge application fails to submit the application within 60 days of the Secretary's sending the discharge application, the Secretary resumes collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest for the period in which collection activity was suspended. The Secretary may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period.</P>
              <P>(3) If a borrower qualifies for a discharge, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing. The Secretary resumes collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest on the portion of the loan not discharged for the period in which collection activity was suspended. The Secretary may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period.</P>
              <P>(4) If a borrower does not qualify for a discharge, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of the reasons for the determination.

              <P>(iii) The lender of the other educational loan may not be an individual.</P>
              <P>(4) A Direct Consolidation Loan that was made based on an application received before July 1, 2006 receives a grace period if it includes a Direct Loan Program or FFEL Program loan for which the borrower was in an in-school period at the time of consolidation.

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Adjusted gross income (AGI)</E> means the borrower's adjusted gross income as reported to the Internal Revenue Service. For a married borrower filing jointly, AGI includes both the borrower's and spouse's income. For a married borrower filing separately, AGI includes only the borrower's income.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Eligible loan</E> means any outstanding loan made to a borrower under the FFEL or Direct Loan programs except for a defaulted loan, a FFEL or Direct PLUS Loan made to a parent borrower, or a FFEL or Direct Consolidation Loan that repaid a FFEL or Direct PLUS Loan made to a parent borrower.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Family size</E> means the number that is determined by counting the borrower, the borrower's spouse, and the borrower's children, including unborn children who will be born during the year the borrower certifies family size, if the children receive more than half their support from the borrower. A borrower's family size includes other individuals if, at the time the borrower certifies family size, the other individuals—</P>
              <P>(i) Live with the borrower; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Receive more than half their support from the borrower and will continue to receive this support from the borrower for the year the borrower certifies family size. Support includes money, gifts, loans, housing, food, clothes, car, medical and dental care, and payment of college costs.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">New borrower</E> means an individual who has no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan Program or FFEL Program loan on July 1, 2014, or who has no outstanding balance on such a loan on the date he or she obtains a loan after July 1, 2014.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Partial financial hardship</E> means a circumstance in which—</P>
              <P>(i) For an unmarried borrower or a married borrower who files an individual Federal tax return, the annual amount due on all of the borrower's eligible loans, as calculated under a standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period, using the greater of the amount due at the time the borrower initially entered repayment or at the time the borrower elects the income-based repayment plan, exceeds 15 percent or, for a new borrower, 10 percent of the difference between the borrower's AGI and 150 percent of the poverty guideline for the borrower's family size; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For a married borrower who files a joint Federal tax return with his or her spouse, the annual amount due on all of the borrower's eligible loans and, if applicable, the spouse's eligible loans, as calculated under a standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period, using the greater of the amount due at the time the loans initially entered repayment or at the time the borrower or spouse elects the income-based repayment plan, exceeds 15 percent or, for a new borrower, 10 percent of the difference between the borrower's and spouse's AGI, and 150 percent of the poverty guideline for the borrower's family size.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Poverty guideline</E> refers to the income categorized by State and family size in the poverty guidelines published annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902(2). If a borrower is not a resident of a State identified in the poverty guidelines, the poverty guideline to be used for the <PRTPAGE P="308"/>borrower is the poverty guideline (for the relevant family size) used for the 48 contiguous States.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Terms of the repayment plan.</E> (1) A borrower may select the income-based repayment plan only if the borrower has a partial financial hardship. The borrower's aggregate monthly loan payments are limited to no more than 15 percent or, for a new borrower, 10 percent of the amount by which the borrower's AGI exceeds 150 percent of the poverty guideline applicable to the borrower's family size, divided by 12.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary adjusts the calculated monthly payment if—</P>
              <P>(i) Except for borrowers provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the total amount of the borrower's eligible loans are not Direct Loans, in which case the Secretary determines the borrower's adjusted monthly payment by multiplying the calculated payment by the percentage of the total outstanding principal amount of the borrower's eligible loans that are Direct Loans;</P>
              <P>(ii) Both the borrower and borrower's spouse have eligible loans and filed a joint Federal tax return, in which case the Secretary determines—</P>
              <P>(A) Each borrower's percentage of the couple's total eligible loan debt;</P>
              <P>(B) The adjusted monthly payment for each borrower by multiplying the calculated payment by the percentage determined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(C) If the borrower's loans are held by multiple holders, the borrower's adjusted monthly Direct Loan payment by multiplying the payment determined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section by the percentage of the total outstanding principal amount of the borrower's eligible loans that are Direct Loans;</P>
              <P>(iii) The calculated amount under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2)(i), or (b)(2)(ii) of this section is less than $5.00, in which case the borrower's monthly payment is $0.00; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The calculated amount under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2)(i), or (b)(2)(ii) of this section is equal to or greater than $5.00 but less than $10.00, in which case the borrower's monthly payment is $10.00.</P>
              <P>(3) If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay the accrued interest on the borrower's Direct Subsidized loan or the subsidized portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan, the Secretary does not charge the borrower the remaining accrued interest for a period not to exceed three consecutive years from the established repayment period start date on that loan under the income-based repayment plan. Any period during which the Secretary has previously not charged the borrower accrued interest on an eligible loan under the Pay As You Earn repayment plan or the Revised Pay As You Earn repayment plan counts toward the maximum three years of subsidy a borrower is eligible to receive under the income-based repayment plan. On a Direct Consolidation Loan that repays loans on which the Secretary has not charged the borrower accrued interest, the three-year period includes the period for which the Secretary did not charge the borrower accrued interest on the underlying loans. This three-year period does not include any period during which the borrower receives an economic hardship deferment.</P>
              <P>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, accrued interest is capitalized at the time a borrower chooses to leave the income-based repayment plan or no longer has a partial financial hardship.</P>
              <P>(5) If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay any of the principal due, the payment of that principal is postponed until the borrower chooses to leave the income-based repayment plan or no longer has a partial financial hardship.</P>
              <P>(6) The repayment period for a borrower under the income-based repayment plan may be greater than 10 years.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment application and prepayment.</E> (1) The Secretary applies any payment made under the income-based repayment plan in the following order:</P>
              <P>(i) Accrued interest.</P>
              <P>(ii) Collection costs.</P>
              <P>(iii) Late charges.</P>
              <P>(iv) Loan principal.</P>

              <P>(2) The borrower may prepay all or part of a loan at any time without penalty, as provided under § 685.211(a)(2).<PRTPAGE P="309"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) If the prepayment amount equals or exceeds a monthly payment amount of $10.00 or more under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the Secretary applies the prepayment consistent with the requirements of § 685.211(a)(3).</P>
              <P>(4) If the prepayment amount exceeds a monthly payment amount of $0.00 under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the Secretary applies the prepayment consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Changes in the payment amount.</E> (1) If a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship, the borrower may continue to make payments under the income-based repayment plan, but the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment. The Secretary also recalculates the monthly payment for a borrower who chooses to stop making income-based payments. In either case, as result of the recalculation—</P>
              <P>(i) The maximum monthly amount that the Secretary requires the borrower to repay is the amount the borrower would have paid under the standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period using the amount of the borrower's eligible loans that was outstanding at the time the borrower began repayment on the loans under the income-based repayment plan; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The borrower's repayment period based on the recalculated payment amount may exceed 10 years.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) If a borrower no longer wishes to pay under the income-based repayment plan, the borrower must pay under the standard repayment plan and the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment based on—</P>
              <P>(A) For a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or a Direct PLUS Loan, the time remaining under the maximum ten-year repayment period for the amount of the borrower's loans that were outstanding at the time the borrower discontinued paying under the income-based repayment plan; or</P>
              <P>(B) For a Direct Consolidation Loan, the time remaining under the applicable repayment period as initially determined under § 685.208(j) and the amount of that loan that was outstanding at the time the borrower discontinued paying under the income-based repayment plan.</P>
              <P>(ii) A borrower who no longer wishes to repay under the income-based repayment plan and who is required to repay under the Direct Loan standard repayment plan in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section may request a change to a different repayment plan after making one monthly payment under the Direct Loan standard repayment plan. For this purpose, a monthly payment may include one payment made under a forbearance that provides for accepting smaller payments than previously scheduled, in accordance with § 685.205(a).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Eligibility documentation, verification, and notifications.</E> (1) The Secretary determines whether a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the income-based repayment plan for the year the borrower selects the plan and for each subsequent year that the borrower remains on the plan. To make this determination, the Secretary requires the borrower to—</P>
              <P>(i) Provide documentation, acceptable to the Secretary, of the borrower's AGI;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the borrower's AGI is not available, or the Secretary believes that the borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current income, provide other documentation to verify income; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Annually certify the borrower's family size. If the borrower fails to certify family size, the Secretary assumes a family size of one for that year.</P>
              <P>(2) After making a determination that a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the income-based repayment plan for the year the borrower initially elects the plan and for any subsequent year that the borrower has a partial financial hardship, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with—</P>

              <P>(i) The borrower's scheduled monthly payment amount, as calculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and the time period during which this scheduled monthly payment amount will apply (annual payment period);<PRTPAGE P="310"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Information about the requirement for the borrower to annually provide the information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if the borrower chooses to remain on the income-based repayment plan after the initial year on the plan, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified in advance of the date by which the Secretary must receive this information;</P>
              <P>(iii) An explanation of the consequences, as described in paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and (e)(7) of this section, if the borrower does not provide the required information;</P>
              <P>(iv) An explanation of the consequences if the borrower no longer wishes to repay under the income-based repayment plan; and</P>
              <P>(v) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time during the borrower's current annual payment period, that the Secretary recalculate the borrower's monthly payment amount if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount that was used to calculate the borrower's current monthly payment no longer reflects the borrower's current income. If the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment amount based on the borrower's request, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) For each subsequent year that a borrower who currently has a partial financial hardship remains on the income-based repayment plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of the requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section no later than 60 days and no earlier than 90 days prior to the date specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. The notification provides the borrower with—</P>
              <P>(i) The date, no earlier than 35 days before the end of the borrower's annual payment period, by which the Secretary must receive all of the information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (annual deadline); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The consequences if the Secretary does not receive the information within 10 days following the annual deadline specified in the notice, including the borrower's new monthly payment amount as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the effective date for the recalculated monthly payment amount, and the fact that unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized at the end of the borrower's current annual payment period in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Each time the Secretary makes a determination that a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship for a subsequent year that the borrower wishes to remain on the plan, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with—</P>
              <P>(i) The borrower's recalculated monthly payment amount, as determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) An explanation that unpaid interest will be capitalized in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time, that the Secretary redetermine whether the borrower has a partial financial hardship, if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount used to determine that the borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship does not reflect the borrower's current income, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified annually of this option. If the Secretary determines that the borrower again has a partial financial hardship, the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) For each subsequent year that a borrower who does not currently have a partial financial hardship remains on the income-based repayment plan, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(6) If a borrower who is currently repaying under another repayment plan selects the income-based repayment <PRTPAGE P="311"/>plan but does not provide the information described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section, or if the Secretary determines that the borrower does not have a partial financial hardship, the borrower remains on his or her current repayment plan.</P>
              <P>(7) The Secretary designates the repayment option described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section if a borrower who is currently repaying under the income-based repayment plan remains on the plan for a subsequent year but the Secretary does not receive the information described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(ii) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline, unless the Secretary is able to determine the borrower's new monthly payment amount before the end of the borrower's current annual payment period.</P>
              <P>(8) If the Secretary receives the information described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section within 10 days of the specified annual deadline—</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary promptly determines the borrower's new scheduled monthly payment amount and maintains the borrower's current scheduled monthly payment amount until the new scheduled monthly payment amount is determined.</P>
              <P>(A) If the new monthly payment amount is less than the borrower's previously calculated income-based monthly payment amount, and the borrower made payments at the previously calculated amount after the end of the most recent annual payment period, the Secretary makes the appropriate adjustment to the borrower's account. Notwithstanding the requirements of § 685.211(a)(3), unless the borrower requests otherwise, the Secretary applies the excess payment amounts made after the end of the most recent annual payment period in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) If the new monthly payment amount is equal to or greater than the borrower's previously calculated monthly payment amount, and the borrower made payments at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the most recent annual payment period, the Secretary does not make any adjustment to the borrower's account.</P>
              <P>(C) Any payments that the borrower continued to make at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the prior annual payment period and before the new monthly payment amount is calculated are considered to be qualifying payments for purposes of § 685.219, provided that the payments otherwise meet the requirements described in § 685.219(c)(1).</P>
              <P>(ii) The new annual payment period begins on the day after the end of the most recent annual payment period.</P>
              <P>(9)(i) If the Secretary receives the documentation described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section more than 10 days after the specified annual deadline and the borrower's monthly payment amount is recalculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Secretary grants forbearance with respect to payments that are overdue or would be due at the time the new calculated income-based monthly payment amount is determined, if the new monthly payment amount is $0.00 or is less than the borrower's previously calculated income-based monthly payment amount. Interest that accrues during the portion of this forbearance period that covers payments that are overdue after the end of the prior annual payment period is not capitalized.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any payments that the borrower continued to make at the previously calculated payment amount after the end of the prior annual payment period and before the new monthly payment amount is calculated are considered to be qualifying payments for purposes of § 685.219, provided that the payments otherwise meet the requirements described in § 685.219(c)(1).</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 685.222</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Borrower defenses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) For loans first disbursed prior to July 1, 2017, a borrower asserts and the Secretary considers a borrower defense in accordance with the provisions of § 685.206(c), unless otherwise noted in § 685.206(c).</P>
              <P>(2) For loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2017, a borrower asserts and the Secretary considers a borrower defense in accordance with this section. To establish a borrower defense under this section, a preponderance of the evidence must show that the borrower has a borrower defense that meets the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) A violation by the school of an eligibility or compliance requirement in the Act or its implementing regulations is not a basis for a borrower defense under either this section or § 685.206(c) unless the violation would otherwise constitute a basis for a borrower defense under this section or § 685.206(c), as applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) For the purposes of this section and § 685.206(c), “borrower” means—</P>
              <P>(i) The borrower; and</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of a Direct PLUS Loan, any endorsers, and for a Direct PLUS Loan made to a parent, the student on whose behalf the parent borrowed.</P>
              <P>(5) For the purposes of this section and § 685.206(c), a “borrower defense” refers to an act or omission of the school attended by the student that relates to the making of a Direct Loan for enrollment at the school or the provision of educational services for which the loan was provided, and includes one or both of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A defense to repayment of amounts owed to the Secretary on a Direct Loan, in whole or in part; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A right to recover amounts previously collected by the Secretary on the Direct Loan, in whole or in part.</P>
              <P>(6) If the borrower asserts both a borrower defense and any other objection to an action of the Secretary with regard to that Direct Loan, the order in which the Secretary will consider objections, including a borrower defense, will be determined as appropriate under the circumstances.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Judgment against the school.</E> The borrower has a borrower defense if the borrower, whether as an individual or as a member of a class, or a governmental agency, has obtained against the school a nondefault, favorable contested judgment based on State or Federal law in a court or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction. A borrower may assert a borrower defense under this paragraph at any time.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Breach of contract by the school.</E> The borrower has a borrower defense if the school the borrower received the <PRTPAGE P="314"/>Direct Loan to attend failed to perform its obligations under the terms of a contract with the student. A borrower may assert a defense to repayment of amounts owed to the Secretary under this paragraph at any time after the breach by the school of its contract with the student. A borrower may assert a right to recover amounts previously collected by the Secretary under this paragraph not later than six years after the breach by the school of its contract with the student.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Substantial misrepresentation by the school.</E> (1) A borrower has a borrower defense if the school or any of its representatives, or any institution, organization, or person with whom the school has an agreement to provide educational programs, or to provide marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services, made a substantial misrepresentation in accordance with 34 CFR part 668, subpart F, that the borrower reasonably relied on to the borrower's detriment when the borrower decided to attend, or to continue attending, the school or decided to take out a Direct Loan. A borrower may assert, at any time, a defense to repayment under this paragraph (d) of amounts owed to the Secretary. A borrower may assert a claim under this paragraph (d) to recover funds previously collected by the Secretary not later than six years after the borrower discovers, or reasonably could have discovered, the information constituting the substantial misrepresentation.</P>
              <P>(2) For the purposes of this section, a designated Department official pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section or a hearing official pursuant to paragraph (f), (g), or (h) of this section may consider, as evidence supporting the reasonableness of a borrower's reliance on a misrepresentation, whether the school or any of the other parties described in paragraph (d)(1) engaged in conduct such as, but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) Demanding that the borrower make enrollment or loan-related decisions immediately;</P>
              <P>(ii) Placing an unreasonable emphasis on unfavorable consequences of delay;</P>
              <P>(iii) Discouraging the borrower from consulting an adviser, a family member, or other resource;</P>
              <P>(iv) Failing to respond to the borrower's requests for more information including about the cost of the program and the nature of any financial aid; or</P>
              <P>(v) Otherwise unreasonably pressuring the borrower or taking advantage of the borrower's distress or lack of knowledge or sophistication.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedure for an individual borrower.</E> (1) To assert a borrower defense under this section, an individual borrower must—</P>
              <P>(i) Submit an application to the Secretary, on a form approved by the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(A) Certifying that the borrower received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, to attend the named school;</P>
              <P>(B) Providing evidence that supports the borrower defense; and</P>
              <P>(C) Indicating whether the borrower has made a claim with respect to the information underlying the borrower defense with any third party, such as the holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, if so, the amount of any payment received by the borrower or credited to the borrower's loan obligation; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide any other information or supporting documentation reasonably requested by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon receipt of a borrower's application, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(i) If the borrower is not in default on the loan for which a borrower defense has been asserted, grants forbearance and—</P>
              <P>(A) Notifies the borrower of the option to decline the forbearance and to continue making payments on the loan; and</P>
              <P>(B) Provides the borrower with information about the availability of the income-contingent repayment plans under § 685.209 and the income-based repayment plan under § 685.221; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If the borrower is in default on the loan for which a borrower defense has been asserted—</P>
              <P>(A) Suspends collection activity on the loan until the Secretary issues a decision on the borrower's claim;</P>

              <P>(B) Notifies the borrower of the suspension of collection activity and explains that collection activity will resume if the Secretary determines that <PRTPAGE P="315"/>the borrower does not qualify for a full discharge; and</P>
              <P>(C) Notifies the borrower of the option to continue making payments under a rehabilitation agreement or other repayment agreement on the defaulted loan.</P>
              <P>(3) The Secretary designates a Department official to review the borrower's application to determine whether the application states a basis for a borrower defense, and resolves the claim through a fact-finding process conducted by the Department official.</P>
              <P>(i) As part of the fact-finding process, the Department official notifies the school of the borrower defense application and considers any evidence or argument presented by the borrower and also any additional information, including—</P>
              <P>(A) Department records;</P>
              <P>(B) Any response or submissions from the school; and</P>
              <P>(C) Any additional information or argument that may be obtained by the Department official.</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon the borrower's request, the Department official identifies to the borrower the records the Department official considers relevant to the borrower defense. The Secretary provides to the borrower any of the identified records upon reasonable request of the borrower.</P>
              <P>(4) At the conclusion of the fact-finding process, the Department official issues a written decision as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If the Department official approves the borrower defense in full or in part, the Department official notifies the borrower in writing of that determination and of the relief provided as described in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the Department official denies the borrower defense in full or in part, the Department official notifies the borrower of the reasons for the denial, the evidence that was relied upon, any portion of the loan that is due and payable to the Secretary, and whether the Secretary will reimburse any amounts previously collected, and informs the borrower that if any balance remains on the loan, the loan will return to its status prior to the borrower's submission of the application. The Department official also informs the borrower of the opportunity to request reconsideration of the claim based on new evidence pursuant to paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) The decision of the Department official is final as to the merits of the claim and any relief that may be granted on the claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing—</P>
              <P>(i) If the borrower defense is denied in full or in part, the borrower may request that the Secretary reconsider the borrower defense upon the identification of new evidence in support of the borrower's claim. “New evidence” is relevant evidence that the borrower did not previously provide and that was not identified in the final decision as evidence that was relied upon for the final decision. If accepted for reconsideration by the Secretary, the Secretary follows the procedure in paragraph (e)(2) of this section for granting forbearance and for defaulted loans; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary may reopen a borrower defense application at any time to consider evidence that was not considered in making the previous decision. If a borrower defense application is reopened by the Secretary, the Secretary follows the procedure paragraph (e)(2) of this section for granting forbearance and for defaulted loans.</P>
              <P>(6) The Secretary may consolidate applications filed under this paragraph (e) that have common facts and claims, and resolve the borrowers' borrower defense claims as provided in paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) The Secretary may initiate a proceeding to collect from the school the amount of relief resulting from a borrower defense under this section—</P>
              <P>(i) Within the six-year period applicable to the borrower defense under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) At any time, for a borrower defense under paragraph (b) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(iii) At any time if during the period described in paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section, the institution received notice of the claim. For purposes of this paragraph, notice includes receipt of—</P>

              <P>(A) Actual notice from the borrower, a representative of the borrower, or the Department of a claim, including notice of an application filed pursuant to this section or § 685.206(c);<PRTPAGE P="316"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) A class action complaint asserting relief for a class that may include the borrower for underlying facts that may form the basis of a claim under this section or § 685.206(c);</P>
              <P>(C) Written notice, including a civil investigative demand or other written demand for information, from a Federal or State agency that has power to initiate an investigation into conduct of the school relating to specific programs, periods, or practices that may have affected the borrower, for underlying facts that may form the basis of a claim under this section or § 685.206(c).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Group process for borrower defense, generally.</E> (1) Upon consideration of factors including, but not limited to, common facts and claims, fiscal impact, and the promotion of compliance by the school or other title IV, HEA program participant, the Secretary may initiate a process to determine whether a group of borrowers, identified by the Secretary, has a borrower defense.</P>
              <P>(i) The members of the group may be identified by the Secretary from individually filed applications pursuant to paragraph (e)(6) of this section or from any other source.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the Secretary determines that there are common facts and claims that apply to borrowers who have not filed an application under paragraph (e) of this section, the Secretary may identify such borrowers as members of a group.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon the identification of a group of borrowers under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(i) Designates a Department official to present the group's claim in the fact-finding process described in paragraph (g) or (h) of this section, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(ii) Provides each identified member of the group with notice that allows the borrower to opt out of the proceeding;</P>
              <P>(iii) If identified members of the group are borrowers who have not filed an application under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, follows the procedures in paragraph (e)(2) of this section for granting forbearance and for defaulted loans for such identified members of the group, unless an opt-out by such a member of the group is received; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Notifies the school of the basis of the group's borrower defense, the initiation of the fact-finding process described in paragraph (g) or (h) of this section, and of any procedure by which the school may request records and respond. No notice will be provided if notice is impossible or irrelevant due to a school's closure.</P>
              <P>(3) For a group of borrowers identified by the Secretary, for which the Secretary determines that there may be a borrower defense under paragraph (d) of this section based upon a substantial misrepresentation that has been widely disseminated, there is a rebuttable presumption that each member reasonably relied on the misrepresentation.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Procedures for group process for borrower defenses with respect to loans made to attend a closed school.</E> For groups identified by the Secretary under paragraph (f) of this section, for which the borrower defense is asserted with respect to a Direct Loan to attend a school that has closed and has provided no financial protection currently available to the Secretary from which to recover any losses arising from borrower defenses, and for which there is no appropriate entity from which the Secretary can otherwise practicably recover such losses—</P>
              <P>(1) A hearing official resolves the borrower defense through a fact-finding process. As part of the fact-finding process, the hearing official considers any evidence and argument presented by the Department official on behalf of the group and, as necessary to determine any claims at issue, on behalf of individual members of the group. The hearing official also considers any additional information the Department official considers necessary, including any Department records or response from the school or a person affiliated with the school as described in § 668.174(b), if practicable. The hearing official issues a written decision as follows:</P>

              <P>(i) If the hearing official approves the borrower defense in full or in part, the written decision states that determination and the relief provided on the <PRTPAGE P="317"/>basis of that claim as determined under paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the hearing official denies the borrower defense in full or in part, the written decision states the reasons for the denial, the evidence that was relied upon, the portion of the loans that are due and payable to the Secretary, and whether reimbursement of amounts previously collected is granted, and informs the borrowers that if any balance remains on the loan, the loan will return to its status prior to the group claim process.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Secretary provides copies of the written decision to the members of the group and, as practicable, to the school.</P>
              <P>(2) The decision of the hearing official is final as to the merits of the group borrower defense and any relief that may be granted on the group claim.</P>
              <P>(3) After a final decision has been issued, if relief for the group has been denied in full or in part pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, an individual borrower may file a claim for relief pursuant to paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The Secretary may reopen a borrower defense application at any time to consider evidence that was not considered in making the previous decision. If a borrower defense application is reopened by the Secretary, the Secretary follows the procedure in paragraph (e)(2) of this section for granting forbearance and for defaulted loans.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Procedures for group process for borrower defenses with respect to loans made to attend an open school.</E> For groups identified by the Secretary under paragraph (f) of this section, for which the borrower defense is asserted with respect to Direct Loans to attend a school that is not covered by paragraph (g) of this section, the claim is resolved in accordance with the procedures in this paragraph (h).</P>
              <P>(1) A hearing official resolves the borrower defense and determines any liability of the school through a fact-finding process. As part of the fact-finding process, the hearing official considers any evidence and argument presented by the school and the Department official on behalf of the group and, as necessary to determine any claims at issue, on behalf of individual members of the group. The hearing official issues a written decision as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If the hearing official approves the borrower defense in full or in part, the written decision establishes the basis for the determination, notifies the members of the group of the relief as described in paragraph (i) of this section, and notifies the school of any liability to the Secretary for the amounts discharged and reimbursed.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the hearing official denies the borrower defense for the group in full or in part, the written decision states the reasons for the denial, the evidence that was relied upon, the portion of the loans that are due and payable to the Secretary, and whether reimbursement of amounts previously collected is granted, and informs the borrowers that their loans will return to their statuses prior to the group borrower defense process. The decision notifies the school of any liability to the Secretary for any amounts discharged or reimbursed.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Secretary provides copies of the written decision to the members of the group, the Department official, and the school.</P>
              <P>(2) The decision of the hearing official becomes final as to the merits of the group borrower defense and any relief that may be granted on the group borrower defense within 30 days after the decision is issued and received by the Department official and the school unless, within that 30-day period, the school or the Department official appeals the decision to the Secretary. In the case of an appeal—</P>
              <P>(i) The decision of the hearing official does not take effect pending the appeal; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary renders a final decision.</P>
              <P>(3) After a final decision has been issued, if relief for the group has been denied in full or in part pursuant to paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, an individual borrower may file a claim for relief pursuant to paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section.</P>

              <P>(4) The Secretary may reopen a borrower defense application at any time <PRTPAGE P="318"/>to consider evidence that was not considered in making the previous decision. If a borrower defense application is reopened by the Secretary, the Secretary follows the procedure in paragraph (e)(2) of this section for granting forbearance and for defaulted loans.</P>
              <P>(5)(i) The Secretary collects from the school any liability to the Secretary for any amounts discharged or reimbursed to borrowers under this paragraph (h).</P>
              <P>(ii) For a borrower defense under paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary may initiate a proceeding to collect at any time.</P>
              <P>(iii) For a borrower defense under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the Secretary may initiate a proceeding to collect within the limitation period that would apply to the borrower defense, provided that the Secretary may bring an action to collect at any time if, within the limitation period, the school received notice of the borrower's borrower defense claim. For purposes of this paragraph, the school receives notice of the borrower's claim by receipt of—</P>

              <P>(B) A class action complaint asserting relief for a class that may include the borrower for underlying facts that may form the basis of a claim under this section or § 685.206(c); or</P>
              <P>(C) Written notice, including a civil investigative demand or other written demand for information, from a Federal or State agency that has power to initiate an investigation into conduct of the school relating to specific programs, periods, or practices that may have affected the borrower, of underlying facts that may form the basis of a claim under this section or § 685.206(c).</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Relief.</E> If a borrower defense is approved under the procedures in paragraph (e), (g), or (h) of this section, the following procedures apply:</P>
              <P>(1) The Department official or the hearing official deciding the claim determines the appropriate amount of relief to award the borrower, which may be a discharge of all amounts owed to the Secretary on the loan at issue and may include the recovery of amounts previously collected by the Secretary on the loan, or some lesser amount.</P>
              <P>(2) For a borrower defense brought on the basis of—</P>
              <P>(i) A substantial misrepresentation, the Department official or the hearing official will factor the borrower's cost of attendance to attend the school, as well as the value of the education the borrower received, the value of the education that a reasonable borrower in the borrower's circumstances would have received, and/or the value of the education the borrower should have expected given the information provided by the institution, into the determination of appropriate relief. A borrower may be granted full, partial, or no relief. Value will be assessed in a manner that is reasonable and practicable. In addition, the Department official or the hearing official deciding the claim may consider any other relevant factors;</P>
              <P>(ii) A judgment against the school—</P>
              <P>(A) Where the judgment awards specific financial relief, relief will be the amount of the judgment that remains unsatisfied, subject to the limitation provided for in § 685.222(i)(8) and any other reasonable considerations; and</P>
              <P>(B) Where the judgment does not award specific financial relief, the Department will rely on the holding of the case and applicable law to monetize the judgment; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A breach of contract, relief will be determined according to the common law of contracts, subject to the limitation provided for in § 685.222(i)(8) and any other reasonable considerations.</P>
              <P>(3) In a fact-finding process brought against an open school under paragraph (h) of this section on the basis of a substantial misrepresentation, the school has the burden of proof as to any value of the education.</P>
              <P>(4) In determining the relief, the Department official or the hearing official deciding the claim may consider—</P>
              <P>(i) Information derived from a sample of borrowers from the group when calculating relief for a group of borrowers; and</P>

              <P>(ii) The examples in Appendix A to this subpart.<PRTPAGE P="319"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) In the written decision described in paragraphs (e), (g), and (h) of this section, the designated Department official or hearing official deciding the claim notifies the borrower of the relief provided and—</P>
              <P>(i) Specifies the relief determination;</P>
              <P>(ii) Advises that there may be tax implications; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Advises the borrower of the requirements to file a request for reconsideration upon the identification of new evidence.</P>
              <P>(6) Consistent with the determination of relief under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the Secretary discharges the borrower's obligation to repay all or part of the loan and associated costs and fees that the borrower would otherwise be obligated to pay and, if applicable, reimburses the borrower for amounts paid toward the loan voluntarily or through enforced collection.</P>
              <P>(7) The Department official or the hearing official deciding the case, or the Secretary as applicable, affords the borrower such further relief as appropriate under the circumstances. Such further relief includes, but is not limited to, one or both of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Determining that the borrower is not in default on the loan and is eligible to receive assistance under title IV of the Act.</P>
              <P>(ii) Updating reports to consumer reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously made adverse credit reports with regard to the borrower's Direct Loan.</P>
              <P>(8) The total amount of relief granted with respect to a borrower defense cannot exceed the amount of the loan and any associated costs and fees and will be reduced by the amount of any refund, reimbursement, indemnification, restitution, compensatory damages, settlement, debt forgiveness, discharge, cancellation, compromise, or any other financial benefit received by, or on behalf of, the borrower that was related to the borrower defense. The relief to the borrower may not include non-pecuniary damages such as inconvenience, aggravation, emotional distress, or punitive damages.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Cooperation by the borrower.</E> To obtain relief under this section, a borrower must reasonably cooperate with the Secretary in any proceeding under paragraph (e), (g), or (h) of this section. The Secretary may revoke any relief granted to a borrower who fails to satisfy his or her obligations under this paragraph (j).</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Transfer to the Secretary of the borrower's right of recovery against third parties.</E> (1) Upon the granting of any relief under this section, the borrower is deemed to have assigned to, and relinquished in favor of, the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) that the borrower may have by contract or applicable law with respect to the loan or the contract for educational services for which the loan was received, against the school, its principals, its affiliates, and their successors, its sureties, and any private fund. If the borrower asserts a claim to, and recovers from, a public fund, the Secretary may reinstate the borrower's obligation to repay on the loan an amount based on the amount recovered from the public fund, if the Secretary determines that the borrower's recovery from the public fund was based on the same borrower defense and for the same loan for which the discharge was granted under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The provisions of this paragraph (k) apply notwithstanding any provision of State law that would otherwise restrict transfer of those rights by the borrower, limit or prevent a transferee from exercising those rights, or establish procedures or a scheme of distribution that would prejudice the Secretary's ability to recover on those rights.</P>
              <P>(3) Nothing in this paragraph (k) limits or forecloses the borrower's right to pursue legal and equitable relief against a party described in this paragraph (k) for recovery of any portion of a claim exceeding that assigned to the Secretary or any other claims arising from matters unrelated to the claim on which the loan is discharged.</P>

              <EAR>Pt. 685, Subpt. B, App. A</EAR>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Subpart B of Part 685—Examples of Borrower Relief</HD>
              <P>The Department official or the hearing official deciding a borrower defense claim determines the amount of relief to award the borrower, which may be a discharge of all amounts owed to the Secretary on the loan at issue and may include the recovery of amounts previously collected by the Secretary on the loan, or some lesser amount. The following are some conceptual examples demonstrating relief. The actual relief awarded will be determined by the Department official or the hearing official deciding the claim, who shall not be bound by these examples.</P>
              <P>1. A school represents to prospective students, in widely disseminated materials, that its educational program will lead to employment in an occupation that requires State licensure. The program does not in fact meet minimum education requirements to enable its graduates to sit for the exam necessary for them to obtain licensure. The claims are adjudicated in a group process.</P>
              <P>Appropriate relief: Borrowers who enrolled in this program during the time that the misrepresentation was made should receive full relief. As a result of the schools' misrepresentation, the borrowers cannot work in the occupation in which they reasonably expected to work when they enrolled. Accordingly, borrowers received limited or no value from this educational program because they did not receive the value that they reasonably expected.</P>
              <P>2. A school states to a prospective student that its medical assisting program has a faculty composed of skilled nurses and physicians and offers internships at a local hospital. The borrower enrolls in the school in reliance on that statement. In fact, none of the teachers at the school other than the Director is a nurse or physician. The school has no internship program. The teachers at the school are not qualified to teach medical assisting and the student is not qualified for medical assistant jobs based on the education received at the school.</P>
              <P>Appropriate relief: This borrower should receive full relief. None of the teachers at the school are qualified to teach medical assisting, and there was no internship. In contrast to reasonable students' expectations, based on information provided by the school, the typical borrower received no value from the program.</P>
              <P>3. An individual interested in becoming a registered nurse meets with a school's admissions counselor who explains that the school does not have a nursing program but that completion of a medical assisting program is a prerequisite for any nursing program. Based on this information, the borrower enrolls in the school's medical assisting program rather than searching for another nursing program, believing that completing a medical assisting program is a necessary step towards becoming a nurse. After one year in the program, the borrower realizes that it is not necessary to become a medical assistant before entering a nursing program. The borrower's credits are not transferrable to a nursing program.</P>
              <P>Appropriate relief: This borrower should receive full relief. Because it is not necessary to become a medical assistant prior to entering a nursing program, she has made no progress towards the career she sought, and in fact has received an education that cannot be used for its intended purpose.</P>
              <P>4. A school tells a prospective student, who is actively seeking an education, that the cost of the program will be $20,000. Relying on that statement, the borrower enrolls. The student later learns the cost for that year was $25,000. There is no evidence of any other misrepresentations in the enrollment process or of any deficiency in value in the school's education.</P>
              <P>Appropriate relief: This borrower should receive partial relief of $5,000. The borrower received precisely the value that she expected. The school provides the education that the student was seeking but misrepresented the price.</P>
              <P>5. A school represents in its marketing materials that three of its undergraduate faculty members in a particular program have received the highest award in their field. A borrower choosing among two comparable, selective programs enrolls in that program in reliance on the representation about its faculty. However, although the program otherwise remains the same, the school had failed to update the marketing materials to reflect the fact that the award-winning faculty had left the school.</P>
              <P>Appropriate relief: Although the borrower reasonably relied on a misrepresentation about the faculty in deciding to enroll at this school, she still received the value that she expected. Therefore, no relief is appropriate.</P>

              <P>6. An individual wishes to enroll in a selective, regionally accredited liberal arts school. The school gives inflated data to a well-regarded school ranking organization regarding the median grade point average of recent entrants and also includes that inflated data in its own marketing materials. This inflated data raises the place of the school in the organization's rankings in <PRTPAGE P="321"/>independent publications. The individual enrolls in the school and graduates. Soon after graduating, the individual learns from the news that the school falsified admissions data. Notwithstanding this issue, degrees from the school continue to serve as effective, well-regarded liberal arts credentials.</P>
              <P>The Department also determines that the school violated the title IV requirement that it not make substantial misrepresentations pursuant to 34 CFR 668.71, which constitutes an enforceable violation separate and apart from any borrower defense relief.</P>
              <P>Appropriate Relief: The borrower relied on the misrepresentation about the admissions data to his detriment, because the misrepresentation factored into the borrower's decision to choose the school over others. However, the borrower received a selective liberal arts education which represents the value that he could reasonably expect, and gets no relief.</P>

              <P>(i) Concerning the status of student borrowers (and students on whose behalf parents borrow) while these students are in attendance at the school;</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon request by the Secretary, concerning any new information of which the school becomes aware for these students (or their parents) after the student leaves the school; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Concerning student eligibility and need, for the alternative origination of loans to eligible students and parents in accordance with part D of the Act;</P>
              <P>(7) Provide assurances that the school will comply with requirements established by the Secretary relating to student loan information with respect to loans made under the Direct Loan Program;</P>
              <P>(8) Provide that the school will accept responsibility and financial liability stemming from its failure to perform its functions pursuant to the agreement;</P>
              <P>(9) Provide for the implementation of a quality assurance system, as established by the Secretary and developed in consultation with the school, to ensure that the school is complying with program requirements and meeting program objectives;</P>

              <P>(10) Provide that the school will not charge any fees of any kind, however <PRTPAGE P="322"/>described, to student or parent borrowers for origination activities or the provision of any information necessary for a student or parent to receive a loan under part D of the Act or any benefits associated with such a loan; and</P>
              <P>(11) Comply with the provisions of paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section regarding student claims and disputes.</P>
              <P>(12) Comply with other provisions that the Secretary determines are necessary to protect the interests of the United States and to promote the purposes of part D of the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Origination.</E> A school that originates loans in the Direct Loan Program must originate loans to eligible students and parents in accordance with part D of the Act. The note or evidence of the borrower's obligation on the loan originated by the school is the property of the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Borrower defense claims in an internal dispute process.</E> The school will not compel any student to pursue a complaint based on a borrower defense claim through an internal dispute process before the student presents the complaint to an accrediting agency or government agency authorized to hear the complaint.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Class action bans.</E> (1) The school will not seek to rely in any way on a predispute arbitration agreement or on any other predispute agreement with a student who has obtained or benefited from a Direct Loan, with respect to any aspect of a class action that is related to a borrower defense claim, including to seek a stay or dismissal of particular claims or the entire action, unless and until the presiding court has ruled that the case may not proceed as a class action and, if that ruling may be subject to appellate review on an interlocutory basis, the time to seek such review has elapsed or the review has been resolved.</P>

              <P>(v) Filing a claim in arbitration against a student who has filed a claim on the same issue in a class action after the trial court has denied a motion to certify the class but before an appellate court has ruled on an interlocutory appeal of that motion, if the time to seek such an appeal has not elapsed or the appeal has not been resolved.</P>
              <P>(vi) Filing a claim in arbitration against a student who has filed a claim on the same issue in a class action after the trial court in that class action has granted a motion to dismiss the claim and, in doing so, the court noted that the consumer has leave to refile the claim on a class basis, if the time to refile the claim has not elapsed.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Determining eligibility and loan amount.</E> (1) A school participating in the Direct Loan Program must ensure that any information it provides to the Secretary in connection with loan origination is complete and accurate. A school must originate a Direct Loan while the student meets the borrower eligibility requirements of § 685.200. Except as provided in 34 CFR part 668, subpart E, a school may rely in good faith upon statements made by the borrower and, in the case of a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower, the student and the parent borrower.</P>
              <P>(2) A school must provide to the Secretary borrower information that includes but is not limited to—</P>
              <P>(i) The borrower's eligibility for a loan, as determined in accordance with § 685.200 and § 685.203;</P>
              <P>(ii) The student's loan amount; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The anticipated and actual disbursement date or dates and disbursement amounts of the loan proceeds, as determined in accordance with § 685.303(d).</P>
              <P>(3) Before originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a graduate or professional student borrower, the school must determine the borrower's eligibility for a Direct Subsidized and a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. If the borrower is eligible for a Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, but has not requested the maximum Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount for which the borrower is eligible, the school must—</P>
              <P>(i) Notify the graduate or professional student borrower of the maximum Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount that he or she is eligible to receive and provide the borrower with a comparison of—</P>

              <P>(4) A school may not originate a Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Direct PLUS Loan, or a combination of loans, for an amount that—</P>
              <P>(i) The school has reason to know would result in the borrower exceeding the annual or maximum loan amounts in § 685.203; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Exceeds the student's estimated cost of attendance less—</P>
              <P>(A) The student's estimated financial assistance for that period; and</P>
              <P>(B) In the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan, the borrower's expected family contribution for that period.</P>
              <P>(5)(i) A school determines a Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount in accordance with § 685.203.</P>
              <P>(ii) When prorating a loan amount for a student enrolled in a program of study with less than a full academic year remaining, the school need not recalculate the amount of the loan if the number of hours for which an eligible student is enrolled changes after the school originates the loan.</P>
              <P>(6) The date of loan origination is the date a school creates the electronic loan origination record.</P>
              <P>(7) If a student has received a determination of need for a Direct Subsidized Loan that is $200 or less, a school may choose not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan for that student and to include the amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.</P>
              <P>(8) A school may refuse to originate a Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Direct PLUS Loan or may reduce the borrower's determination of need for the loan if the reason for that action is documented and provided to the borrower in writing, and if—</P>
              <P>(i) The determination is made on a case-by-case basis;</P>
              <P>(ii) The documentation supporting the determination is retained in the student's file; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The school does not engage in any pattern or practice that results in a denial of a borrower's access to Direct Loans because of the borrower's race, gender, color, religion, national origin, age, disability status, or income.</P>
              <P>(9) A school may not assess a fee for the completion or certification of any Direct Loan Program forms or information or for the origination of a Direct Loan.</P>
              <P>(10)(i) The minimum period of enrollment for which a school may originate a Direct Loan is—</P>
              <P>(A) At a school that measures academic progress in credit hours and uses a semester, trimester, or quarter system, or that has terms that are substantially equal in length with no term less than nine weeks in length, a single academic term (e.g., a semester or quarter); or</P>
              <P>(B) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) or (iii) of this section, at a school that measures academic progress in clock hours, or measures academic progress in credit hours but does not use a semester, trimester, or quarter system and does not have terms that are substantially equal in length with no term less than nine weeks in length, the lesser of—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The length of the student's program (or the remaining portion of that program if the student has less than the full program remaining) at the school; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The academic year as defined by the school in accordance with 34 CFR 668.3.</P>

              <P>(ii) For a student who transfers into a school from another school and the prior school originated a loan for a period of enrollment that overlaps the period of enrollment at the new school, the new school may originate a loan for the remaining portion of the program or academic year. In this case the school may originate a loan for an amount that does not exceed the remaining balance of the student's annual loan limit.<PRTPAGE P="327"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) For a student who completes a program at a school, where the student's last loan to complete that program had been for less than an academic year, and the student then begins a new program at the same school, the school may originate a loan for the remainder of the academic year. In this case the school may originate a loan for an amount that does not exceed the remaining balance of the student's annual loan limit at the loan level associated with the new program.</P>
              <P>(iv) The maximum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan is—</P>
              <P>(A) Generally an academic year, as defined by the school in accordance with 34 CFR 668.3, except that the school may use a longer period of time corresponding to the period to which the school applies the annual loan limits under § 685.203; or</P>
              <P>(B) For a defaulted borrower who has regained eligibility, the academic year in which the borrower regained eligibility.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Promissory note handling.</E> (1) The Secretary provides promissory notes for use in the Direct Loan Program. A school may not modify, or make any additions to, the promissory note without the Secretary's prior written approval.</P>

              <P>(ii) If a student delays attending school for a period of time, the school may consider that student to have maintained eligibility for the loan from the first day of the period of enrollment. However, the school must comply with the requirements under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) If, after a school makes the first disbursement to a borrower, the student becomes ineligible due solely to the school's loss of eligibility to participate in the title IV programs or the Direct Loan Program, the school may make subsequent disbursements to the borrower as permitted by 34 CFR part 668.</P>
              <P>(iv) If, prior to making any disbursement to a borrower, the student temporarily ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, the school may make a disbursement and any subsequent disbursement to the student if the school determines and documents in the student's file—</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope and purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The TEACH Grant program awards grants to students who intend to teach, to help meet the cost of their postsecondary education. In exchange for the grant, the student must agree to serve as a full-time teacher in a high-need field, in a school serving low-income students for at least four academic years within eight years of completing the program of study for which the student received the grant. If the student does not satisfy the service obligation, the amounts of the TEACH Grants received are treated as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan (Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan) and must be repaid with interest.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) Notwithstanding the limitation in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a student who would be a half-time student based solely on his or her correspondence work is considered a half-time student unless the calculation in paragraph (b) of this section produces an enrollment status greater than half-time.</P>
              <P>(2) A student who would be a less-than-half-time student based solely on his or her correspondence work or a combination of correspondence work and regular coursework is considered a less-than-half-time student.</P>

After referring the TEACH Grant overpayment to the Secretary under this section, the institution need make no further efforts to recover the overpayment.</P>

              <P>(1) He or she is employed as a full-time teacher in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement to serve described in § 686.12; or</P>

              <P>(b) If a grant recipient is performing full-time teaching service in accordance with the agreement to serve, or agreements to serve if more than one agreement exists, the grant recipient must, upon completion of each of the four required elementary or secondary academic years of teaching service, provide to the Secretary documentation of that teaching service on a form approved by the Secretary and certified by the chief administrative officer of the school in which the grant recipient is teaching. The documentation must show that the grant recipient is teaching in a low-income school. If the school at which the grant recipient is employed meets the requirements of a low-income school in the first year of <PRTPAGE P="354"/>the grant recipient's four elementary or secondary academic years of teaching and the school fails to meet those requirements in subsequent years, those subsequent years of teaching qualify for purposes of this section for that recipient.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) In addition to the documentation requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, the documentation must show that the grant recipient—</P>
              <P>(i) Taught a majority of classes during the period being certified in any of the high-need fields of mathematics, science, a foreign language, bilingual education, English language acquisition, special education, or as a reading specialist; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Taught a majority of classes during the period being certified in a State in another high-need field designated by that State and listed in the Nationwide List, except that teaching service does not satisfy the requirements of the agreement to serve if that teaching service is in a geographic region of a State or in a specific grade level not associated with a high-need field of a State designated in the Nationwide List as having a shortage of elementary or secondary school teachers.</P>
              <P>(2) If a grant recipient begins qualified full-time teaching service in a State in a high-need field designated by that State and listed in the Nationwide List and in subsequent years that high-need field is no longer designated by the State in the Nationwide List, the grant recipient will be considered to continue to perform qualified full-time teaching service in a high-need field of that State and to continue to fulfill the service obligation.</P>
              <P>(d) Documentation must also provide evidence that the grant recipient is a highly-qualified teacher.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Enrollment status for students taking regular and correspondence courses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If, in addition to regular coursework, a student takes correspondence courses from either his or her own institution or another institution having an agreement for this purpose with the student's institution, the correspondence work may be included in determining the student's enrollment status to the extent permitted under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as noted in paragraph (c) of this section, the correspondence work that may be included in determining a student's enrollment status is that amount of work which—</P>
              <P>(1) Applies toward a student's degree or certificate or is remedial work taken by the student to help in his or her course of study;</P>
              <P>(2) Is completed within the period of time required for regular course work; and</P>
              <P>(3) Does not exceed the amount of a student's regular course work for the payment period for which the student's enrollment status is being calculated.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Notwithstanding the limitation in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a student who would be a half-time student based solely on his or her correspondence work is considered a half-time student unless the calculation in paragraph (b) of this section produces an enrollment status greater than half-time.</P>
              <P>(2) A student who would be a less-than-half-time student based solely on his or her correspondence work or a combination of correspondence work and regular course work is considered a less-than-half-time student.</P>
              <P>(d) The following chart provides examples of the rules set forth in this section. It assumes that the institution defines full-time enrollment as 12 credits per term, making the half-time enrollment equal to 6 credits per term.</P>

              <P>(1) Qualifies as an eligible student under 34 CFR Part 668, Subpart C;</P>
              <P>(2) Is enrolled in an eligible program as an undergraduate student; and</P>
              <P>(3) If enrolled in a credit hour program without terms or a clock hour program, has completed the payment period as defined in § 668.4 for which he or she has been paid a Federal Pell Grant.</P>
              <P>(b) If an institution determines at the beginning of a payment period that a student is not maintaining satisfactory progress, but reverses that determination before the end of the payment period, the institution may pay a Federal Pell Grant to the student for the entire payment period.</P>
              <P>(c) If an institution determines at the beginning of a payment period that a student is not maintaining satisfactory progress, but reverses that determination after the end of the payment period, the institution may neither pay the student a Federal Pell Grant for that payment period nor make adjustments in subsequent Federal Pell Grant payments to compensate for the loss of aid for that period.</P>
              <P>(d) A member of a religious order, community, society, agency of or organization who is pursuing a course of study in an institution of higher education is considered to have an expected family contribution amount at least equal to the maximum authorized award amount for the award year if that religious order—</P>
              <P>(1) Has as a primary objective the promotion of ideals and beliefs regarding a Supreme Being; and</P>
              <P>(2) Provides subsistence support to its members, or has directed the member to pursue the course of study.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, a student is liable for any Federal Pell Grant overpayment made to him or her.</P>
              <P>(2) The institution is liable for a Federal Pell Grant overpayment if the overpayment occurred because the institution failed to follow the procedures set forth in this part or 34 CFR Part 668. The institution must restore an amount equal to the overpayment to its Federal Pell Grant account.</P>
              <P>(3) A student is not liable for, and the institution is not required to attempt recovery of or refer to the Secretary, a Federal Pell Grant overpayment if the amount of the overpayment is less than $25 and is not a remaining balance.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if an institution makes a Federal Pell Grant overpayment for which it is not liable, it must promptly send a written notice <PRTPAGE P="369"/>to the student requesting repayment of the overpayment amount. The notice must state that failure to make that repayment, or to make arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to repay the overpayment, makes the student ineligible for further title IV, HEA program funds until final resolution of the Federal Pell Grant overpayment.</P>
              <P>(2) If a student objects to the institution's Federal Pell Grant overpayment determination on the grounds that it is erroneous, the institution must consider any information provided by the student and determine whether the objection is warranted.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if the student fails to repay a Federal Pell Grant overpayment or make arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to repay the Federal Pell Grant overpayment, after the institution has taken the action required by paragraph (b) of this section, the institution must refer the overpayment to the Secretary for collection purposes in accordance with procedures required by the Secretary. After referring the Federal Pell Grant overpayment to the Secretary under this section, the institution need make no further efforts to recover the overpayment.</P>

              <P>(i) The correction of a clerical or arithmetic error under § 690.14; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A correction based on information required as a result of verification under 34 CFR part 668, subpart E.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as described in 34 CFR 668.60(c), the institution shall adjust the student's award when an overaward or underaward is caused by the change in the expected family contribution. That adjustment must be made—</P>
              <P>(i) Within the same award year—if possible—to correct any overpayment or underpayment; or</P>
              <P>(ii) During the next award year to correct any overpayment that could not be adjusted during the year in which the student was overpaid.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Change in enrollment status.</E> (1) If the student's enrollment status changes from one academic term to another term within the same award year, the institution shall recalculate the Federal Pell Grant award for the new payment period taking into account any changes in the cost of attendance.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) If the student's projected enrollment status changes during a payment period after the student has begun attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, the institution may (but is not required to) establish a policy under which the student's award for the payment period is recalculated. Any such recalculations must take into account any changes in the cost of attendance. If such a policy is established, it must apply to all students.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a student's projected enrollment status changes during a payment period before the student begins attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, the institution shall recalculate the student's enrollment status to reflect only those classes for which the student actually began attendance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Change in cost of attendance.</E> If the student's cost of attendance changes at any time during the award year and his or her enrollment status remains the same, the institution may (but is not required to) establish a policy under which the student's award for the payment period is recalculated. If such a policy is established, it must apply to all students.</P>

              <P>(i) The institution submits to the Secretary the student's Payment Data for that award year in the manner and form prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section by September 30 following the end of the award year in which the grant is made, or, if September 30 falls on a weekend, on the first weekday following September 30; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary accepts the student's Payment Data.</P>

              <P>(2) The Secretary accepts a student's Payment Data that is submitted in accordance with procedures established through publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and that contains information the Secretary considers to be accurate in light of other available information including that previously provided by the student and the institution.</P>
              <P>(3) An institution that does not comply with the requirements of this paragraph may receive a payment or reduction in accountability only as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) An institution shall report to the Secretary any change in the amount of a grant for which a student qualifies including any related Payment Data changes by submitting to the Secretary the student's Payment Data that discloses the basis and result of the change in award for each student. The institution shall submit the student's Payment Data reporting any change to the Secretary by the reporting deadlines published by the Secretary in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(2) An institution shall submit, in accordance with deadline dates established by the Secretary, through publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> other reports and information the Secretary requires and shall comply with the procedures the Secretary finds necessary to ensure that the reports are correct.</P>
              <P>(3) An institution that timely submits, and has accepted by the Secretary, the Payment Data for a student in accordance with this section shall report a reduction in the amount of a Federal Pell Grant award that the student received when it determines that an overpayment has occurred, unless that overpayment is one for which the institution is not liable under § 690.79(a).</P>
              <P>(c) In accordance with 34 CFR 668.84, the Secretary may impose a fine on the institution if the institution fails to comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, if an institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the institution has provided Federal Pell Grants in accordance with this part but has not received credit or payment for those grants, the institution may receive payment or a reduction in accountability for those grants in accordance with paragraphs (d)(4) and either (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) The institution must demonstrate that it qualifies for a credit or payment by means of a finding contained in an audit report of an award year that was the first audit of that award <PRTPAGE P="371"/>year and that was conducted after December 31, 1988 and timely submitted to the Secretary under 34 CFR 668.23(c).</P>
              <P>(3) An institution that timely submits the Payment Data for a student in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section but does not timely submit to the Secretary, or have accepted by the Secretary, the Payment Data necessary to document the full amount of the award to which the student is entitled, may receive a payment or reduction in accountability in the full amount of that award, if—</P>

              <P>(ii) The institution seeks an adjustment to reflect an underpayment for that award that is at least $100.</P>
              <P>(4) In determining whether the institution qualifies for a payment or reduction in accountability, the Secretary takes into account any liabilities of the institution arising from that audit or program review or any other source.

              <P>(4) For a student who transfers from an eligible program at one institution to an eligible program at another institution, the institution to which the student transfers may rely upon the prior institution's determination that the student successfully completed a rigorous secondary school program of study in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A), (b)(1)(ii)(B), (b)(1)(iii)(A), and (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section based on documentation that the prior institution may provide, or based on documentation of the receipt of an ACG disbursement at the prior institution.</P>

              <P>(5)(i) If a student self-certifies on an application under § 691.12, or otherwise self-identifies to the institution, that he or she completed a rigorous secondary school program of study under § 691.16, an institution must attempt to <PRTPAGE P="377"/>collect the documentation described under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iii) Is at an institution that offers as an eligible major a qualifying liberal arts curriculum identified under § 691.17(b); and</P>
              <P>(3) Has a cumulative GPA through the most recently completed payment period of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale, or the numeric equivalent measure, consistent with other institutional measures for academic and title IV, HEA program purposes, in the student's eligible program.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Intent to declare a major.</E> (1) For a student whose institution's academic policies do not allow the student to declare an eligible major in time to qualify for a National SMART Grant disbursement, the institution must obtain and keep on file a recent self-certification of intent to declare an eligible major that is signed by the student.</P>
              <P>(2) The student described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section must formally declare an eligible major when he or she is able to do so under the institution's academic requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) If the student is enrolled in a qualifying liberal arts curriculum as a major, there is no requirement to declare a major.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Documentation of progression in the major.</E> The institution must document a student's progress in taking the courses necessary to complete the program in the intended or declared major that establishes eligibility for a National SMART Grant. Documentation of coursework progression in the eligible program may include, but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Written counselor or advisor tracking of coursework progress toward a degree in the intended or declared eligible major.</P>
              <P>(2) Written confirmation from an academic department within the institution that the student is progressing in coursework leading to a degree in the intended or declared eligible major. This confirmation must be signed by a departmental representative for the intended eligible major.</P>
              <P>(3) Other written documentation of coursework that satisfies the ongoing nature of monitoring student coursework progression in the intended or declared eligible major.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Transfer students.</E> (1)(i) Under the ACG Program, if a student transfers to an institution that accepts for enrollment at least the credit or clock hours to be considered a second-year student from all prior postsecondary institutions attended by the student, the GPA to determine second-year eligibility for an ACG is calculated using the grades from all coursework accepted by the current institution into the student's eligible program.</P>
              <P>(ii) Under the ACG Program, if a student transfers to an institution that accepts for enrollment less than the credit or clock hours to be considered a second-year student from all prior postsecondary institutions attended by the student, the GPA to determine second-year eligibility for an ACG is calculated using the grades from—</P>
              <P>(A) All coursework accepted from all prior postsecondary institutions by the current institution into the student's eligible program; and</P>

              <P>(B) The coursework earned at the current institution through the payment period in which the student completes the credit or clock hours of the student's first year in an eligible program based on the total of the credit or clock hours accepted on transfer and <PRTPAGE P="378"/>the credit or clock hours earned at the current institution.</P>
              <P>(2) Under the National SMART Grant Program, if a student transfers from one institution to the current institution, the current institution must determine that student's eligibility for a National SMART Grant for the first payment period using either the method described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section or the method described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, whichever method coincides with the current institution's academic policy. For an eligible student who transfers to an institution that—</P>
              <P>(i) Does not incorporate grades from coursework that it accepts on transfer into the student's GPA at the current institution, the current institution, for the courses accepted in the eligible program upon transfer—</P>
              <P>(A) Must calculate the student's GPA for the first payment period of enrollment using the grades earned by the student in the coursework from any prior postsecondary institution that it accepts toward the student's eligible program; and</P>
              <P>(B) Must, for all subsequent payment periods, apply its academic policy and not incorporate the grades from the coursework that it accepts on transfer into the GPA at the current institution; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Incorporates grades from the coursework that it accepts on transfer into the student's GPA at the current institution, an institution must use the grades assigned to the coursework accepted by the current institution into the eligible program as the student's cumulative GPA to determine eligibility for the first payment period of enrollment and all subsequent payment periods in accordance with its academic policy.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Numeric equivalent.</E> (1) If an otherwise eligible program measures academic performance using an alternative to standard numeric grading procedures, the institution must develop and apply an equivalency policy with a numeric scale for purposes of establishing ACG or National SMART Grant eligibility. That institution's equivalency policy must be in writing and available to students upon request and must include clear differentiations of student performance to support a determination that a student has performed at a level commensurate with at least a 3.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale in that program.</P>
              <P>(2) A grading policy that includes only “satisfactory/unsatisfactory”, “pass/fail”, or other similar nonnumeric assessments qualifies as a numeric equivalent only if—</P>
              <P>(i) The institution demonstrates that the “pass” or “satisfactory” standard has the numeric equivalent of at least a 3.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale awarded in that program, or that a student's performance for tests and assignments yielded a numeric equivalent of a 3.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The institution's equivalency policy is consistent with any other standards the institution may have developed for academic and other title IV, HEA program purposes, such as graduate school applications, scholarship eligibility, and insurance certifications, to the extent such standards distinguish among various levels of a student's academic performance.</P>

              <P>(2) The institution is liable for a grant overpayment if the overpayment occurred because the institution failed to follow the procedures set forth in this part or 34 CFR part 668. The institution must restore an amount equal to the overpayment to its ACG or National SMART Grant account, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(3) A student is not liable for, and the institution is not required to attempt recovery of or refer to the Secretary, a grant overpayment under this part if the amount of the overpayment is less than $25 and is not a remaining balance.</P>

The notice must state that failure to make that repayment, or to make arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to repay the overpayment, makes the student ineligible for further title IV, HEA program funds until final resolution of the overpayment.</P>
              <P>(2) If a student objects to the institution's overpayment determination on the grounds that it is erroneous, the institution must consider any information provided by the student and determine whether the objection is warranted.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if the student fails to repay an overpayment under this part or make arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to repay the overpayment, after the institution has taken the action required by paragraph (b) of this section, the institution must refer the overpayment to the Secretary for collection purposes in accordance with procedures required by the Secretary. After referring the overpayment to the Secretary under this section, the institution need make no further efforts to recover the overpayment.</P>

If such a policy is established, it must apply to all students and be the same as the policy established for the Federal Pell Grant Program.</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) If a student's projected enrollment status changes during a payment period before the student begins attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, the institution must recalculate the student's enrollment status to reflect only those classes for which the student actually began attendance.</P>
              <P>(B) If a student's projected enrollment status changes to less-than-half-time during a payment period before the student begins attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, the institution must determine that the student is ineligible for a grant for that payment period.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) An institution may receive either a payment from the Secretary for an award to an ACG or a National SMART Grant recipient, or a corresponding reduction in the amount of Federal funds received in advance for which it is accountable, if—</P>
              <P>(i) The institution submits to the Secretary the student's Payment Data for that award year in the manner and form prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section by September 30 following the end of the award year in which the grant is made, or, if September 30 falls on a weekend, on the first weekday following September 30; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary accepts the student's Payment Data.</P>

              <P>(2) The Secretary accepts a student's Payment Data that is submitted in accordance with procedures established through publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and that contains information the Secretary considers to be accurate in light of other available information including that previously provided by the student and the institution.</P>
              <P>(3) An institution that does not comply with the requirements of this paragraph may receive a payment or reduction in accountability only as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) An institution shall report to the Secretary any change in the amount of a grant for which a student qualifies including any related Payment Data changes by submitting to the Secretary the student's Payment Data that discloses the basis and result of the change in award for each student. The institution shall submit the student's Payment Data reporting any change to the Secretary by the reporting deadlines published by the Secretary in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(2) An institution shall submit, in accordance with deadline dates established by the Secretary, through publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> other reports and information the Secretary requires and shall comply with the procedures the Secretary finds necessary to ensure that the reports are correct.</P>
              <P>(3) An institution that timely submits, and has accepted by the Secretary, the Payment Data for a student in accordance with this section shall report a reduction in the amount of an award that the student received when it determines that an overpayment has occurred, unless that overpayment is one for which the institution is not liable under § 691.79(a).</P>
              <P>(c) In accordance with 34 CFR 668.84, the Secretary may impose a fine on the institution if the institution fails to comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, if an institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the institution has provided ACGs or National SMART Grants in accordance with this part but has not received credit or payment for those grants, the institution may receive payment or a reduction in accountability for those grants in accordance with paragraphs (d)(4) and either (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The institution must demonstrate that it qualifies for a credit or payment by means of a finding contained in an audit report of an award year that was the first audit of that award year and timely submitted to the Secretary under 34 CFR 668.23(a).</P>

              <P>(3) An institution that timely submits the Payment Data for a student <PRTPAGE P="390"/>in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section but does not timely submit to the Secretary, or have accepted by the Secretary, the Payment Data necessary to document the full amount of the award to which the student is entitled, may receive a payment or reduction in accountability in the full amount of that award, if—</P>
              <P>(i) A program review demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the student was eligible to receive an amount greater than that reported in the student's Payment Data timely submitted to, and accepted by the Secretary; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The institution seeks an adjustment to reflect an underpayment for that award that is at least $100.</P>
              <P>(4) In determining whether the institution qualifies for a payment or reduction in accountability, the Secretary takes into account any liabilities of the institution arising from that audit or program review or any other source. The Secretary collects those liabilities by offset in accordance with 34 CFR part 30.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How does the Secretary allot funds to the States?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a)(1) The Secretary allots to each State participating in the LEAP program an amount which bears the same ratio to the Federal LEAP funds appropriated as the number of students in that State who are “deemed eligible” to participate in the State's LEAP program bears to the total number of students in all States who are “deemed eligible” to participate in the LEAP program, except that no State may receive less than it received in fiscal year 1979 for the programs under this part.</P>
                <P>(2) For the programs under this part, if the Federal funds appropriated for a fiscal year are not sufficient to allot to each State the amount of Federal funds it received in fiscal year 1979, the Secretary allots to each State an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of Federal funds appropriated as the amount of Federal funds that State received in fiscal year 1979 bears to the amount of Federal funds all States received in fiscal year 1979.</P>
                <P>(b) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary determines the number of students “deemed eligible” to participate in a State's LEAP Program by dividing the amount of that State's LEAP expenditures, including both its Federal allotment and the State funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per student of all participating States. The Secretary determines the “average grant award per student” by dividing the total number of student recipients for all States into the total amount of LEAP expenditures for all States, including both the Federal allotments and the State funds matching those allotments. In making this determination, the Secretary uses the most current available data reported by each State.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What standards may a State use to determine substantial financial need?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A State determines whether a student has substantial financial need on the basis of criteria it establishes that are approved by the Secretary. A State may define substantial financial need in terms of family income, expected family contribution, and relative need as measured by the difference between the student's cost of attendance and the resources available to meet that cost. To determine substantial need, the State may use—</P>
                <P>(1) A system for determining a student's financial need under part F of title IV of the HEA;</P>
                <P>(2) The State's own needs analysis system if approved by the Secretary; or</P>
                <P>(3) A combination of these systems, if approved by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(b) The Secretary generally approves a need-analysis system under paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section only if the need-analysis system applies the term “independent student” as defined under section 480(d) of the HEA. However, for good cause shown, the Secretary may approve, on a case-by-case basis, a State's need analysis system that uses a definition for “independent student” that varies from that term as defined in section 480(d) of the HEA.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Under what conditions may the Secretary approve a request from a Partnership applying for a GEAR UP grant to waive a portion of the matching requirement?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Secretary may approve a Partnership applicant's request for a waiver of up to 75 percent of the matching requirement for up to two years if the applicant demonstrates in its application a significant economic hardship that stems from a specific, exceptional, or uncontrollable event, such as a natural disaster, that has a devastating effect on the members of the Partnership and the community in which the project would operate.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The Secretary may approve a Partnership applicant's request to waive up to 50 percent of the matching requirement for up to two years if the applicant demonstrates in its application a pre-existing and an on-going significant economic hardship that precludes the applicant from meeting its matching requirement.</P>
            <P>(2) In determining whether an applicant is experiencing an on-going economic hardship that is significant enough to justify a waiver under this paragraph, the Secretary considers documentation of such factors as:</P>

            <P>(i) Severe distress in the local economy of the community to be served by the grant (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> there are few employers in the local area, large employers have left the local area, or significant reductions in employment in the local area).</P>
            <P>(ii) Local unemployment rates that are higher than the national average.</P>
            <P>(iii) Low or decreasing revenues for State and County governments in the area to be served by the grant.</P>
            <P>(iv) Significant reductions in the budgets of institutions of higher education that are participating in the grant.</P>
            <P>(v) Other data that reflect a significant economic hardship for the geographical area served by the applicant.</P>
            <P>(3) At the time of application, the Secretary may provide tentative approval of an applicant's request for a waiver under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for all remaining years of the project period. Grantees that receive tentative approval of a waiver for more than two years under this paragraph must submit to the Secretary every two years by such time as the Secretary may direct documentation that demonstrates that—</P>
            <P>(i) The significant economic hardship upon which the waiver was granted still exists; and</P>

            <P>(ii) The grantee tried diligently, but unsuccessfully, to obtain contributions <PRTPAGE P="419"/>needed to meet the matching requirement.</P>
            <P>(c) The Secretary may approve a Partnership applicant's request in its application to match its contributions to its scholarship fund, established under section 404E of the HEA, on the basis of two non-Federal dollars for every one Federal dollar of GEAR UP funds.</P>
            <P>(d) The Secretary may approve a request by a Partnership applicant that has three or fewer institutions of higher education as members to waive up to 70 percent of the matching requirement if the Partnership applicant includes—</P>
            <P>(1) A fiscal agent that is eligible to receive funds under title V, or Part B of title III, or section 316 or 317 of the HEA, or a local educational agency;</P>
            <P>(2) Only participating schools with a 7th grade cohort in which at least 75 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act; and</P>
            <P>(3) Only local educational agencies in which at least 50 percent of the students enrolled are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act.</P>

            <P>(1) 50 percent of the matching requirement for up to two years if the grantee demonstrates that—</P>
            <P>(i) The matching contributions described for those two years in the grantee's approved application are no longer available; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The grantee has exhausted all funds and sources of potential contributions for replacing the matching funds.</P>
            <P>(2) 75 percent of the matching requirement for up to two years if the grantee demonstrates that matching contributions from the original application are no longer available due to an uncontrollable event, such as a natural disaster, that has a devastating economic effect on members of the Partnership and the community in which the project would operate.</P>
            <P>(b) In determining whether the grantee has exhausted all funds and sources of potential contributions for replacing matching funds, the Secretary considers the grantee's documentation of key factors such as the following and their direct impact on the grantee:</P>
            <P>(1) A reduction of revenues from State government, County government, or the local educational agency (LEA).</P>
            <P>(2) An increase in local unemployment rates.</P>
            <P>(3) Significant reductions in the operating budgets of institutions of higher education that are participating in the grant.</P>

            <P>(4) A reduction of business activity in the local area (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> large employers have left the local area).</P>
            <P>(5) Other data that reflect a significant decrease in resources available to the grantee in the local geographical area served by the grantee.</P>
            <P>(c) If a grantee has received one or more waivers under this section or under § 694.8, the grantee may request an additional waiver of the matching requirement under this section no earlier than 60 days before the expiration of the grantee's existing waiver.</P>
            <P>(d) The Secretary may grant an additional waiver request for up to 50 percent of the matching requirement for a period of up to two years beyond the expiration of any previous waiver.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
            <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1200.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, <PRTPAGE P="437"/>shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1200.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1200.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
            <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
            <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by January 24, 1994, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by November 26, 1996, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by May 26, 1994, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
            <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
            <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
            <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

            <P>Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

            <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
            <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
            <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
            <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>

            <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices <PRTPAGE P="438"/>for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>
            <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
            <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
            <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1200.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
