      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Is the Secretary's decision not to make an award under the Native American Career and Technical Education Program subject to a hearing?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) After receiving written notice from an authorized official of the Department that the Secretary will not award a grant or cooperative agreement to an eligible applicant, an Indian tribal organization has 30 calendar days to make a written request to the Secretary for a hearing to review the Secretary's decision.</P>
              <P>(b) Within 10 business days of the Department's receipt of a hearing request, the Secretary designates a Department employee who is not assigned to the Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education to serve as a hearing officer. The hearing officer conducts a hearing and issues a written decision within 75 calendar days of the Department's receipt of the hearing request. The hearing officer establishes rules for the conduct of the hearing.

These protocols include, for example, the use of parallel, equated forms, testing conditions, time allowed for the test, standardized scoring, and the amount of instructional time a student needs before post-testing. Violation of these protocols often invalidates the test scores. Tests are not limited to traditional paper and pencil (or computer-administered) instruments for which forms are constructed prior to administration to examinees. Tests may also include adaptive tests that use computerized algorithms for selecting and administering items in real time; however, for such instruments, the size of the item pool and the method of item selection must ensure negligible overlap in items across pre- and post-testing.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Review.</E> (1) When the Secretary receives a complete application from a test publisher, the Secretary selects experts in the field of educational testing and assessment who possess appropriate advanced degrees and experience in test development or psychometric research, or both, to advise the Secretary on the extent to which a test meets the criteria and requirements in § 462.13.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary reviews and determines the suitability of a test only if an application—</P>
              <P>(i) Is submitted by a test publisher;</P>
              <P>(ii) Meets the deadline established by the Secretary;</P>
              <P>(iii) Includes a test that—</P>
              <P>(A) Has two or more secure, parallel, equated forms of the same test—either traditional paper and pencil or computer-administered instruments—for which forms are constructed prior to administration to examinees; or</P>
              <P>(B) Is an adaptive test that uses computerized algorithms for selecting and administering items in real time; however, for such an instrument, the size of the item pool and the method of item selection must ensure negligible overlap in items across pre- and post-testing;</P>
              <P>(iv) Includes a test that samples one or more of the major content domains of the NRS educational functioning levels of ABE, ASE or ESL with sufficient numbers of questions to represent adequately the domain or domains; and</P>
              <P>(v) Includes the information prescribed by the Secretary, including the information in § 462.11 of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Secretary's determination.</E> (1) The Secretary determines whether a test meets the criteria and requirements in § 462.13 after taking into account the advice of the experts described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) For tests that contain multiple sub-tests measuring content domains <PRTPAGE P="13"/>other than those of the NRS educational functioning levels, the Secretary determines the suitability of only those sub-tests covering the domains of the NRS educational functioning levels.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Suitable tests.</E> If the Secretary determines that a test satisfies the criteria and requirements in § 462.13 and, therefore, is suitable for use in the NRS, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(1) Notifies the test publisher of the Secretary's decision; and</P>
              <P>(2) Annually publishes in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and posts on the Internet at <E T="03">www.nrsweb.org</E> a list of the names of tests and test forms and the educational functioning levels the tests are suitable to measure in the NRS.

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Unsuitable tests.</E> (1) If the Secretary determines that a test does not satisfy the criteria and requirements in § 462.13 and, therefore, is not suitable for use in the NRS, the Secretary notifies the test publisher of the Secretary's decision and of the reasons why the test does not meet those criteria and requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) The test publisher may resubmit an application to have the suitability of its test determined by the Secretary under this part on October 1 in the year immediately following the year in which the Secretary notifies the publisher.</P>
              <P>(i) An analysis of why the information and documentation submitted meet the criteria and requirements in § 462.13, notwithstanding the Secretary's earlier decision to the contrary; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Any additional documentation and information that address the Secretary's reasons for determining that the test was unsuitable.</P>
              <P>(3) The Secretary reviews the additional information submitted by the test publisher and makes a final determination regarding the suitability of the test for use in the NRS.</P>
              <P>(i) If the Secretary's decision is unchanged and the test remains unsuitable for use in the NRS, the Secretary notifies the test publisher, and this action concludes the review process.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the Secretary's decision changes and the test is determined to be suitable for use in the NRS, the Secretary follows the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Revocation.</E> (1) The Secretary's determination regarding the suitability of a test may be revoked if the Secretary determines that—</P>
              <P>(i) The information the publisher submitted as a basis for the Secretary's review of the test was inaccurate; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A test has been substantially revised—for example, by changing its mode of administration, administration procedures, structure, number of items, content specifications, item types, forms or sub-tests, or number of hours between pre- and post-testing.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary notifies the test publisher of the—</P>
              <P>(i) Secretary's decision to revoke the determination that the test is suitable for use in the NRS; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Reasons for the Secretary's revocation.</P>
              <P>(3) Within 30 days after the Secretary notifies a test publisher of the decision to revoke a determination that a test is suitable for use in the NRS, the test publisher may request that the Secretary reconsider the decision. This request must be accompanied by documentation and information that address the Secretary's reasons for revoking the determination that the test is suitable for use in the NRS.</P>
              <P>(4) The Secretary reviews the information submitted by the test publisher and makes a final determination regarding the suitability of the test for use in the NRS.</P>

              <P>(5) If the Secretary revokes the determination regarding the suitability of a test, the Secretary publishes in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and posts on the Internet at <E T="03">www.nrsweb.org</E> a notice of that revocation along with the date by which States and eligible providers must stop using the revoked test.

              </P>

              <P>(2) If requested by the Secretary, a test publisher must explain why it believes that certain standards in the 1999 edition of the <E T="03">Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing</E> were not applicable or were not feasible to meet.</P>
              <P>(d) The test must contain the publisher's guidelines for retesting, including time between test-taking, which are accompanied by appropriate justification.</P>
              <P>(e) The test must—</P>
              <P>(1) Have two or more secure, parallel, equated forms of the same test—either traditional paper and pencil or computer administered instruments—for which forms are constructed prior to administration to examinees; or</P>
              <P>(2) Be an adaptive test that uses computerized algorithms for selecting and administering items in real time; however, for such an instrument, the size of the item pool and the method of item selection must ensure negligible overlap in items across pre- and post-testing. Scores associated with these alternate administrations must be equivalent in meaning.</P>
              <P>(f) For a test that has been modified for individuals with disabilities, the test publisher must—</P>

              <P>(1) Provide documentation that it followed the guidelines provided in the Testing Individuals With Disabilities section of the 1999 edition of the <E T="03">Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing;</E>

              <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for modifications of the Combined State Plan?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For the core program portions of the Combined State Plan, modifications are required, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(1) By the end of the first 2-year period of any 4-year State Plan. The State WDB must review the Combined State Plan, and the Governor must submit modifications to the Combined State Plan to reflect changes in labor market and economic conditions or other factors affecting the implementation of the Combined State Plan;</P>
              <P>(2) When changes in Federal or State law or policy substantially affect the strategies, goals, and priorities upon which the Combined State Plan is based;</P>
              <P>(3) When there are changes in the statewide vision, strategies, policies, State negotiated levels of performance as described in § 463.170(b), the methodology used to determine local allocation of funds, reorganizations that change the working relationship with system employees, changes in organizational responsibilities, changes to the membership structure of the State WDB or alternative entity, and similar substantial changes to the State's workforce development system.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the required modification review described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a State may submit a modification of its Combined State Plan at any time during the 4-year period of the plan.</P>
              <P>(c) For any Combined State Plan partner programs and activities described in § 463.140(d) that are included in a State's Combined State Plan, the State—</P>
              <P>(1) May decide if the modification requirements under WIOA sec. 102(c)(3) that apply to the core programs will apply to the Combined State Plan partner programs, as long as consistent with any other modification requirements for the programs, or may comply with the requirements applicable to only the particular program or activity; and</P>

              <P>(2) Must submit, in accordance with the procedure described in § 463.143, any modification, amendment, or revision required by the Federal law authorizing, or applicable to, the Combined <PRTPAGE P="36"/>State Plan partner program or activity.</P>

              <P>(i) If the underlying programmatic requirements change (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the authorizing statute is reauthorized) for Federal laws authorizing such programs, a State must either modify its Combined State Plan or submit a separate plan to the appropriate Federal agency in accordance with the new Federal law authorizing the Combined State Plan partner program or activity and other legal requirements applicable to such program or activity.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the modification, amendment, or revision affects the administration of only that particular Combined State Plan partner program and has no impact on the Combined State Plan as a whole or the integration and administration of the core and other Combined State Plan partner programs at the State level, modifications must be submitted for approval to only the appropriate Secretary, based on the approval standards applicable to the original Combined State Plan under § 463.143, if the State elects, or in accordance with the procedures and requirements applicable to the particular Combined State Plan partner program.</P>
              <P>(3) A State also may amend its Combined State Plan to add a Combined State Plan partner program or activity described in § 463.140(d).</P>
              <P>(d) Modifications of the Combined State Plan are subject to the same public review and comment requirements that apply to the development of the original Combined State Plan as described in § 463.143(c) except that, if the modification, amendment, or revision affects the administration of a particular Combined State Plan partner program and has no impact on the Combined State Plan as a whole or the integration and administration of the core and other Combined State Plan partner programs at the State level, a State may comply instead with the procedures and requirements applicable to the particular Combined State Plan partner program.</P>
              <P>(e) Modifications for the core program portions of the Combined State Plan must be approved by the Secretaries of Labor and Education, based on the approval standards applicable to the original Combined State Plan under § 463.143. This approval must come after the approval of the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration for modification of any portion of the Combined State Plan described in sec. 102(b)(2)(D)(iii) of WIOA.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Participant.</E> A reportable individual who has received services other than the services described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, after satisfying all applicable programmatic requirements for the provision of services, such as eligibility determination.</P>
              <P>(1) For the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program, a participant is a reportable individual who has an approved and signed Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) and has begun to receive services.</P>
              <P>(2) For the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) title I youth program, a participant is a reportable individual who has satisfied all applicable program requirements for the provision of services, including eligibility determination, an objective assessment, and development of an individual service strategy, and received 1 of the 14 WIOA youth program elements identified in sec. 129(c)(2) of WIOA.</P>
              <P>(3) The following individuals are not participants:</P>
              <P>(i) Individuals in an Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) program who have not completed at least 12 contact hours;</P>
              <P>(ii) Individuals who only use the self-service system.</P>

              <P>(A) Subject to paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, self-service occurs when individuals independently access any <PRTPAGE P="37"/>workforce development system program's information and activities in either a physical location, such as a one-stop center resource room or partner agency, or remotely via the use of electronic technologies.</P>
              <P>(B) Self-service does not uniformly apply to all virtually accessed services. For example, virtually accessed services that provide a level of support beyond independent job or information seeking on the part of an individual would not qualify as self-service.</P>
              <P>(iii) Individuals who receive information-only services or activities, which provide readily available information that does not require an assessment by a staff member of the individual's skills, education, or career objectives.</P>

              <P>(2) Individuals who only use the self-service system; or</P>
              <P>(3) Individuals who only receive information-only services or activities.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exit.</E> As defined for the purpose of performance calculations, exit is the point after which a participant who has received services through any program meets the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) For the adult, dislocated worker, and youth programs authorized under WIOA title I, the AEFLA program authorized under WIOA title II, and the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III, exit date is the last date of service.</P>
              <P>(i) The last day of service cannot be determined until at least 90 days have elapsed since the participant last received services; services do not include self-service, information-only services or activities, or follow-up services. This also requires that there are no plans to provide the participant with future services.</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved].</P>
              <P>(2)(i) For the VR program authorized under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by WIOA title IV (VR program):</P>
              <P>(A) The participant's record of service is closed in accordance with § 463.56 because the participant has achieved an employment outcome; or</P>
              <P>(B) The participant's service record is closed because the individual has not achieved an employment outcome or the individual has been determined ineligible after receiving services in accordance with § 463.43.</P>
              <P>(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a participant will not be considered as meeting the definition of exit from the VR program if the participant's service record is closed because the participant has achieved a supported employment outcome in an integrated setting but not in competitive integrated employment.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) A State may implement a common exit policy for all or some of the core programs in WIOA title I and the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III, and any additional required partner program(s) listed in sec. 121(b)(1)(B) of WIOA that is under the authority of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).</P>
              <P>(ii) If a State chooses to implement a common exit policy, the policy must require that a participant is exited only when all of the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are met for the WIOA title I core programs and the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III, as well as any additional required partner programs listed in sec. 121(b)(1)(B) of WIOA under the authority of DOL to which the common exit policy applies in which the participant is enrolled.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When are sanctions applied for failure to achieve adjusted levels of performance?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) States' negotiated levels of performance will be adjusted through the application of the statistical adjustment model established under § 463.170 to account for actual economic conditions experienced during a program year and characteristics of participants, annually at the close of each program year.</P>
              <P>(b) Any State that fails to meet adjusted levels of performance for the primary indicators of performance outlined in § 463.155 for any year will receive technical assistance, including assistance in the development of a performance improvement plan provided by the Secretary of Labor or Secretary of Education.</P>
              <P>(c) Whether a State has failed to meet adjusted levels of performance will be determined using the following three criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) The overall State program score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved by a core program on the primary indicators of performance to the adjusted levels of performance for that core program. The average of the percentages achieved of the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators by a core program will constitute the overall State program score.</P>

              <P>(2) However, until all indicators for the core program have at least 2 years of complete data, the overall State program score will be based on a comparison of the actual results achieved to the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators that have at least 2 years of complete data for that program;<PRTPAGE P="43"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The overall State indicator score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved on a primary indicator of performance by all core programs in a State to the adjusted levels of performance for that primary indicator. The average of the percentages achieved of the adjusted level of performance by all of the core programs on that indicator will constitute the overall State indicator score.</P>
              <P>(4) However, until all indicators for the State have at least 2 years of complete data, the overall State indicator score will be based on a comparison of the actual results achieved to the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators that have at least 2 years of complete data in a State.</P>
              <P>(5) The individual indicator score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved by each core program on each of the individual primary indicators to the adjusted levels of performance for each of the program's primary indicators of performance.</P>
              <P>(d) A performance failure occurs when:</P>
              <P>(1) Any overall State program score or overall State indicator score falls below 90 percent for the program year; or</P>
              <P>(2) Any of the States' individual indicator scores fall below 50 percent for the program year.</P>
              <P>(e) Sanctions based on performance failure will be applied to States if, for 2 consecutive years, the State fails to meet:</P>
              <P>(1) 90 percent of the overall State program score for the same core program;</P>
              <P>(2) 90 percent of the overall State indicator score for the same primary indicator; or</P>

              <P>(1) The State fails to submit the State annual performance reports as required under WIOA sec. 116(d)(2), as defined in § 463.185;</P>
              <P>(2) The State fails to meet State adjusted levels of performance for the same primary performance indicator(s) under either § 463.190(d)(1) for the second consecutive year as defined in § 463.190; or</P>
              <P>(3) The State's score on the same indicator for the same program falls below 50 percent under § 463.190(d)(2) for the second consecutive year as defined in § 463.190.</P>
              <P>(b) If the State fails under paragraphs (a)(1) and either (a)(2) or (3) of this section in the same program year, the Secretaries of Labor and Education will reduce the Governor's Reserve Allotment by 10 percent of the maximum available amount for the immediately succeeding program year.</P>
              <P>(c) If a State's Governor's Reserve Allotment is reduced:</P>
              <P>(1) The reduced amount will not be returned to the State in the event that the State later improves performance or submits its annual performance report; and</P>
              <P>(2) The Governor's Reserve will continue to be set at the reduced level in each subsequent year until the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Education, depending on which program is impacted, determines that the State met the State adjusted levels of performance for the applicable primary performance indicators and has submitted all of the required performance reports.</P>
              <P>(d) A State may request review of a sanction the Secretary of Labor imposes in accordance with the provisions of 20 CFR 683.800.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the one-stop delivery system?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The one-stop delivery system brings together workforce development, educational, and other human resource services in a seamless customer-focused service delivery network that enhances access to the programs' services and improves long-term employment outcomes for individuals receiving assistance. One-stop partners administer separately funded programs as a set of integrated streamlined services to customers.</P>
              <P>(b) Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) assigns responsibilities at the local, State, and Federal level to ensure the creation and maintenance of a one-stop delivery system that enhances the range and quality of education and workforce development services that employers and individual customers can access.</P>
              <P>(c) The system must include at least one comprehensive physical center in each local area as described in § 463.305.</P>
              <P>(d) The system may also have additional arrangements to supplement the comprehensive center. These arrangements include:</P>

              <P>(1) An affiliated site or a network of affiliated sites, where one or more partners make programs, services, and activities available, as described in § 463.310;<PRTPAGE P="48"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) A network of eligible one-stop partners, as described in §§ 463.400 through 463.410, through which each partner provides one or more of the programs, services, and activities that are linked, physically or technologically, to an affiliated site or access point that assures customers are provided information on the availability of career services, as well as other program services and activities, regardless of where they initially enter the public workforce system in the local area; and</P>
              <P>(3) Specialized centers that address specific needs, including those of dislocated workers, youth, or key industry sectors, or clusters.</P>
              <P>(e) Required one-stop partner programs must provide access to programs, services, and activities through electronic means if applicable and practicable. This is in addition to providing access to services through the mandatory comprehensive physical one-stop center and any affiliated sites or specialized centers. The provision of programs and services by electronic methods such as Web sites, telephones, or other means must improve the efficiency, coordination, and quality of one-stop partner services. Electronic delivery must not replace access to such services at a comprehensive one-stop center or be a substitute to making services available at an affiliated site if the partner is participating in an affiliated site. Electronic delivery systems must be in compliance with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of WIOA sec. 188 and its implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 38.</P>
              <P>(f) The design of the local area's one-stop delivery system must be described in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) executed with the one-stop partners, described in § 463.500.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is a comprehensive one-stop center and what must be provided there?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A comprehensive one-stop center is a physical location where job seeker and employer customers can access the programs, services, and activities of all required one-stop partners. A comprehensive one-stop center must have at least one title I staff person physically present.</P>
              <P>(b) The comprehensive one-stop center must provide:</P>
              <P>(1) Career services, described in § 463.430;</P>
              <P>(2) Access to training services described in 20 CFR 680.200;</P>
              <P>(3) Access to any employment and training activities carried out under sec. 134(d) of WIOA;</P>
              <P>(4) Access to programs and activities carried out by one-stop partners listed in §§ 463.400 through 463.410, including the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III (Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service program); and</P>
              <P>(5) Workforce and labor market information.</P>
              <P>(c) Customers must have access to these programs, services, and activities during regular business days at a comprehensive one-stop center. The Local Workforce Development Board (WDB) may establish other service hours at other times to accommodate the schedules of individuals who work on regular business days. The State WDB will evaluate the hours of access to service as part of the evaluation of effectiveness in the one-stop certification process described in § 463.800(b).</P>
              <P>(d) “Access” to each partner program and its services means:</P>
              <P>(1) Having a program staff member physically present at the one-stop center;</P>
              <P>(2) Having a staff member from a different partner program physically present at the one-stop center appropriately trained to provide information to customers about the programs, services, and activities available through partner programs; or</P>
              <P>(3) Making available a direct linkage through technology to program staff who can provide meaningful information or services.</P>
              <P>(i) A “direct linkage” means providing direct connection at the one-stop center, within a reasonable time, by phone or through a real-time Web-based communication to a program staff member who can provide program information or services to the customer.</P>

              <P>(ii) A “direct linkage” cannot exclusively be providing a phone number or <PRTPAGE P="49"/>computer Web site or providing information, pamphlets, or materials.</P>
              <P>(e) All comprehensive one-stop centers must be physically and programmatically accessible to individuals with disabilities, as described in 29 CFR part 38, the implementing regulations of WIOA sec. 188.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 463.310</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What is an affiliated site and what must be provided there?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An affiliated site, or affiliate one-stop center, is a site that makes available to job seeker and employer customers one or more of the one-stop partners' programs, services, and activities. An affiliated site does not need to provide access to every required one-stop partner program. The frequency of program staff's physical presence in the affiliated site will be determined at the local level. Affiliated sites are access points in addition to the comprehensive one-stop center(s) in each local area. If used by local areas as a part of the service delivery strategy, affiliate sites must be implemented in a manner that supplements and enhances customer access to services.</P>
              <P>(b) As described in § 463.315, Wagner-Peyser Act employment services cannot be a stand-alone affiliated site.</P>
              <P>(c) States, in conjunction with the Local WDBs, must examine lease agreements and property holdings throughout the one-stop delivery system in order to use property in an efficient and effective way. Where necessary and appropriate, States and Local WDBs must take expeditious steps to align lease expiration dates with efforts to consolidate one-stop operations into service points where Wagner-Peyser Act employment services are colocated as soon as reasonably possible. These steps must be included in the State Plan.</P>
              <P>(d) All affiliated sites must be physically and programmatically accessible to individuals with disabilities, as described in 29 CFR part 38, the implementing regulations of WIOA sec. 188.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Can a stand-alone Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service office be designated as an affiliated one-stop site?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Separate stand-alone Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service offices are not permitted under WIOA, as also described in 20 CFR 652.202.</P>
              <P>(b) If Wagner-Peyser Act employment services are provided at an affiliated site, there must be at least one or more other partners in the affiliated site with a physical presence of combined staff more than 50 percent of the time the center is open. Additionally, the other partner must not be the partner administering local veterans' employment representatives, disabled veterans' outreach program specialists, or unemployment compensation programs. If Wagner-Peyser Act employment services and any of these 3 programs are provided at an affiliated site, an additional partner or partners must have a presence of combined staff in the center more than 50 percent of the time the center is open.</P>

              <P>Any network of one-stop partners or specialized centers, as described in § 463.300(d)(3), must be connected to the comprehensive one-stop center and any appropriate affiliate one-stop centers, for example, by having processes in place to make referrals to these centers and the partner programs located in them. Wagner-Peyser Act employment services cannot stand alone in a specialized center. Just as described in § 463.315 for an affiliated site, a specialized center must include other programs besides Wagner-Peyser Act employment services, local veterans' employment representatives, disabled veterans' outreach program specialists, and unemployment compensation.</P>

              <P>(i) A reasonable cost allocation methodology by which infrastructure costs are charged to each partner based on proportionate use and relative benefit received;<PRTPAGE P="52"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Federal cost principles; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the Memorandum of Understanding for the one-stop delivery system and what must be included in the Memorandum of Understanding?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The MOU is the product of local discussion and negotiation, and is an agreement developed and executed between the Local WDB and the one-stop partners, with the agreement of the chief elected official and the one-stop partners, relating to the operation of the one-stop delivery system in the local area. Two or more local areas in a region may develop a single joint MOU, if they are in a region that has submitted a regional plan under sec. 106 of WIOA.</P>
              <P>(b) The MOU must include:</P>
              <P>(1) A description of services to be provided through the one-stop delivery system, including the manner in which the services will be coordinated and delivered through the system;</P>
              <P>(2) Agreement on funding the costs of the services and the operating costs of the system, including:</P>
              <P>(i) Funding of infrastructure costs of one-stop centers in accordance with §§ 463.700 through 463.755; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Funding of the shared services and operating costs of the one-stop delivery system described in § 463.760;</P>
              <P>(3) Methods for referring individuals between the one-stop operators and partners for appropriate services and activities;</P>
              <P>(4) Methods to ensure that the needs of workers, youth, and individuals with barriers to employment, including individuals with disabilities, are addressed in providing access to services, including access to technology and materials that are available through the one-stop delivery system;</P>
              <P>(5) The duration of the MOU and procedures for amending it; and</P>
              <P>(6) Assurances that each MOU will be reviewed, and if substantial changes have occurred, renewed, not less than once every 3-year period to ensure appropriate funding and delivery of services.</P>
              <P>(c) The MOU may contain any other provisions agreed to by the parties that are consistent with WIOA title I, the authorizing statutes and regulations of one-stop partner programs, and the WIOA regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) When fully executed, the MOU must contain the signatures of the Local WDB, one-stop partners, the chief elected official(s), and the time period in which the agreement is effective. The MOU must be updated not less than every 3 years to reflect any changes in the signatory official of the Board, one-stop partners, and chief elected officials, or one-stop infrastructure funding.</P>
              <P>(e) If a one-stop partner appeal to the State regarding infrastructure costs, using the process described in § 463.750, results in a change to the one-stop partner's infrastructure cost contributions, the MOU must be updated to reflect the final one-stop partner infrastructure cost contributions.</P>

              <P>(a) A single “umbrella” MOU may be developed that addresses the issues relating to the local one-stop delivery system for the Local WDB, chief elected official and all partners. Alternatively, the Local WDB (with agreement of chief elected official) may enter into separate agreements between each partner or groups of partners.</P>

              <P>(b) Under either approach, the requirements described in § 463.500 apply. Since funds are generally appropriated annually, the Local WDB may negotiate financial agreements with each partner annually to update funding of <PRTPAGE P="56"/>services and operating costs of the system under the MOU.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How must the Memorandum of Understanding be negotiated?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) WIOA emphasizes full and effective partnerships between Local WDBs, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners. Local WDBs and partners must enter into good-faith negotiations. Local WDBs, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners may also request assistance from a State agency responsible for administering the partner program, the Governor, State WDB, or other appropriate parties on other aspects of the MOU.</P>
              <P>(b) Local WDBs and one-stop partners must establish, in the MOU, how they will fund the infrastructure costs and other shared costs of the one-stop centers. If agreement regarding infrastructure costs is not reached when other sections of the MOU are ready, an interim infrastructure funding agreement may be included instead, as described in § 463.715(c). Once agreement on infrastructure funding is reached, the Local WDB and one-stop partners must amend the MOU to include the infrastructure funding of the one-stop centers. Infrastructure funding is described in detail in §§ 463.700 through 463.760.</P>
              <P>(c) The Local WDB must report to the State WDB, Governor, and relevant State agency when MOU negotiations with one-stop partners have reached an impasse.</P>
              <P>(1) The Local WDB and partners must document the negotiations and efforts that have taken place in the MOU. The State WDB, one-stop partner programs, and the Governor may consult with the appropriate Federal agencies to address impasse situations related to issues other than infrastructure funding after attempting to address the impasse. Impasses related to infrastructure cost funding must be resolved using the State infrastructure cost funding mechanism described in § 463.730.</P>
              <P>(2) The Local WDB must report failure to execute an MOU with a required partner to the Governor, State WDB, and the State agency responsible for administering the partner's program. Additionally, if the State cannot assist the Local WDB in resolving the impasse, the Governor or the State WDB must report the failure to the Secretary of Labor and to the head of any other Federal agency with responsibility for oversight of a partner's program.</P>

              <P>(1) An institution of higher education;</P>
              <P>(2) An Employment Service State agency established under the Wagner-Peyser Act;</P>

A State may require, or a Local WDB may choose to implement, a competitive selection process more than once every 4 years.</P>
              <P>(b) In instances in which a State is conducting the competitive process described in paragraph (a) of this section, the State must follow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurement with non-Federal funds.</P>
              <P>(c) All other non-Federal entities, including subrecipients of a State (such as local areas), must use a competitive process based on local procurement policies and procedures and the principles of competitive procurement in the Uniform Guidance set out at 2 CFR 200.318 through 200.326.

              <P>(a) States may select a one-stop operator through sole source selection when allowed under the same policies and procedures used for competitive procurement with non-Federal funds, while other non-Federal entities including subrecipients of a State (such as local areas) may select a one-stop operator through sole selection when consistent with local procurement policies and procedures and the Uniform Guidance set out at 2 CFR 200.320.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event that sole source procurement is determined necessary and reasonable, in accordance with § 463.605(c), written documentation must be prepared and maintained concerning the entire process of making such a selection.</P>
              <P>(c) Such sole source procurement must include appropriate conflict of interest policies and procedures. These policies and procedures must conform to the specifications in 20 CFR 679.430 for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflict of interest.</P>
              <P>(d) A Local WDB may be selected as a one-stop operator through sole source procurement only with agreement of the chief elected official in the local area and the Governor.

              <SUBJECT>What is the one-stop operator's role?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) At a minimum, the one-stop operator must coordinate the service delivery of required one-stop partners and service providers. Local WDBs may establish additional roles of one-stop operator, including, but not limited to: Coordinating service providers across the one-stop delivery system, being the primary provider of services within the center, providing some of the services within the center, or coordinating service delivery in a multi-center area, which may include affiliated sites. The competition for a one-stop operator must clearly articulate the role of the one-stop operator.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a one-stop operator may not perform the following functions: Convene system stakeholders to assist in the development of the local plan; prepare and submit local plans (as required under sec. 107 of WIOA); be responsible for oversight of itself; manage or significantly participate in the competitive selection process for one-stop operators; select or terminate one-stop operators, career services, and youth providers; negotiate local performance accountability measures; or develop and submit budget for activities of the Local WDB in the local area.</P>
              <P>(2) An entity serving as a one-stop operator, that also serves a different role within the one-stop delivery system, may perform some or all of these functions when it is acting in its other role, if it has established sufficient firewalls and conflict of interest policies and procedures. The policies and procedures must conform to the specifications in 20 CFR 679.430 for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflict of interest.</P>

              <P>Yes, but there must be appropriate firewalls in place in regards to the competition, and subsequent oversight, monitoring, and evaluation of performance of the service provider. The operator cannot develop, manage, or conduct the competition of a service provider in which it intends to compete. In cases where an operator is also a service provider, there must be firewalls and internal controls within the operator-service provider entity, as well as specific policies and procedures at the Local WDB level regarding oversight, monitoring, and evaluation of performance of the service provider. The firewalls must conform to the specifications in 20 CFR 679.430 for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflicts of interest.</P>

              <P>(a) In the local funding mechanism, the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners agree to amounts and methods of calculating amounts each partner will contribute for one-stop infrastructure funding, include the infrastructure funding terms in the MOU, and sign the MOU. The local funding mechanism must meet all of the following requirements:</P>

              <P>(1) The infrastructure costs are funded through cash and fairly evaluated non-cash and third-party in-kind partner contributions and include any funding from philanthropic organizations or other private entities, or through other alternative financing options, to provide a stable and equitable funding stream for ongoing one-stop delivery system operations;<PRTPAGE P="60"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Contributions must be negotiated between one-stop partners, chief elected officials, and the Local WDB and the amount to be contributed must be included in the MOU;</P>
              <P>(3) The one-stop partner program's proportionate share of funding must be calculated in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR part 200 based upon a reasonable cost allocation methodology whereby infrastructure costs are charged to each partner in proportion to its use of the one-stop center, relative to benefits received. Such costs must also be allowable, reasonable, necessary, and allocable;</P>
              <P>(4) Partner shares must be periodically reviewed and reconciled against actual costs incurred, and adjusted to ensure that actual costs charged to any one-stop partners are proportionate to the use of the one-stop center and relative to the benefit received by the one-stop partners and their respective programs or activities.</P>
              <P>(b) In developing the section of the MOU on one-stop infrastructure funding described in § 463.755, the Local WDB and chief elected officials will:</P>
              <P>(1) Ensure that the one-stop partners adhere to the guidance identified in § 463.705 on one-stop delivery system infrastructure costs.</P>
              <P>(2) Work with one-stop partners to achieve consensus and informally mediate any possible conflicts or disagreements among one-stop partners.</P>
              <P>(3) Provide technical assistance to new one-stop partners and local grant recipients to ensure that those entities are informed and knowledgeable of the elements contained in the MOU and the one-stop infrastructure costs arrangement.</P>
              <P>(c) The MOU may include an interim infrastructure funding agreement, including as much detail as the Local WDB has negotiated with one-stop partners, if all other parts of the MOU have been negotiated, in order to allow the partner programs to operate in the one-stop centers. The interim infrastructure funding agreement must be finalized within 6 months of when the MOU is signed. If the interim infrastructure funding agreement is not finalized within that timeframe, the Local WDB must notify the Governor, as described in § 463.725.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What funds are used to pay for infrastructure costs in the local one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In the local funding mechanism, one-stop partner programs may determine what funds they will use to pay for infrastructure costs. The use of these funds must be in accordance with the requirements in this subpart, and with the relevant partner's authorizing statutes and regulations, including, for example, prohibitions against supplanting non-Federal resources, statutory limitations on administrative costs, and all other applicable legal requirements. In the case of partners administering programs authorized by title I of WIOA, these infrastructure costs may be considered program costs. In the case of partners administering adult education and literacy programs authorized by title II of WIOA, these funds must include Federal funds made available for the local administration of adult education and literacy programs authorized by title II of WIOA. These funds may also include non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind or third-party contributions. In the case of partners administering the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, funds used to pay for infrastructure costs may include funds available for local administrative expenses, non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind or third-party contributions, and may include other funds made available by the State.</P>

              <P>(b) There are no specific caps on the amount or percent of overall funding a one-stop partner may contribute to fund infrastructure costs under the local funding mechanism, except that contributions for administrative costs may not exceed the amount available for administrative costs under the authorizing statute of the partner program. However, amounts contributed for infrastructure costs must be allowable and based on proportionate use of the one-stop centers and relative benefit received by the partner program, taking into account the total cost of the one-stop infrastructure as well as <PRTPAGE P="61"/>alternate financing options, and must be consistent with 2 CFR part 200, including the Federal cost principles.</P>
              <P>(c) Cash, non-cash, and third-party in-kind contributions may be provided by one-stop partners to cover their proportionate share of infrastructure costs.</P>
              <P>(1) Cash contributions are cash funds provided to the Local WDB or its designee by one-stop partners, either directly or by an interagency transfer.</P>
              <P>(2) Non-cash contributions are comprised of—</P>
              <P>(i) Expenditures incurred by one-stop partners on behalf of the one-stop center; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Non-cash contributions or goods or services contributed by a partner program and used by the one-stop center.</P>
              <P>(3) Non-cash contributions, especially those set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, must be valued consistent with 2 CFR 200.306 to ensure they are fairly evaluated and meet the partners' proportionate share.</P>
              <P>(4) Third-party in-kind contributions are:</P>
              <P>(i) Contributions of space, equipment, technology, non-personnel services, or other like items to support the infrastructure costs associated with one-stop operations, by a non-one-stop partner to support the one-stop center in general, not a specific partner; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Contributions by a non-one-stop partner of space, equipment, technology, non-personnel services, or other like items to support the infrastructure costs associated with one-stop operations, to a one-stop partner to support its proportionate share of one-stop infrastructure costs.</P>
              <P>(iii) In-kind contributions described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section must be valued consistent with 2 CFR 200.306 and reconciled on a regular basis to ensure they are fairly evaluated and meet the proportionate share of the partner.</P>

              <P>(5) All partner contributions, regardless of the type, must be reconciled on a regular basis (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> monthly or quarterly), comparing actual expenses incurred to relative benefits received, to ensure each partner program is contributing its proportionate share in accordance with the terms of the MOU.</P>

              <P>With regard to negotiations for infrastructure funding for Program Year (PY) 2017 and for each subsequent program year thereafter, if the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners do not reach consensus on methods of sufficiently funding local infrastructure through the local funding mechanism in accordance with the Governor's guidance issued under § 463.705 and consistent with the regulations in §§ 463.715 and 463.720, and include that consensus agreement in the signed MOU, then the Local WDB must notify the Governor by the deadline established by the Governor under § 463.705(b)(3). Once notified, the Governor must administer funding through the State funding mechanism, as described in §§ 463.730 through 463.738, for the program year impacted by the local area's failure to reach consensus.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the State one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Consistent with sec. 121(h)(1)(A)(i)(II) of WIOA, if the Local WDB, chief elected official, and one-stop partners in a local area do not reach consensus agreement on methods of sufficiently funding the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers for a program year, the State funding mechanism is applicable to the local area for that program year.</P>
              <P>(b) In the State funding mechanism, the Governor, subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this section, determines one-stop partner contributions after consultation with the chief elected officials, Local WDBs, and the State WDB. This determination involves:</P>
              <P>(1) The application of a budget for one-stop infrastructure costs as described in § 463.735, based on either agreement reached in the local area negotiations or the State WDB formula outlined in § 463.745;</P>

              <P>(2) The determination of each local one-stop partner program's proportionate use of the one-stop delivery system and relative benefit received, <PRTPAGE P="62"/>consistent with the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, including the Federal cost principles, the partner programs' authorizing laws and regulations, and other applicable legal requirements described in § 463.736; and</P>
              <P>(3) The calculation of required statewide program caps on contributions to infrastructure costs from one-stop partner programs in areas operating under the State funding mechanism as described in § 463.738.</P>
              <P>(c) In certain situations, the Governor does not determine the infrastructure cost contributions for some one-stop partner programs under the State funding mechanism.</P>
              <P>(1) The Governor will not determine the contribution amounts for infrastructure funds for Native American program grantees described in 20 CFR part 684. The appropriate portion of funds to be provided by Native American program grantees to pay for one-stop infrastructure must be determined as part of the development of the MOU described in § 463.500 and specified in that MOU.</P>
              <P>(2) In States in which the policy-making authority is placed in an entity or official that is independent of the authority of the Governor with respect to the funds provided for adult education and literacy activities authorized under title II of WIOA, postsecondary career and technical education activities authorized under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, or VR services authorized under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (other than sec. 112 or part C), as amended by WIOA title IV, the determination of the amount each of the applicable partners must contribute to assist in paying the infrastructure costs of one-stop centers must be made by the official or chief officer of the entity with such authority, in consultation with the Governor.</P>
              <P>(d) Any duty, ability, choice, responsibility, or other action otherwise related to the determination of infrastructure costs contributions that is assigned to the Governor in §§ 463.730 through 463.745 also applies to this decision-making process performed by the official or chief officer described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) To initiate the State funding mechanism, a Local WDB that has not reached consensus on methods of sufficiently funding local infrastructure through the local funding mechanism as provided in § 463.725 must notify the Governor by the deadline established by the Governor under § 463.705(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(b) Once a Local WDB has informed the Governor that no consensus has been reached:</P>
              <P>(1) The Local WDB must provide the Governor with local negotiation materials in accordance with § 463.735(a).</P>
              <P>(2) The Governor must determine the one-stop center budget by either:</P>
              <P>(i) Accepting a budget previously agreed upon by partner programs in the local negotiations, in accordance with § 463.735(b)(1); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Creating a budget for the one-stop center using the State WDB formula (described in § 463.745) in accordance with § 463.735(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(3) The Governor then must establish a cost allocation methodology to determine the one-stop partner programs' proportionate shares of infrastructure costs, in accordance with § 463.736.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) Using the methodology established under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, and taking into consideration the factors concerning individual partner programs listed in § 463.737(b)(2), the Governor must determine each partner's proportionate share of the infrastructure costs, in accordance with § 463.737(b)(1), and</P>
              <P>(ii) In accordance with § 463.730(c), in some instances, the Governor does not determine a partner program's proportionate share of infrastructure funding costs, in which case it must be determined by the entities named in § 463.730(c)(1) and (2).</P>

              <P>(5) The Governor must then calculate the statewide caps on the amounts that partner programs may be required to contribute toward infrastructure funding, according to the steps found at § 463.738(a)(1) through (4).<PRTPAGE P="63"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) The Governor must ensure that the aggregate total of the infrastructure contributions according to proportionate share required of all local partner programs in local areas under the State funding mechanism do not exceed the cap for that particular program, in accordance with § 463.738(b)(1). If the total does not exceed the cap, the Governor must direct each one-stop partner program to pay the amount determined under § 463.737(a) toward the infrastructure funding costs of the one-stop center. If the total does exceed the cap, then to determine the amount to direct each one-stop program to pay, the Governor may:</P>
              <P>(i) Ascertain, in accordance with § 463.738(b)(2)(i), whether the local partner or partners whose proportionate shares are calculated above the individual program caps are willing to voluntarily contribute above the capped amount to equal that program's proportionate share; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Choose from the options provided in § 463.738(b)(2)(ii), including having the local area re-enter negotiations to reassess each one-stop partner's proportionate share and make adjustments or identify alternate sources of funding to make up the difference between the capped amount and the proportionate share of infrastructure funding of the one-stop partner.</P>
              <P>(7) If none of the solutions given in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section prove to be viable, the Governor must reassess the proportionate shares of each one-stop partner so that the aggregate amount attributable to the local partners for each program is less than that program's cap amount. Upon such reassessment, the Governor must direct each one-stop partner program to pay the reassessed amount toward the infrastructure funding costs of the one-stop center.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) If a local area has reached agreement as to the infrastructure budget for the one-stop centers in the local area, it must provide this budget to the Governor as required by paragraph (a) of this section. If, as a result of the agreed upon infrastructure budget, only the individual programmatic contributions to infrastructure funding based upon proportionate use of the one-stop centers and relative benefit received are at issue, the Governor may accept the budget, from which the Governor must calculate each partner's contribution consistent with the cost allocation methodologies contained in the Uniform Guidance found in 2 CFR part 200, as described in § 463.736.</P>
              <P>(2) The Governor may also take into consideration the extent to which the partners in the local area have agreed in determining the proportionate shares, including any agreements reached at the local level by one or more partners, as well as any other element or product of the negotiating process provided to the Governor as required by paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If a local area has not reached agreement as to the infrastructure budget for the one-stop centers in the local area, or if the Governor determines that the agreed upon budget does not adequately meet the needs of the local area or does not reasonably work within the confines of the local area's resources in accordance with the Governor's one-stop budget guidance (which is required to be issued by WIOA sec. 121(h)(1)(B) and under § 463.705), then, in accordance with § 463.745, the Governor must use the formula developed by the State WDB based on at least the factors required under § 463.745, and any associated weights to determine the local area budget.</P>

              <P>(a) The Governor must calculate the statewide cap on the contributions for one-stop infrastructure funding required to be provided by each one-stop partner program for those local areas that have not reached agreement. The cap is the amount determined under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, which the Governor derives by:</P>
              <P>(1) First, determining the amount resulting from applying the percentage for the corresponding one-stop partner program provided in paragraph (d) of this section to the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out the one-stop partner program in the State for the applicable fiscal year;</P>
              <P>(2) Second, selecting a factor (or factors) that reasonably indicates the use of one-stop centers in the State, applying such factor(s) to all local areas in the State, and determining the percentage of such factor(s) applicable to the local areas that reached agreement under the local funding mechanism in the State;</P>
              <P>(3) Third, determining the amount resulting from applying the percentage determined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to the amount determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the one-stop partner program; and</P>
              <P>(4) Fourth, determining the amount that results from subtracting the amount determined under paragraph (a)(3) of this section from the amount determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The outcome of this final calculation results in the partner program's cap.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) The Governor must ensure that the funds required to be contributed by each partner program in the local areas in the State under the State funding <PRTPAGE P="65"/>mechanism, in aggregate, do not exceed the statewide cap for each program as determined under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the contributions initially determined under § 463.737 would exceed the applicable cap determined under paragraph (a) of this section, the Governor may:</P>
              <P>(i) Ascertain if the one-stop partner whose contribution would otherwise exceed the cap determined under paragraph (a) of this section will voluntarily contribute above the capped amount, so that the total contributions equal that partner's proportionate share. The one-stop partner's contribution must still be consistent with the program's authorizing laws and regulations, the Federal cost principles in 2 CFR part 200, and other applicable legal requirements; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Direct or allow the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners to: Re-enter negotiations, as necessary; reduce the infrastructure costs to reflect the amount of funds that are available for such costs without exceeding the cap levels; reassess the proportionate share of each one-stop partner; or identify alternative sources of financing for one-stop infrastructure funding, consistent with the requirement that each one-stop partner pay an amount that is consistent with the proportionate use of the one-stop center and relative benefit received by the partner, the program's authorizing laws and regulations, the Federal cost principles in 2 CFR part 200, and other applicable legal requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) If applicable under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners, after renegotiation, may come to agreement, sign an MOU, and proceed under the local funding mechanism. Such actions do not require the redetermination of the applicable caps under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) If, after renegotiation, agreement among partners still cannot be reached or alternate financing cannot be identified, the Governor may adjust the specified allocation, in accordance with the amounts available and the limitations described in paragraph (d) of this section. In determining these adjustments, the Governor may take into account information relating to the renegotiation as well as the information described in § 463.735(a).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> Subject to paragraph (a) of this section and in accordance with WIOA sec. 121(h)(2)(D), the following limitations apply to the Governor's calculations of the amount that one-stop partners in local areas that have not reached agreement under the local funding mechanism may be required under § 463.736 to contribute to one-stop infrastructure funding:</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Other one-stop partners.</E> For required one-stop partners other than those specified in paragraphs (c)(1), (3), (5), and (6) of this section, the portion of funds required to be contributed must not exceed 1.5 percent of the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out that program in the State for a fiscal year. For purposes of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, the cap on contributions is determined based on the funds made available by the State for postsecondary level programs and activities under sec. 132 of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act and the amount of funds used by the State under sec. 112(a)(3) of the Perkins Act during the prior year to administer postsecondary level programs and activities, as applicable.</P>

              <P>(5) <E T="03">TANF programs.</E> For purposes of TANF, the cap on contributions is determined based on the total Federal TANF funds expended by the State for work, education, and training activities during the prior Federal fiscal year (as reported to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the quarterly TANF Financial Report form), plus any additional amount of Federal TANF funds that the State TANF agency reasonably determines was expended for administrative costs in connection with these activities but that was separately reported to HHS as an administrative cost. The State's contribution to the one-stop infrastructure must not exceed 1.5 percent of these combined expenditures.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) programs.</E> For purposes of CSBG, the cap on contributions will be based on the total amount of CSBG funds determined by the State to have been expended by local CSBG-eligible entities for the provision of employment and training activities during the prior Federal fiscal year for which information is available (as reported to HHS on the CSBG Annual Report) and any additional amount that the State CSBG agency reasonably determines was expended for administrative purposes in connection with these activities and was separately reported to HHS as an administrative cost. The State's contribution must not exceed 1.5 percent of these combined expenditures.</P>
              <P>(d) For programs for which it is not otherwise feasible to determine the amount of Federal funding used by the program until the end of that program's operational year—because, for example, the funding available for education, employment, and training activities is included within funding for the program that may also be used for other unrelated activities—the determination of the Federal funds provided to carry out the program for a fiscal year under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be determined by:</P>
              <P>(1) The percentage of Federal funds available to the one-stop partner program that were used by the one-stop partner program for education, employment, and training activities in the previous fiscal year for which data are available; and</P>

              <P>(a) In the State funding mechanism, infrastructure costs for WIOA title I programs, including Native American Programs described in 20 CFR part 684, may be paid using program funds, administrative funds, or both. Infrastructure costs for the Senior Community Service Employment Program under title V of the Older Americans Act (42 U.S.C. 3056 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) may also be paid <PRTPAGE P="67"/>using program funds, administrative funds, or both.</P>
              <P>(b) In the State funding mechanism, infrastructure costs for other required one-stop partner programs (listed in §§ 463.400 through 463.410) are limited to the program's administrative funds, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) In the State funding mechanism, infrastructure costs for the adult education program authorized by title II of WIOA must be paid from the funds that are available for local administration and may be paid from funds made available by the State or non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind, or third-party contributions.</P>
              <P>(d) In the State funding mechanism, infrastructure costs for the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 must be paid from funds available for local administration of postsecondary level programs and activities to eligible recipients or consortia of eligible recipients and may be paid from funds made available by the State or non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind, or third-party contributions.</P>

              <P>The State WDB must develop a formula, as described in WIOA sec. 121(h)(3)(B), to be used by the Governor under § 463.735(b)(3) in determining the appropriate budget for the infrastructure costs of one-stop centers in the local areas that do not reach agreement under the local funding mechanism and are, therefore, subject to the State funding mechanism. The formula identifies the factors and corresponding weights for each factor that the Governor must use, which must include: the number of one-stop centers in a local area; the population served by such centers; the services provided by such centers; and any factors relating to the operations of such centers in the local area that the State WDB determines are appropriate. As indicated in § 463.735(b)(1), if the local area has agreed on such a budget, the Governor may accept that budget in lieu of applying the formula factors.</P>

              <P>(a) The Governor must establish a process, described under sec. 121(h)(2)(E) of WIOA, for a one-stop partner administering a program described in §§ 463.400 through 463.410 to appeal the Governor's determination regarding the one-stop partner's portion of funds to be provided for one-stop infrastructure costs. This appeal process must be described in the Unified State Plan.</P>
              <P>(b) The appeal may be made on the ground that the Governor's determination is inconsistent with proportionate share requirements in § 463.735(a), the cost contribution limitations in § 463.735(b), the cost contribution caps in § 463.738, consistent with the process described in the State Plan.</P>
              <P>(c) The process must ensure prompt resolution of the appeal in order to ensure the funds are distributed in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of 20 CFR 683.630.</P>
              <P>(d) The one-stop partner must submit an appeal in accordance with State's deadlines for appeals specified in the guidance issued under § 463.705(b)(3), or if the State has not set a deadline, within 21 days from the Governor's determination.</P>

              <P>(a) In addition to jointly funding infrastructure costs, one-stop partners listed in §§ 463.400 through 463.410 must use a portion of funds made available under their programs' authorizing Federal law (or fairly evaluated in-kind contributions) to pay the additional costs relating to the operation of the one-stop delivery system. These other costs must include applicable career services and may include other costs, including shared services.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, shared services' costs may include the costs of shared services that are authorized for and may be commonly provided through the one-stop partner programs to any individual, such as initial intake, assessment of needs, appraisal of basic skills, identification of appropriate services to meet such needs, referrals to other one-stop partners, and business services. Shared operating costs may also include shared costs of the Local WDB's functions.</P>
              <P>(c) Contributions to the additional costs related to operation of the one-stop delivery system may be cash, non-cash, or third-party in-kind contributions, consistent with how these are described in § 463.720(c).</P>
              <P>(d) The shared costs described in paragraph (a) of this section must be allocated according to the proportion of benefit received by each of the partners, consistent with the Federal law authorizing the partner's program, and consistent with all other applicable legal requirements, including Federal cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 (or any corresponding similar regulation or ruling) requiring that costs are allowable, reasonable, necessary, and allocable.</P>

              <P>(a) The State WDB, in consultation with chief elected officials and Local WDBs, must establish objective criteria and procedures for Local WDBs to use when certifying one-stop centers.</P>
              <P>(1) The State WDB, in consultation with chief elected officials and Local WDBs, must review and update the criteria every 2 years as part of the review and modification of State Plans pursuant to § 463.135.</P>
              <P>(2) The criteria must be consistent with the Governor's and State WDB's guidelines, guidance, and policies on infrastructure funding decisions, described in § 463.705. The criteria must evaluate the one-stop centers and one-stop delivery system for effectiveness, including customer satisfaction, physical and programmatic accessibility, and continuous improvement.</P>
              <P>(3) When the Local WDB is the one-stop operator as described in 20 CFR 679.410, the State WDB must certify the one-stop center.</P>

              <P>(b) Evaluations of effectiveness must include how well the one-stop center integrates available services for participants and businesses, meets the workforce development needs of participants and the employment needs of <PRTPAGE P="69"/>local employers, operates in a cost-efficient manner, coordinates services among the one-stop partner programs, and provides access to partner program services to the maximum extent practicable, including providing services outside of regular business hours where there is a workforce need, as identified by the Local WDB. These evaluations must take into account feedback from one-stop customers. They must also include evaluations of how well the one-stop center ensures equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities to participate in or benefit from one-stop center services. These evaluations must include criteria evaluating how well the centers and delivery systems take actions to comply with the disability-related regulations implementing WIOA sec. 188, set forth at 29 CFR part 38. Such actions include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Providing reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities;</P>
              <P>(2) Making reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures where necessary to avoid discrimination against persons with disabilities;</P>
              <P>(3) Administering programs in the most integrated setting appropriate;</P>
              <P>(4) Communicating with persons with disabilities as effectively as with others;</P>
              <P>(5) Providing appropriate auxiliary aids and services, including assistive technology devices and services, where necessary to afford individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, the program or activity; and</P>
              <P>(6) Providing for the physical accessibility of the one-stop center to individuals with disabilities.</P>
              <P>(c) Evaluations of continuous improvement must include how well the one-stop center supports the achievement of the negotiated local levels of performance for the indicators of performance for the local area described in sec. 116(b)(2) of WIOA and part 463. Other continuous improvement factors may include a regular process for identifying and responding to technical assistance needs, a regular system of continuing professional staff development, and having systems in place to capture and respond to specific customer feedback.</P>
              <P>(d) Local WDBs must assess at least once every 3 years the effectiveness, physical and programmatic accessibility, and continuous improvement of one-stop centers and the one-stop delivery systems using the criteria and procedures developed by the State WDB. The Local WDB may establish additional criteria, or set higher standards for service coordination, than those set by the State criteria. Local WDBs must review and update the criteria every 2 years as part of the Local Plan update process described in § 463.580. Local WDBs must certify one-stop centers in order to be eligible to use infrastructure funds in the State funding mechanism described in § 463.730.</P>
              <P>(e) All one-stop centers must comply with applicable physical and programmatic accessibility requirements, as set forth in 29 CFR part 38, the implementing regulations of WIOA sec. 188.</P>

              <P>(3) Eligibility does not extend to any location that an institution establishes after it receives its eligibility designation if the institution provides at least 50 percent of an educational program at that location, unless—</P>

              <P>(ii) Pursuant to a requirement regarding additional programs included in the institution's program participation agreement under 34 CFR 668.14, obtain the Secretary's approval; and</P>

              <P>(2) Except as provided under § 600.20(c), an eligible institution does not have to obtain the Secretary's approval to establish the eligibility of any program that is not described in paragraph (c)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) An institution must repay to the Secretary all HEA program funds received by the institution for an educational program, and all the title IV, HEA program funds received by or on behalf of students who enrolled in that program if the institution—</P>

              <P>(2) If an institution participates in an HEA program other than a title IV, HEA program, the Secretary's designation of the institution as an eligible institution, for purposes of that non-title IV, HEA program, does not expire as long as the institution continues to satisfy the statutory and regulatory requirements governing its eligibility.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Consequence of eligibility.</E> (1) If, as a part of its institutional eligibility application, an institution indicates that it wishes to participate in a title IV, HEA program and the Secretary determines that the institution satisfies the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements governing institutional eligibility, the Secretary will determine whether the institution satisfies the standards of administrative capability and financial responsibility contained in 34 CFR part 668, subpart B.</P>
              <P>(2) If, as part of its institutional eligibility application, an institution indicates that it does not wish to participate in any title IV, HEA program and the Secretary determines that the institution satisfies the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements governing institutional eligibility, the institution is eligible to apply to participate in any HEA program listed by the Secretary in the eligibility notice it receives under § 600.21. However, the institution is not eligible to participate in those programs, or receive funds under those programs, merely by virtue of its designation as an eligible institution under this part.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a private nonprofit, private for-profit, or public institution that undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change in control ceases to qualify as an eligible institution upon the change in ownership and control. A change in ownership that results in a change in control includes any change by which a person who has or thereby acquires an ownership interest in the entity that owns the institution or the parent corporation of that entity, acquires or loses the ability to control the institution.</P>
              <P>(2) If a private nonprofit, private for-profit, or public institution has undergone a change in ownership that results in a change in control, the Secretary may, under the provisions of § 600.20(g) and (h), continue the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs on a provisional basis, provided that the institution submits, under the provisions of § 600.20(g), a materially complete application—</P>
              <P>(i) No later than 10 business days after the change occurs; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For an institution owned by a publicly-traded corporation, no later than 10 business days after the institution knew, or should have known of the change based upon SEC filings, that the change occurred.</P>
              <P>(3) In order to reestablish eligibility and to resume participation in the title IV, HEA programs, the institution must demonstrate to the Secretary that after the change in ownership and control—</P>
              <P>(i) The institution satisfies all the applicable requirements contained in §§ 600.4, 600.5, and 600.6, except that if the institution is a proprietary institution of higher education or postsecondary vocational institution, it need not have been in existence for two years before seeking eligibility; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The institution qualifies to be certified to participate under 34 CFR part 668, subpart B.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to terms used in this section:</P>

                <E T="03">Ownership or ownership interest.</E> (1) Ownership or ownership interest means a legal or beneficial interest in an institution or its corporate parent, or a right to share in the profits derived from the operation of an institution or its corporate parent.</P>

              <P>(i) A mutual fund that is regularly and publicly traded;</P>
              <P>(ii) A U.S. institutional investor, as defined in 17 CFR 240.15a-6(b)(7);</P>

              <P>(i) A person acquires such ownership and control of the corporation so that the corporation is required to file a Form 8K with the SEC notifying that agency of the change in control; or</P>
              <P>(ii) (A) A person who is a controlling shareholder of the corporation ceases to be a controlling shareholder. A controlling shareholder is a shareholder who holds or controls through agreement both 25 percent or more of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and more shares of voting stock than any other shareholder.

              <P>(C) If a publicly-traded institution is provisionally certified due to a change in ownership under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, and that institution experiences another change of ownership under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, an approval of the subsequent change in ownership does not extend the original expiration date for the provisional certification provided that any current controlling shareholder was listed on the change of ownership application for which the original provisional approval was granted.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other corporations.</E> A change in ownership and control of a corporation that is neither closely-held nor required to be registered with the SEC occurs when—</P>

              <P>(i) A person who has or acquires an ownership interest acquires both control of at least 25 percent of the total <PRTPAGE P="99"/>outstanding voting stock of the corporation and control of the corporation;</P>

              <P>(7) <E T="03">Public institution.</E> The Secretary does not consider that a public institution undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change of control if there is a change in governance and the institution after the change remains a public institution, provided—</P>

              <P>(ii) The new governing authority has acknowledged the public institution's continued responsibilities under its program participation agreement.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Covered transactions.</E> For the purposes of this section, a change in ownership of an institution that results in a change of control may include, but is not limited to—</P>

              <P>(1) If the basis for the loss of eligibility is the loss of accreditation or preaccreditation, the sole issue is whether the institution, location, or program has the requisite accreditation or preaccreditation. The presiding official has no authority to consider challenges to the action of the accrediting agency.</P>
              <P>(2) If the basis for the loss of eligibility is the loss of legal authorization, the sole issue is whether the institution, location, or program has the requisite legal authorization. The presiding official has no authority to consider challenges to the action of a State agency in removing the legal authorization.</P>
              <P>(3) If the basis for the loss of eligibility of a foreign graduate medical school is one or more annual pass rates on the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination below the threshold required in § 600.55(f)(1)(ii), the sole issue is whether one or more of the foreign medical school's pass rate or rates for the preceding calendar year fell below that threshold. For a foreign graduate medical school that opted to have the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) calculate and provide the pass rates directly to the Secretary for the preceding calendar year as permitted under § 600.55(d)(2) in lieu of the foreign graduate medical school providing pass rate data to the Secretary under § 600.55(d)(1)(iii), the ECFMG's calculations of the school's rates are conclusive; and the presiding official has no authority to consider challenges to the computation of the rate or rates by the ECFMG.</P>

                <P>(a) If the agency accredits institutions, it must maintain adequate substantive change policies that ensure that any substantive change to the educational mission, program, or programs of an institution after the agency has accredited or preaccredited the institution does not adversely affect the capacity of the institution to continue to meet the agency's standards. The agency meets this requirement if—</P>
                <P>(1) The agency requires the institution to obtain the agency's approval of the substantive change before the agency includes the change in the scope of accreditation or preaccreditation it previously granted to the institution; and</P>
                <P>(2) The agency's definition of substantive change includes at least the following types of change:</P>
                <P>(i) Any change in the established mission or objectives of the institution.</P>
                <P>(ii) Any change in the legal status, form of control, or ownership of the institution.</P>
                <P>(iii) The addition of courses or programs that represent a significant departure from the existing offerings of educational programs, or method of delivery, from those that were offered when the agency last evaluated the institution.</P>
                <P>(iv) The addition of programs of study at a degree or credential level different from that which is included in the institution's current accreditation or preaccreditation.</P>
                <P>(v) A change from clock hours to credit hours.</P>
                <P>(vi) A substantial increase in the number of clock or credit hours awarded for successful completion of a program.</P>
                <P>(vii) If the agency's accreditation of an institution enables the institution to seek eligibility to participate in title IV, HEA programs, the entering into a contract under which an institution or organization not certified to participate in the title IV, HEA programs offers more than 25 percent of one or more of the accredited institution's educational programs.</P>
                <P>(viii)(A) If the agency's accreditation of an institution enables it to seek eligibility to participate in title IV, HEA programs, the establishment of an additional location at which the institution offers at least 50 percent of an educational program. The addition of such a location must be approved by the agency in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section unless the accrediting agency determines, and issues a written determination stating that the institution has—</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Successfully completed at least one cycle of accreditation of maximum length offered by the agency and one renewal, or has been accredited for at least ten years;<PRTPAGE P="130"/>

                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Met criteria established by the agency indicating sufficient capacity to add additional locations without individual prior approvals, including at a minimum satisfactory evidence of a system to ensure quality across a distributed enterprise that includes—</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Clearly identified academic control;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Regular evaluation of the locations;</P>

                <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) Long-range planning for expansion.</P>
                <P>(B) The agency's procedures for approval of an additional location, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(A) of this section, must require timely reporting to the agency of every additional location established under this approval.</P>
                <P>(C) Each agency determination or redetermination to preapprove an institution's addition of locations under paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(A) of this section may not exceed five years.</P>
                <P>(D) The agency may not preapprove an institution's addition of locations under paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(A) of this section after the institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control as defined in 34 CFR 600.31 until the institution demonstrates that it meets the conditions for the agency to preapprove additional locations described in this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(E) The agency must have an effective mechanism for conducting, at reasonable intervals, visits to a representative sample of additional locations approved under paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(A) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ix) The acquisition of any other institution or any program or location of another institution.</P>
                <P>(x) The addition of a permanent location at a site at which the institution is conducting a teach-out for students of another institution that has ceased operating before all students have completed their program of study.</P>
                <P>(3) The agency's substantive change policy must define when the changes made or proposed by an institution are or would be sufficiently extensive to require the agency to conduct a new comprehensive evaluation of that institution.</P>
                <P>(b) The agency may determine the procedures it uses to grant prior approval of the substantive change. However, these procedures must specify an effective date, which is not retroactive, on which the change is included in the program's or institution's accreditation. An agency may designate the date of a change in ownership as the effective date of its approval of that substantive change if the accreditation decision is made within 30 days of the change in ownership. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, these procedures may, but need not, require a visit by the agency.</P>
                <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(A) of this section, if the agency's accreditation of an institution enables the institution to seek eligibility to participate in title IV, HEA programs, the agency's procedures for the approval of an additional location where at least 50 percent of an educational program is offered must provide for a determination of the institution's fiscal and administrative capacity to operate the additional location. In addition, the agency's procedures must include—</P>
                <P>(1) A visit, within six months, to each additional location the institution establishes, if the institution—</P>
                <P>(i) Has a total of three or fewer additional locations;</P>
                <P>(ii) Has not demonstrated, to the agency's satisfaction, that it has a proven record of effective educational oversight of additional locations; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Has been placed on warning, probation, or show cause by the agency or is subject to some limitation by the agency on its accreditation or preaccreditation status;</P>
                <P>(2) An effective mechanism for conducting, at reasonable intervals, visits to a representative sample of additional locations of institutions that operate more than three additional locations; and</P>

                <P>(3) An effective mechanism, which may, at the agency's discretion, include visits to additional locations, for ensuring that accredited and <PRTPAGE P="131"/>preaccredited institutions that experience rapid growth in the number of additional locations maintain educational quality.</P>
                <P>(d) The purpose of the visits described in paragraph (c) of this section is to verify that the additional location has the personnel, facilities, and resources it claimed to have in its application to the agency for approval of the additional location.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Due process.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The agency must demonstrate that the procedures it uses throughout the accrediting process satisfy due process. The agency meets this requirement if the agency does the following:</P>
                <P>(a) Provides adequate written specification of its requirements, including clear standards, for an institution or program to be accredited or preaccredited.</P>
                <P>(b) Uses procedures that afford an institution or program a reasonable period of time to comply with the agency's requests for information and documents.</P>
                <P>(c) Provides written specification of any deficiencies identified at the institution or program examined.</P>
                <P>(d) Provides sufficient opportunity for a written response by an institution or program regarding any deficiencies identified by the agency, to be considered by the agency within a timeframe determined by the agency, and before any adverse action is taken.</P>
                <P>(e) Notifies the institution or program in writing of any adverse accrediting action or an action to place the institution or program on probation or show cause. The notice describes the basis for the action.</P>

                <P>(f) Provides an opportunity, upon written request of an institution or <PRTPAGE P="134"/>program, for the institution or program to appeal any adverse action prior to the action becoming final.</P>
                <P>(1) The appeal must take place at a hearing before an appeals panel that—</P>
                <P>(i) May not include current members of the agency's decision-making body that took the initial adverse action;</P>
                <P>(ii) Is subject to a conflict of interest policy;</P>
                <P>(iii) Does not serve only an advisory or procedural role, and has and uses the authority to make the following decisions: to affirm, amend, or reverse adverse actions of the original decision-making body; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Affirms, amends, reverses, or remands the adverse action. A decision to affirm, amend, or reverse the adverse action is implemented by the appeals panel or by the original decision-making body, at the agency's option. In a decision to remand the adverse action to the original decision-making body for further consideration, the appeals panel must identify specific issues that the original decision-making body must address. In a decision that is implemented by or remanded to the original decision-making body, that body must act in a manner consistent with the appeals panel's decisions or instructions.</P>
                <P>(2) The agency must recognize the right of the institution or program to employ counsel to represent the institution or program during its appeal, including to make any presentation that the agency permits the institution or program to make on its own during the appeal.</P>
                <P>(g) The agency notifies the institution or program in writing of the result of its appeal and the basis for that result.</P>
                <P>(h)(1) The agency must provide for a process, in accordance with written procedures, through which an institution or program may, before the agency reaches a final adverse action decision, seek review of new financial information if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(i) The financial information was unavailable to the institution or program until after the decision subject to appeal was made.</P>
                <P>(ii) The financial information is significant and bears materially on the financial deficiencies identified by the agency. The criteria of significance and materiality are determined by the agency.</P>
                <P>(iii) The only remaining deficiency cited by the agency in support of a final adverse action decision is the institution's or program's failure to meet an agency standard pertaining to finances.</P>
                <P>(2) An institution or program may seek the review of new financial information described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section only once and any determination by the agency made with respect to that review does not provide a basis for an appeal.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Procedures for Department review of applications for recognition or for change in scope, compliance reports, and increases in enrollment.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) After receipt of an agency's application for initial or continued recognition, or change in scope, or an agency's compliance report, or an agency's report submitted under § 602.31(d), Department staff publishes a notice of the agency's application or report in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> inviting the public to comment on the agency's compliance with the criteria for recognition and establishing a deadline for receipt of public comment.</P>
                <P>(b) The Department staff analyzes the agency's application for initial or renewal of recognition, compliance report, or report submitted under § 602.31(d) to determine whether the agency satisfies the criteria for recognition, taking into account all available relevant information concerning the compliance of the agency with those criteria and in the agency's effectiveness in applying the criteria. The analysis of an application for recognition and, as appropriate, of a compliance report, or of a report required under § 602.31(d), includes—</P>
                <P>(1) Observations from site visit(s), on an announced or unannounced basis, to the agency or to a location where agency activities such as training, review and evaluation panel meetings, and decision meetings take place and to one or more of the institutions or programs it accredits or preaccredits;</P>
                <P>(2) Review of the public comments and other third-party information the Department staff receives by the established deadline, and the agency's responses to the third-party comments, as appropriate, as well as any other information Department staff assembles for purposes of evaluating the agency under this part; and</P>
                <P>(3) Review of complaints or legal actions involving the agency.</P>
                <P>(c) The Department staff analyzes the materials submitted in support of an application for expansion of scope to ensure that the agency has the requisite experience, policies that comply with subpart B of this part, capacity, and performance record to support the request.</P>
                <P>(d) Department staff's evaluation of an agency may also include a review of information directly related to institutions or programs accredited or preaccredited by the agency relative to their compliance with the agency's standards, the effectiveness of the standards, and the agency's application of those standards.</P>
                <P>(e) If, at any point in its evaluation of an agency seeking initial recognition, Department staff determines that the agency fails to demonstrate compliance with the basic eligibility requirements in §§ 602.10 through 602.13, the staff—</P>
                <P>(1) Returns the agency's application and provides the agency with an explanation of the deficiencies that caused staff to take that action; and</P>
                <P>(2) Recommends that the agency withdraw its application and reapply when the agency can demonstrate compliance.</P>
                <P>(f) Except with respect to an application that has been returned or is withdrawn under paragraph (e) of this section, when Department staff completes its evaluation of the agency, the staff—</P>
                <P>(1) Prepares a written draft analysis of the agency;</P>
                <P>(2) Sends the draft analysis including any identified areas of non-compliance and a proposed recognition recommendation, and all supporting documentation, including all third-party comments the Department received by the established deadline, to the agency;</P>
                <P>(3) Invites the agency to provide a written response to the draft analysis and proposed recognition recommendation and third-party comments, specifying a deadline that provides at least 30 days for the agency's response;</P>

                <P>(4) Reviews the response to the draft analysis the agency submits, if any, and prepares the written final analysis. <PRTPAGE P="139"/>The final analysis includes a recognition recommendation to the senior Department official, as the Department staff deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, a recommendation to approve, deny, limit, suspend, or terminate recognition, require the submission of a compliance report and continue recognition pending a final decision on compliance, approve or deny a request for expansion of scope, or revise or affirm the scope of the agency; and</P>
                <P>(5) Provides to the agency, no later than seven days before the Advisory Committee meeting, the final staff analysis and any other available information provided to the Advisory Committee under § 602.34(c).</P>
                <P>(g) The agency may request that the Advisory Committee defer acting on an application at that Advisory Committee meeting if Department staff fails to provide the agency with the materials described, and within the timeframes provided, in paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(5) of this section. If the Department staff's failure to send the materials in accordance with the timeframe described in paragraph (f)(3) or (f)(5) of this section is due to the failure of the agency to submit reports to the Department, other information the Secretary requested, or its response to the draft analysis, by the deadline established by the Secretary, the agency forfeits its right to request a deferral of its application.</P>

                <P>(a) The senior Department official makes a decision regarding recognition of an agency based on the record compiled under §§ 602.32, 602.33, 602.34, and 602.35 including, as applicable, the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The materials provided to the Advisory Committee under § 602.34(c).</P>

                <P>(6) A communication from the Secretary referring an issue to the senior Department official's consideration under § 602.37(e).</P>
                <P>(b) In the event that statutory authority or appropriations for the Advisory Committee ends, or there are fewer duly appointed Advisory Committee members than needed to constitute a quorum, and under extraordinary circumstances when there are serious concerns about an agency's compliance with subpart B of this part that require prompt attention, the senior Department official may make a decision in a recognition proceeding based on the record compiled under § 602.32 or § 602.33 after providing the agency with an opportunity to respond to the final staff analysis. Any decision made by the senior Department official absent a recommendation from the Advisory Committee may be appealed to the Secretary as provided in § 602.37.</P>
                <P>(c) Following consideration of an agency's recognition under this section, the senior Department official issues a recognition decision.</P>
                <P>(d) Except with respect to decisions made under paragraph (f) or (g) of this section and matters referred to the senior Department official under § 602.37(e) or (f), the senior Department official notifies the agency in writing of the senior Department official's decision regarding the agency's recognition within 90 days of the Advisory Committee meeting or conclusion of the review under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) The senior Department official's decision may include, but is not limited to, approving, denying, limiting, suspending, or terminating recognition, granting or denying an application for an expansion of scope, revising or affirming the scope of the agency, or continuing recognition pending submission and review of a compliance report under §§ 602.32 and 602.34 and review of the report by the senior Department official under this section.</P>

                <P>(1)(i) The senior Department official approves recognition if the agency complies with the criteria for recognition listed in subpart B of this part and if the agency effectively applies those criteria.<PRTPAGE P="142"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) If the senior Department official approves recognition, the recognition decision defines the scope of recognition and the recognition period. The recognition period does not exceed five years, including any time during which recognition was continued to permit submission and review of a compliance report.</P>
                <P>(iii) If the scope or period of recognition is less than that requested by the agency, the senior Department official explains the reasons for approving a lesser scope or recognition period.</P>
                <P>(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, if the agency either fails to comply with the criteria for recognition listed in subpart B of this part, or to apply those criteria effectively, the senior Department official denies, limits, suspends, or terminates recognition.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the senior Department official denies, limits, suspends, or terminates recognition, the senior Department official specifies the reasons for this decision, including all criteria the agency fails to meet and all criteria the agency has failed to apply effectively.</P>
                <P>(3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, if a recognized agency fails to demonstrate compliance with or effective application of a criterion or criteria, but the senior Department official concludes that the agency will demonstrate or achieve compliance with the criteria for recognition and effective application of those criteria within 12 months or less, the senior Department official may continue the agency's recognition, pending submission by the agency of a compliance report, review of the report under §§ 602.32 and 602.34, and review of the report by the senior Department official under this section. In such a case, the senior Department official specifies the criteria the compliance report must address, and a time period, not longer than 12 months, during which the agency must achieve compliance and effectively apply the criteria. The compliance report documenting compliance and effective application of criteria is due not later than 30 days after the end of the period specified in the senior Department official's decision.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the record includes a compliance report, and the senior Department official determines that an agency has not complied with the criteria for recognition, or has not effectively applied those criteria, during the time period specified by the senior Department official in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, the senior Department official denies, limits, suspends, or terminates recognition, except, in extraordinary circumstances, upon a showing of good cause for an extension of time as determined by the senior Department official and detailed in the senior Department official's decision. If the senior Department official determines good cause for an extension has been shown, the senior Department official specifies the length of the extension and what the agency must do during it to merit a renewal of recognition.</P>
                <P>(f) If the senior Department official determines, based on the record, that a decision to deny, limit, suspend, or terminate an agency's recognition may be warranted based on a finding that the agency is noncompliant with, or ineffective in its application of, a criterion or criteria of recognition not identified earlier in the proceedings as an area of noncompliance, the senior Department official provides—</P>
                <P>(1) The agency with an opportunity to submit a written response and documentary evidence addressing the finding; and</P>
                <P>(2) The staff with an opportunity to present its analysis in writing.</P>
                <P>(g) If relevant and material information pertaining to an agency's compliance with recognition criteria, but not contained in the record, comes to the senior Department official's attention while a decision regarding the agency's recognition is pending before the senior Department official, and if the senior Department official concludes the recognition decision should not be made without consideration of the information, the senior Department official either—</P>
                <P>(1)(i) Does not make a decision regarding recognition of the agency; and</P>

                <P>(ii) Refers the matter to Department staff for review and analysis under § 602.32 or § 602.33, as appropriate, and <PRTPAGE P="143"/>consideration by the Advisory Committee under § 602.34; or</P>
                <P>(2)(i) Provides the information to the agency and Department staff;</P>
                <P>(ii) Permits the agency to respond to the senior Department official and the Department staff in writing, and to include additional evidence relevant to the issue, and specifies a deadline;</P>
                <P>(iii) Provides Department staff with an opportunity to respond in writing to the agency's submission under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, specifying a deadline; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Issues a recognition decision based on the record described in paragraph (a) of this section, as supplemented by the information provided under this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(h) No agency may submit information to the senior Department official, or ask others to submit information on its behalf, for purposes of invoking paragraph (g) of this section. Before invoking paragraph (g) of this section, the senior Department official will take into account whether the information, if submitted by a third party, could have been submitted in accordance with § 602.32(a) or § 602.33(e)(2).</P>
                <P>(i) If the senior Department official does not reach a final decision to approve, deny, limit, suspend, or terminate an agency's recognition before the expiration of its recognition period, the senior Department official automatically extends the recognition period until a final decision is reached.</P>
                <P>(j) Unless appealed in accordance with § 602.37, the senior Department official's decision is the final decision of the Secretary.</P>

If the decision requires a compliance report, the report is due within 30 days after the end of the period specified in the Secretary's decision. The Secretary renders a final decision after taking into account the senior Department official's decision, the agency's written submissions on appeal, the senior Department official's response to the appeal, if any, and the entire record before the senior Department official. The Secretary notifies the agency in writing of the Secretary's decision regarding the agency's recognition.</P>

                <P>(e) The Secretary may determine, based on the record, that a decision to deny, limit, suspend, or terminate an agency's recognition may be warranted based on a finding that the agency is noncompliant with, or ineffective in its application with respect to, a criterion or criteria for recognition not identified as an area of noncompliance earlier in the proceedings. In that case, the Secretary, without further consideration of the appeal, refers the matter to the senior Department official for consideration of the issue under § 602.36(f). After the senior Department official makes a decision, the agency <PRTPAGE P="144"/>may, if desired, appeal that decision to the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(f) If relevant and material information pertaining to an agency's compliance with recognition criteria, but not contained in the record, comes to the Secretary's attention while a decision regarding the agency's recognition is pending before the Secretary, and if the Secretary concludes the recognition decision should not be made without consideration of the information, the Secretary either—</P>
                <P>(1)(i) Does not make a decision regarding recognition of the agency; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Refers the matter to Department staff for review and analysis under § 602.32 or § 602.33, as appropriate, and review by the Advisory Committee under § 602.34; and consideration by the senior Department official under § 602.36; or</P>
                <P>(2)(i) Provides the information to the agency and the senior Department official;</P>
                <P>(ii) Permits the agency to respond to the Secretary and the senior Department official in writing, and to include additional evidence relevant to the issue, and specifies a deadline;</P>
                <P>(iii) Provides the senior Department official with an opportunity to respond in writing to the agency's submission under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, specifying a deadline; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Issues a recognition decision based on all the materials described in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section.</P>
                <P>(g) No agency may submit information to the Secretary, or ask others to submit information on its behalf, for purposes of invoking paragraph (f) of this section. Before invoking paragraph (f) of this section, the Secretary will take into account whether the information, if submitted by a third party, could have been submitted in accordance with § 602.32(a) or § 602.33(e)(2).</P>
                <P>(h) If the Secretary does not reach a final decision on appeal to approve, deny, limit, suspend, or terminate an agency's recognition before the expiration of its recognition period, the Secretary automatically extends the recognition period until a final decision is reached.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria for State agencies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following are the criteria which the Secretary will utilize in designating a State agency as a reliable authority to assess the quality of public postsecondary vocational education in its respective State.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Functional aspects.</E> The functional aspects of the State agency must be shown by:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Its scope of operations.</E> The agency:</P>
              <P>(i) Is statewide in the scope of its operations and is legally authorized to approve public postsecondary vocational institutions or programs;</P>
              <P>(ii) Clearly sets forth the scope of its objectives and activities, both as to kinds and levels of public postsecondary vocational institutions or programs covered, and the kinds of operations performed;</P>
              <P>(iii) Delineates the process by which it differentiates among and approves programs of varying levels.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Its organization.</E> The State agency:</P>
              <P>(i) Employs qualified personnel and uses sound procedures to carry out its operations in a timely and effective manner;</P>
              <P>(ii) Receives adequate and timely financial support, as shown by its appropriations, to carry out its operations;</P>

              <P>(iii) Selects competent and knowledgeable persons, qualified by experience and training, and selects such persons in accordance with nondiscriminatory practices, (A) to participate on visiting teams, (B) to engage in consultative services for the evaluation <PRTPAGE P="146"/>and approval process, and (C) to serve on decision-making bodies.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Its procedures.</E> The State agency:</P>
              <P>(i) Maintains clear definitions of approval status and has developed written procedures for granting, reaffirming, revoking, denying, and reinstating approval status;</P>
              <P>(ii) Requires, as an integral part of the approval and reapproval process, institutional or program self-analysis and onsite reviews by visiting teams, and provides written and consultative guidance to institutions or programs and visiting teams.</P>
              <P>(A) Self-analysis shall be a qualitative assessment of the strengths and limitations of the instructional program, including the achievement of institutional or program objectives, and should involve a representative portion of the institution's administrative staff, teaching faculty, students, governing body, and other appropriate constituencies.</P>
              <P>(B) The visiting team, which includes qualified examiners other than agency staff, reviews instructional content, methods and resources, administrative management, student services, and facilities. It prepares written reports and recommendations for use by the State agency.</P>
              <P>(iii) Reevaluates at reasonable and regularly scheduled intervals institutions or programs which it has approved.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Responsibility and reliability.</E> The responsibility and reliability of the State agency will be demonstrated by:</P>
              <P>(1) Its responsiveness to the public interest. The State agency:</P>
              <P>(i) Has an advisory body which provides for representation from public employment services and employers, employees, postsecondary vocational educators, students, and the general public, including minority groups. Among its functions, this structure provides counsel to the State agency relating to the development of standards, operating procedures and policy, and interprets the educational needs and manpower projections of the State's public postsecondary vocational education system;</P>
              <P>(ii) Demonstrates that the advisory body makes a real and meaningful contribution to the approval process;</P>
              <P>(iii) Provides advance public notice of proposed or revised standards or regulations through its regular channels of communications, supplemented, if necessary, with direct communication to inform interested members of the affected community. In addition, it provides such persons the opportunity to comment on the standards or regulations prior to their adoption;</P>
              <P>(iv) Secures sufficient qualitative information regarding the applicant institution or program to enable the institution or program to demonstrate that it has an ongoing program of evaluation of outputs consistent with its educational goals;</P>
              <P>(v) Encourages experimental and innovative programs to the extent that these are conceived and implemented in a manner which ensures the quality and integrity of the institution or program;</P>
              <P>(vi) Demonstrates that it approves only those institutions or programs which meet its published standards; that its standards, policies, and procedures are fairly applied; and that its evaluations are conducted and decisions are rendered under conditions that assure an impartial and objective judgment;</P>
              <P>(vii) Regularly reviews its standards, policies and procedures in order that the evaluative process shall support constructive analysis, emphasize factors of critical importance, and reflect the educational and training needs of the student;</P>
              <P>(viii) Performs no function that would be inconsistent with the formation of an independent judgment of the quality of an educational institution or program;</P>
              <P>(ix) Has written procedures for the review of complaints pertaining to institutional or program quality as these relate to the agency's standards, and demonstrates that such procedures are adequate to provide timely treatment of such complaints in a manner fair and equitable to the complainant and to the institution or program;</P>

              <P>(x) Annually makes available to the public (A) its policies for approval, (B) reports of its operations, and (C) list of institutions or programs which it has approved;<PRTPAGE P="147"/>
              </P>
              <P>(xi) Requires each approved school or program to report on changes instituted to determine continued compliance with standards or regulations;</P>
              <P>(xii) Confers regularly with counterpart agencies that have similar responsibilities in other and neighboring States about methods and techniques that may be used to meet those responsibilities.</P>
              <P>(2) Its assurances that due process is accorded to institutions or programs seeking approval. The State agency:</P>
              <P>(i) Provides for adequate discussion during the on-site visit between the visiting team and the faculty, administrative staff, students, and other appropriate persons;</P>
              <P>(ii) Furnishes as a result of the evaluation visit, a written report to the institution or program commenting on areas of strength, areas needing improvement, and, when appropriate, suggesting means of improvement and including specific areas, if any, where the institution or program may not be in compliance with the agency's standards;</P>
              <P>(iii) Provides the chief executive officer of the institution or program with opportunity to comment upon the written report and to file supplemental materials pertinent to the facts and conclusions in the written report of the visiting team before the agency takes action on the report;</P>
              <P>(iv) Provides the chief executive officer of the institution with a specific statement of reasons for any adverse action, and notice of the right to appeal such action before an appeal body designated for that purpose;</P>
              <P>(v) Publishes rules of procedure regarding appeals;</P>
              <P>(vi) Continues the approval status of the institution or program pending disposition of an appeal;</P>
              <P>(vii) Furnishes the chief executive officer of the institution or program with a written decision of the appeal body, including a statement of its reasons therefor.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Credit-hour policies.</E> The State agency, as part of its review of an institution for initial approval or renewal of approval, must conduct an effective review and evaluation of the reliability and accuracy of the institution's assignment of credit hours.</P>
              <P>(1) The State agency meets this requirement if—</P>
              <P>(i) It reviews the institution's—</P>
              <P>(A) Policies and procedures for determining the credit hours, as defined in 34 CFR 600.2, that the institution awards for courses and programs; and</P>
              <P>(B) The application of the institution's policies and procedures to its programs and coursework; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Makes a reasonable determination of whether the institution's assignment of credit hours conforms to commonly accepted practice in higher education.</P>
              <P>(2) In reviewing and evaluating an institution's policies and procedures for determining credit hour assignments, a State agency may use sampling or other methods in the evaluation, sufficient to comply with paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The State agency must take such actions that it deems appropriate to address any deficiencies that it identifies at an institution as part of its reviews and evaluations under paragraph (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, as it does in relation to other deficiencies it may identify, subject to the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) If, following the institutional review process under this paragraph (c), the agency finds systemic noncompliance with the agency's policies or significant noncompliance regarding one or more programs at the institution, the agency must promptly notify the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Capacity to foster ethical practices.</E> The State agency must demonstrate its capability and willingness to foster ethical practices by showing that it:</P>
              <P>(i) Promotes a well-defined set of ethical standards governing institutional or programmatic practices, including recruitment, advertising, transcripts, fair and equitable student tuition refunds, and student placement services;</P>
              <P>(ii) Maintains appropriate review in relation to the ethical practices of each approved institution or program.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for the purpose of § 606.2(a)(3), an applicant institution has an enrollment of needy students if in the base year—</P>
              <P>(1) At least 50 percent of its degree students received student financial assistance under one or more of the following programs: Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Work-Study, and Federal Perkins Loan; or</P>
              <P>(2) The percentage of its undergraduate degree students who were enrolled on at least a half-time basis and received Federal Pell Grants exceeded the median percentage of undergraduate degree students who were enrolled on at least a half-time basis and received Federal Pell Grants at comparable institutions that offer similar instruction.</P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary may waive the requirement contained in paragraph (a) of this section if the institution demonstrates that—</P>
              <P>(1) The State provides more than 30 percent of the institution's budget and the institution charges not more than $99.00 for tuition and fees for an academic year;</P>
              <P>(2) At least 30 percent of the students served by the institution in the base year were students from low-income families;</P>
              <P>(3) The institution substantially increases the higher education opportunities for low-income students who are also educationally disadvantaged, underrepresented in postsecondary education, or minority students;</P>
              <P>(4) The institution substantially increases the higher education opportunities for individuals who reside in an area that is not included in a “metropolitan statistical area” as defined by the Office of Management and Budget and who are unserved by other postsecondary institutions; or</P>
              <P>(5) The institution will, if granted the waiver, substantially increase the higher education opportunities for Hispanic Americans.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purpose of paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary considers “low-income” to be an amount which does not exceed 150 percent of the amount equal to the poverty level as established by the United States Bureau of the Census.</P>

              <P>(d) Each year, the Secretary notifies prospective applicants of the low-income figures through a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

              <SUBJECT>What are low educational and general expenditures?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for the purpose of § 606.2(a)(2), an applicant institution's average educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent undergraduate student in the base year must be less than the average educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent undergraduate student in that year of comparable institutions that offer similar instruction.</P>
              <P>(2) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary determines the average educational and general expenditure per full-time equivalent undergraduate student for institutions with graduate students that do not differentiate between graduate and undergraduate educational and general expenditures by discounting the graduate enrollment using a factor of 2.5 times the number of graduate students.</P>

              <P>(b) Each year, the Secretary notifies prospective applicants through a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the average educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent undergraduate student at comparable institutions that offer similar instruction.</P>
              <P>(c) The Secretary may waive the requirement contained in paragraph (a) of this section, if the Secretary determines, based upon persuasive evidence provided by the institution, that—</P>
              <P>(1) The institution's failure to satisfy the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section was due to factors which, if used in determining compliance with those criteria, distorted that determination; and</P>
              <P>(2) The institution's designation as an eligible institution under this part is otherwise consistent with the purposes of this part.</P>

              <P>(d) For the purpose of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Secretary <PRTPAGE P="152"/>considers that the following factors may distort an institution's educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent undergraduate student—</P>
              <P>(1) Low student enrollment;</P>
              <P>(2) Location of the institution in an unusually high cost-of-living area;</P>
              <P>(3) High energy costs;</P>
              <P>(4) An increase in State funding that was part of a desegregation plan for higher education; or</P>
              <P>(5) Operation of high cost professional schools such as medical or dental schools.</P>

              <P>(1) The information necessary for the Secretary to determine whether the institution satisfies the requirements of §§ 606.2, 606.3(a), and 606.4(a);</P>

              <P>(3) Information or explanations justifying any requested waiver.</P>
              <P>(b) An institution that wishes to receive a grant under this part must submit, as part of its application for that grant, an assurance that when it submits its application—</P>
              <P>(1) Its enrollment of undergraduate full-time equivalent students is at least 25 percent Hispanic students; and</P>
              <P>(2) Not less than 50 percent of its Hispanic students are low-income individuals.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What selection criteria does the Secretary use in evaluating an application for an endowment challenge grant?</SUBJECT>
              <P>In evaluating an application for an endowment challenge grant, the Secretary uses the following three criteria:</P>
              <P>(a) The Secretary measures the applicant's past efforts to build or maintain its existing endowment and quasi-endowment funds by the dollar and relative increase in market value to the applicant's existing endowment and quasi-endowment funds over the applicant's four fiscal years preceding the year of application using the formulas set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) In measuring an applicant's dollar increase in its endowment and quasi-endowment funds, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(i) Subtracts from an amount equal to the market value of the applicant's endowment and quasi-endowment funds at the end of the four-year period described in paragraph (a) of this section an amount equal to the market value of the applicant's endowment and quasi-endowment funds at the beginning of that four-year period; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Divides the result obtained in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section by the applicant's full-time equivalent enrollment at the end of the four-year period.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary awards points on a sliding scale giving 10 points to applicants with the highest dollar increase as calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and no points to applicants with the lowest dollar increase.</P>
              <P>(3) In measuring an applicant's relative increase in market value of its endowment and quasi-endowment funds, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(i) Divides an amount equal to the market value of the applicant's endowment and quasi-endowment funds at the beginning of the four-year period described in paragraph (a) of this section by the applicant's full-time equivalent enrollment at the end of the four-year period.</P>
              <P>(ii) Adds $50 to the amount obtained in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) Divides the result obtained in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section by the amount obtained in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) If the amount of endowment per full-time equivalent student under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is $50 or more, the Secretary awards points on a sliding scale giving 15 points to applicants with a relative increase of 100 percent or more and no points to applicants that have had a relative decrease of more than 20 percent.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the amount of endowment per full-time equivalent student under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is less than $50, the Secretary awards points on a sliding scale giving 15 points to applicants with a relative increase of 100 percent or more and no points to applicants that have had no relative increase.</P>
              <P>(5) In measuring the applicant's past effort, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(i) Excludes real estate from being considered as part of the applicant's existing endowment or quasi-endowment fund; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Includes an endowment or quasi-endowment fund operated by a foundation if the foundation is tax-exempt and was established for the purpose of raising money for the institution.</P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary considers the degree of proposed nongovernmental matching funds. (Total: 15 points maximum for the highest proposed percentage)</P>
              <P>(1) The Secretary measures the degree to which an applicant proposes to match the grant with funds from sources other than a State or local government—giving up to 15 points to applicants proposing to obtain the largest percentage of matching funds from those nongovernmental sources.</P>
              <P>(2) If an applicant is applying for an endowment challenge grant for the first time, the Secretary multiplies the maximum number of points (i.e., 15 points) on this criterion times the following fraction:</P>
              <GPH DEEP="35" SPAN="1">
                <PRTPAGE P="191"/>
                <GID>EC15NO91.021</GID>
              </GPH>
              <P>(3) If an applicant has previously received an endowment challenge grant, the Secretary uses the following formula in awarding points under this criterion:</P>
              <GPH DEEP="106" SPAN="2">
                <GID>EC15NO91.022</GID>
              </GPH>
              <P>(c) The Secretary considers the need for an endowment challenge grant as measured by the applicant's lack of resources.</P>
              <P>(1) The Secretary gives up to 50 points to applicants with the least resources as measured, at the end of the applicant's fiscal year preceding the year it applies for an endowment challenge grant, by revenue per full-time equivalent student it receives from the sum of the following—</P>
              <P>(i) Federal, State and local government appropriations;</P>
              <P>(ii) Unrestricted Federal, State and local government grants and contracts;</P>
              <P>(iii) Eighty percent of tuition and fees; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Unrestricted and restricted “endowment income”.</P>
              <P>(2) In measuring the applicant's resources, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(i) Defines the factors in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) as they are defined in the Education Department Higher Education General Information Survey of Financial Statistics.</P>
              <P>(ii) Excludes real estate from being considered as part of the applicant's existing endowment or quasi-endowment fund.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Need for an endowment challenge grant as measured by the lack of endowment funds.</E> (Total: 20 points)</P>

              <P>(2) After the competition, the Secretary makes new awards in rank order as described in § 642.20 based on the available funds for the competition minus the funds set aside for the second review.</P>
              <P>(3) After the Secretary issues a notification of grant award to successful applicants, the Secretary notifies each unsuccessful applicant in writing as to the status of its application and the funding band for the second review and provides copies of the peer reviewers' evaluations of the applicant's application and the applicant's PE score, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) An applicant that was not selected for funding following the competition as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and whose application received a score within the funding band as described in paragraph (d) of this section, may request a second review if the applicant demonstrates that the Department, the Department's agent, or a peer reviewer made an administrative or scoring error as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) An applicant whose application was not funded after the first review as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and whose application received a score within the funding band as described in paragraph (d) of this section has at least 15 calendar days after receiving notification that its application was not funded in which to submit a written request for a second review in accordance with the instructions and due date provided in the Secretary's written notification.</P>
              <P>(6) An applicant's written request for a second review must be received by the Department or submitted electronically to a designated e-mail or Web address by the due date and time established by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(7) If the Secretary determines that the Department or the Department's agent made an administrative error that relates to the PE points awarded, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the Secretary adjusts the applicant's PE score to reflect the correct number of PE points. If the adjusted score assigned to the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) If the Secretary determines that the Department, the Department's agent or the peer reviewer made an administrative error that relates to the peer reviewers' score(s), as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the Secretary adjusts the applicant's peer reviewers' score(s) to correct the error. If the adjusted score assigned to the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) If the Secretary determines that a peer reviewer made a scoring error, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Secretary convenes a second panel of peer reviewers in accordance with the requirements in section 402A(c)(8)(C)(iv)(III) of the HEA.</P>
              <P>(10) The average of the peer reviewers' scores from the second peer review are used in the second ranking of applications. The average score obtained from the second peer review panel is the final peer reviewer score for the application and will be used even if the second review results in a lower score for the application than that obtained in the initial review.</P>
              <P>(11) For applications in the funding band, the Secretary funds these applications in rank order based on adjusted scores and the available funds that have been set aside for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Process for establishing a funding band.</E> (1) For each competition, the Secretary establishes a funding band for the second review of applications.</P>

              <P>(2) The Secretary establishes the funding band for each competition <PRTPAGE P="208"/>based on the amount of funds the Secretary has set aside for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(3) The funding band is composed of those applications—</P>
              <P>(i) With a rank-order score before the second review that is below the lowest score of applications funded after the first review; and</P>
              <P>(ii) That would be funded if the Secretary had 150 percent of the funds that were set aside for the second review of applications for the competition.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Final decision.</E> (1) The Secretary's determination of whether the applicant has met the requirements for a second review and the Secretary's decision on re-scoring of an application are final and not subject to further appeal or challenge.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the total score assigned the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative or scoring error for applications that were reviewed.</E> (1) An applicant that was not selected for funding during a competition may request that the Secretary conduct a second review of the application if—</P>
              <P>(i) The applicant provides evidence demonstrating that the Department, an agent of the Department, or a peer reviewer made an administrative or scoring error in the review of its application; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The final score assigned to the application is within the funding band described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) An administrative error relates to either the PE points or the scores assigned to the application by the peer reviewers.</P>
              <P>(i) For PE points, an administrative error includes mathematical errors made by the Department or the Department's agent in the calculation of the PE points or a failure to correctly add the earned PE points to the peer reviewer score.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the peer review score, an administrative error is applying the wrong peer reviewer scores to an application.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) A scoring error relates only to the peer review process and includes errors caused by a reviewer who, in assigning points—</P>

              <P>(A) Uses criteria not required by the applicable law or program regulations, the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications, the other published application materials for the competition, or guidance provided to the peer reviewers by the Secretary; or</P>
              <P>(B) Does not consider relevant information included in the appropriate section of the application.</P>
              <P>(ii) The term “scoring error” does not include—</P>
              <P>(A) A peer reviewer's appropriate use of his or her professional judgment in evaluating and scoring an application;</P>

              <P>(B) Any situation in which the applicant did not include information needed to evaluate its response to a specific selection criterion in the appropriate section of the application as stipulated in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications or the other published application materials for the competition; or</P>
              <P>(C) Any error by the applicant.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures for the second review.</E> (1) To ensure the timely awarding of grants under the competition, the Secretary sets aside a percentage of the funds allotted for the competition to be awarded after the second review is completed.</P>
              <P>(2) After the competition, the Secretary makes new awards in rank order as described in § 643.20 based on the available funds for the competition minus the funds set aside for the second review.</P>
              <P>(3) After the Secretary issues a notification of grant award to successful applicants, the Secretary notifies each unsuccessful applicant in writing as to the status of its application and the funding band for the second review and provides copies of the peer reviewers' evaluations of the applicant's application and the applicant's PE score, if applicable.</P>

              <P>(4) An applicant that was not selected for funding following the competition as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and whose application received a score within the funding band as described in paragraph (d) of this section, may request a second review if the applicant demonstrates that the Department, the Department's <PRTPAGE P="218"/>agent, or a peer reviewer made an administrative or scoring error as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) An applicant whose application was not funded after the first review as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and whose application received a score within the funding band as described in paragraph (d) of this section has at least 15 calendar days after receiving notification that its application was not funded in which to submit a written request for a second review in accordance with the instructions and due date provided in the Secretary's written notification.</P>
              <P>(6) An applicant's written request for a second review must be received by the Department or submitted electronically to the designated e-mail or Web address by the due date and time established by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(7) If the Secretary determines that the Department or the Department's agent made an administrative error that relates to the PE points awarded, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the Secretary adjusts the applicant's PE score to reflect the correct number of PE points. If the adjusted score assigned to the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) If the Secretary determines that the Department, the Department's agent or the peer reviewer made an administrative error that relates to the peer reviewers' score(s), as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the Secretary adjusts the applicant's peer reviewers' score(s) to correct the error. If the adjusted score assigned to the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) If the Secretary determines that a peer reviewer made a scoring error, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Secretary convenes a second panel of peer reviewers in accordance with the requirements in section 402A(c)(8)(C)(iv)(III) of the HEA.</P>
              <P>(10) The average of the peer reviewers' scores from the second peer review are used in the second ranking of applications. The average score obtained from the second peer review panel is the final peer reviewer score for the application and will be used even if the second review results in a lower score for the application than that obtained in the initial review.</P>
              <P>(11) For applications in the funding band, the Secretary funds these applications in rank order based on adjusted scores and the available funds that have been set aside for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Process for establishing a funding band.</E> (1) For each competition, the Secretary establishes a funding band for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary establishes the funding band for each competition based on the amount of funds the Secretary has set aside for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(3) The funding band is composed of those applications—</P>
              <P>(i) With a rank-order score before the second review that is below the lowest score of applications funded after the first review; and</P>
              <P>(ii) That would be funded if the Secretary had 150 percent of the funds that were set aside for the second review of applications for the competition.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Final decision.</E> (1) The Secretary's determination of whether the applicant has met the requirements for a second review and the Secretary's decision on re-scoring of an application are final and not subject to further appeal or challenge.</P>
              <P>(2) An application that scored below the established funding band for the competition is not eligible for a second review.</P>

              <P>(a) In the case of an application described in § 644.20(a)(2)(i), the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(1) Evaluates the applicant's performance under its expiring Educational Opportunity Centers project;</P>
              <P>(2) Uses the approved project objectives for the applicant's expiring Educational Opportunity Centers grant and the information the applicant submitted in its annual performance reports (APRs) to determine the number of PE points; and</P>
              <P>(3) May adjust a calculated PE score or decide not to award PE points if other information such as audit reports, site visit reports, and project evaluation reports indicates the APR data used to calculate PE points are incorrect.</P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary does not award PE points for a given year to an applicant that does not serve at least 90 percent of the approved number of participants. For purposes of this section, the approved number of participants is the total number of participants the project would serve as agreed upon by the grantee and the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(c) The Secretary does not award PE points for the criterion specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (Number of participants) if the applicant did not serve at least the approved number of participants.</P>
              <P>(d) For purposes of the PE evaluation of grants awarded after January 1, 2009, the Secretary evaluates the applicant's PE on the basis of the following outcome criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) (3 points) <E T="03">Number of participants.</E> Whether the applicant provided services to no less than the approved number of participants.</P>
              <P>(2) (3 points) <E T="03">Secondary school diploma.</E> Whether the applicant met or exceeded its approved objective with regard to participants served during the project year who do not have a secondary school diploma or its equivalent who receive a secondary school diploma or its equivalent within the time period specified in the approved objective.</P>
              <P>(3) (5 points) <E T="03">Postsecondary enrollment.</E> Whether the applicant met or exceeded its approved objective with regard to the secondary school graduates served during the project year who enroll in programs of postsecondary education within the time period specified in the approved objective.</P>
              <P>(4) (2 points) <E T="03">Financial aid applications.</E> Whether the applicant met or exceeded its objective regarding participants applying for financial aid.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Technical or administrative error for applications not reviewed.</E> (1) An applicant whose grant application was not evaluated during the competition may request that the Secretary review the application if—</P>

              <P>(i) The applicant has met all of the application submission requirements <PRTPAGE P="227"/>included in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications and the other published application materials for the competition; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The applicant provides evidence demonstrating that the Department or an agent of the Department made a technical or administrative error in the processing of the submitted application.</P>
              <P>(2) A technical or administrative error in the processing of an application includes—</P>

              <P>(i) A problem with the system for the electronic submission of applications that was not addressed in accordance with the procedures included in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications for the competition;</P>
              <P>(ii) An error in determining an applicant's eligibility for funding consideration, which may include, but is not limited to—</P>
              <P>(A) An incorrect conclusion that the application was submitted by an ineligible applicant;</P>
              <P>(B) An incorrect conclusion that the application exceeded the published page limit;</P>
              <P>(C) An incorrect conclusion that the applicant requested funding greater than the published maximum award; or</P>
              <P>(D) An incorrect conclusion that the application was missing critical sections of the application; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any other mishandling of the application that resulted in an otherwise eligible application not being reviewed during the competition.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) If the Secretary determines that the Department or the Department's agent made a technical or administrative error, the Secretary has the application evaluated and scored.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the total score assigned the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative or scoring error for applications that were reviewed.</E> (1) An applicant that was not selected for funding during a competition may request that the Secretary conduct a second review of the application if—</P>
              <P>(i) The applicant provides evidence demonstrating that the Department, an agent of the Department, or a peer reviewer made an administrative or scoring error in the review of its application; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The final score assigned to the application is within the funding band described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) An administrative error relates to either the PE points or the scores assigned to the application by the peer reviewers.</P>
              <P>(i) For PE points, an administrative error includes mathematical errors made by the Department or the Department's agent in the calculation of the PE points or a failure to correctly add the earned PE points to the peer reviewer score.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the peer review score, an administrative error is applying the wrong peer reviewer scores to an application.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) A scoring error relates only to the peer review process and includes errors caused by a reviewer who, in assigning points—</P>

              <P>(A) Uses criteria not required by the applicable law or program regulations, the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications, the other published application materials for the competition, or guidance provided to the peer reviewers by the Secretary; or</P>
              <P>(B) Does not consider relevant information included in the appropriate section of the application.</P>
              <P>(ii) The term “scoring error” does not include—</P>
              <P>(A) A peer reviewer's appropriate use of his or her professional judgment in evaluating and scoring an application;</P>

              <P>(B) Any situation in which the applicant did not include information needed to evaluate its response to a specific selection criterion in the appropriate section of the application as stipulated in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications or the other published application materials for the competition; or</P>
              <P>(C) Any error by the applicant.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures for the second review.</E> (1) To ensure the timely awarding of grants under the competition, the Secretary sets aside a percentage of the funds allotted for the competition to be <PRTPAGE P="228"/>awarded after the second review is completed.</P>
              <P>(2) After the competition, the Secretary makes new awards in rank order as described in § 644.20 based on the available funds for the competition minus the funds set aside for the second review.</P>
              <P>(3) After the Secretary issues a notification of grant award to successful applicants, the Secretary notifies each unsuccessful applicant in writing as to the status of its application and the funding band for the second review and provides copies of the peer reviewers' evaluations of the applicant's application and the applicant's PE score, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) An applicant that was not selected for funding following the competition as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and whose application received a score within the funding band as described in paragraph (d) of this section, may request a second review if the applicant demonstrates that the Department, the Department's agent, or a peer reviewer made an administrative or scoring error as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) An applicant whose application was not funded after the first review as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and whose application received a score within the funding band as described in paragraph (d) of this section has at least 15 calendar days after receiving notification that its application was not funded in which to submit a written request for a second review in accordance with the instructions and due date provided in the Secretary's written notification.</P>
              <P>(6) An applicant's written request for a second review must be received by the Department or submitted electronically to the designated e-mail or Web address by the due date and time established by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(7) If the Secretary determines that the Department or the Department's agent made an administrative error that relates to the PE points awarded, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the Secretary adjusts the applicant's PE score to reflect the correct number of PE points. If the adjusted score assigned to the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) If the Secretary determines that the Department, the Department's agent or the peer reviewer made an administrative error that relates to the peer reviewers' score(s), as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the Secretary adjusts the applicant's peer reviewers' score(s) to correct the error. If the adjusted score assigned to the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) If the Secretary determines that a peer reviewer made a scoring error, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Secretary convenes a second panel of peer reviewers in accordance with the requirements in section 402A(c)(8)(C)(iv)(III) of the HEA.</P>
              <P>(10) The average of the peer reviewers' scores from the second peer review are used in the second ranking of applications. The average score obtained from the second peer review panel is the final peer reviewer score for the application and will be used even if the second review results in a lower score for the application than that obtained in the initial review.</P>
              <P>(11) For applications in the funding band, the Secretary funds these applications in rank order based on adjusted scores and the available funds that have been set aside for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Process for establishing a funding band.</E> (1) For each competition, the Secretary establishes a funding band for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary establishes the funding band for each competition based on the amount of funds the Secretary has set aside for the second review of applications.</P>

              <P>(3) The funding band is composed of those applications—<PRTPAGE P="229"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) With a rank-order score before the second review that is below the lowest score of applications funded after the first review; and</P>
              <P>(ii) That would be funded if the Secretary had 150 percent of the funds that were set aside for the second review of applications for the competition.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Final decision.</E> (1) The Secretary's determination of whether the applicant has met the requirements for a second review and the Secretary's decision on re-scoring of an application are final and not subject to further appeal or challenge.</P>
              <P>(2) An application that scored below the established funding band for the competition is not eligible for a second review.</P>

              <P>The Secretary uses the following criteria to evaluate an application for a grant:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Need for the project</E> (24 points). In determining need for an Upward Bound project, the Secretary reviews each type of project (Regular, Math and Science, or Veterans) using different need criteria. The criteria for each type of project contain the same maximum score of 24 points and read as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The Secretary evaluates the need for a Regular Upward Bound project in the proposed target area on the basis of information contained in the application which clearly demonstrates that—</P>

              <P>(i) A problem with the system for the electronic submission of applications that was not addressed in accordance with the procedures included in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications for the competition;</P>
              <P>(ii) An error in determining an applicant's eligibility for funding consideration, which may include, but is not limited to—</P>
              <P>(A) An incorrect conclusion that the application was submitted by an ineligible applicant;</P>
              <P>(B) An incorrect conclusion that the application exceeded the published page limit;</P>

              <P>(D) An incorrect conclusion that the application was missing critical sections of the application; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any other mishandling of the application that resulted in an otherwise eligible application not being reviewed during the competition.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) If the Secretary determines that the Department or the Department's agent made a technical or administrative error, the Secretary has the application evaluated and scored.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the total score assigned the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative or scoring error for applications that were reviewed.</E> (1) An applicant that was not selected for funding during a competition may request that the Secretary conduct a second review of the application if—</P>
              <P>(i) The applicant provides evidence demonstrating that the Department, an agent of the Department, or a peer reviewer made an administrative or scoring error in the review of its application; and</P>

              <P>(2) An administrative error relates to either the PE points or the scores assigned to the application by the peer reviewers.</P>
              <P>(i) For PE points, an administrative error includes mathematical errors made by the Department or the Department's agent in the calculation of the PE points or a failure to correctly add the earned PE points to the peer reviewer score.</P>

              <P>(B) Does not consider relevant information included in the appropriate section of the application.</P>
              <P>(ii) The term “scoring error” does not include—</P>
              <P>(A) A peer reviewer's appropriate use of his or her professional judgment in evaluating and scoring an application;</P>

              <P>(B) Any situation in which the applicant did not include information needed to evaluate its response to a specific selection criterion in the appropriate section of the application as stipulated in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications or the other published application materials for the competition; or</P>

              <P>(2) After the competition, the Secretary makes new awards in rank order as described in § 645.30 based on the available funds for the competition minus the funds set aside for the second review.</P>
              <P>(3) After the Secretary issues a notification of grant award to successful applicants, the Secretary notifies each unsuccessful applicant in writing as to the status of its application and the funding band for the second review and provides copies of the peer reviewers' evaluations of the applicant's application and the applicant's PE score, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) An applicant that was not selected for funding following the competition as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and whose application received a score within the funding band as described in paragraph (d) of this section, may request a second review if the applicant demonstrates that the Department, the Department's agent, or a peer reviewer made an administrative or scoring error as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) An applicant whose application was not funded after the first review as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and whose application received a score within the funding band as described in paragraph (d) of this section has at least 15 calendar days after receiving notification that its application was not funded in which to submit a written request for a second review in accordance with the instructions and due date provided in the Secretary's written notification.</P>
              <P>(6) An applicant's written request for a second review must be received by the Department or submitted electronically to the designated e-mail or Web address by the due date and time established by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(7) If the Secretary determines that the Department or the Department's agent made an administrative error that relates to the PE points awarded, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the Secretary adjusts the applicant's PE score to reflect the correct number of PE points. If the adjusted score assigned to the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</P>

              <P>(8) If the Secretary determines that the Department, the Department's agent or the peer reviewer made an administrative error that relates to the peer reviewers' score(s), as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the Secretary adjusts the applicant's peer reviewers' score(s) to correct the error. If the adjusted score assigned to the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="244"/>
              </P>
              <P>(9) If the Secretary determines that a peer reviewer made a scoring error, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Secretary convenes a second panel of peer reviewers in accordance with the requirements in section 402A(c)(8)(C)(iv)(III) of the HEA.</P>
              <P>(10) The average of the peer reviewers' scores from the second peer review are used in the second ranking of applications. The average score obtained from the second peer review panel is the final peer reviewer score for the application and will be used even if the second review results in a lower score for the application than that obtained in the initial review.</P>
              <P>(11) For applications in the funding band, the Secretary funds these applications in rank order based on adjusted scores and the available funds that have been set aside for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Process for establishing a funding band.</E> (1) For each competition, the Secretary establishes a funding band for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary establishes the funding band for each competition based on the amount of funds the Secretary has set aside for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(3) The funding band is composed of those applications—</P>
              <P>(i) With a rank-order score before the second review that is below the lowest score of applications funded after the first review; and</P>
              <P>(ii) That would be funded if the Secretary had 150 percent of the funds that were set aside for the second review of applications for the competition.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Final decision.</E> (1) The Secretary's determination of whether the applicant has met the requirements for a second review and the Secretary's decision on re-scoring of an application are final and not subject to further appeal or challenge.</P>

              <P>(ii) The term “scoring error” does not include—</P>
              <P>(A) A peer reviewer's appropriate use of his or her professional judgment in evaluating and scoring an application;</P>

              <P>(B) Any situation in which the applicant did not include information needed to evaluate its response to a specific selection criterion in the appropriate section of the application as stipulated in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications or the other published application materials for the competition; or</P>
              <P>(C) Any error by the applicant.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures for the second review.</E> (1) To ensure the timely awarding of grants under the competition, the Secretary sets aside a percentage of the funds allotted for the competition to be awarded after the second review is completed.</P>
              <P>(2) After the competition, the Secretary makes new awards in rank order as described in § 646.20 based on the available funds for the competition minus the funds set aside for the second review.</P>

              <P>(3) After the Secretary issues a notification of grant award to successful applicants, the Secretary notifies each unsuccessful applicant in writing as to the status of its application and the funding band for the second review and provides copies of the peer reviewers' evaluations of the applicant's application and the applicant's PE score, if applicable.<PRTPAGE P="255"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) An applicant that was not selected for funding following the competition as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and whose application received a score within the funding band as described in paragraph (d) of this section, may request a second review if the applicant demonstrates that the Department, the Department's agent, or a peer reviewer made an administrative or scoring error as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) An applicant whose application was not funded after the first review as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and whose application received a score within the funding band as described in paragraph (d) of this section has at least 15 calendar days after receiving notification that its application was not funded in which to submit a written request for a second review in accordance with the instructions and due date provided in the Secretary's written notification.</P>
              <P>(6) An applicant's written request for a second review must be received by the Department or submitted electronically to the designated e-mail or Web address by the due date and time established by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(7) If the Secretary determines that the Department or the Department's agent made an administrative error that relates to the PE points awarded, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the Secretary adjusts the applicant's PE score to reflect the correct number of PE points. If the adjusted score assigned to the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) If the Secretary determines that the Department, the Department's agent or the peer reviewer made an administrative error that relates to the peer reviewers' score(s), as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the Secretary adjusts the applicant's peer reviewers' score(s) to correct the error. If the adjusted score assigned to the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) If the Secretary determines that a peer reviewer made a scoring error, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Secretary convenes a second panel of peer reviewers in accordance with the requirements in section 402A(c)(8)(C)(iv)(III) of the HEA.</P>
              <P>(10) The average of the peer reviewers' scores from the second peer review are used in the second ranking of applications. The average score obtained from the second peer review panel is the final peer reviewer score for the application and will be used even if the second review results in a lower score for the application than that obtained in the initial review.</P>
              <P>(11) For applications in the funding band, the Secretary funds these applications in rank order based on adjusted scores and the available funds that have been set aside for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Process for establishing a funding band.</E> (1) For each competition, the Secretary establishes a funding band for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary establishes the funding band for each competition based on the amount of funds the Secretary has set aside for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(3) The funding band is composed of those applications—</P>
              <P>(i) With a rank-order score before the second review that is below the lowest score of applications funded after the first review; and</P>
              <P>(ii) That would be funded if the Secretary had 150 percent of the funds that were set aside for the second review of applications for the competition.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Final decision.</E> (1) The Secretary's determination of whether the applicant has met the requirements for a second review and the Secretary's decision on re-scoring of an application are final and not subject to further appeal or challenge.</P>

              <P>(2) An application that scored below the established funding band for the <PRTPAGE P="256"/>competition is not eligible for a second review.</P>

              <P>(ii) The maximum score for all the criteria in § 647.21 is 100 points. The maximum score for each criterion is indicated in parentheses with the criterion.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) For an application from an applicant who has carried out a McNair project in the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the applicant is applying, the Secretary evaluates the applicant's prior experience of high quality service delivery on the basis of the outcome criteria in § 647.22.</P>
              <P>(ii) The maximum total score for all the criteria in § 647.22 is 15 points. The maximum score for each criterion is indicated in parentheses with the criterion.</P>
              <P>(iii) If an applicant described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section applies for more than one new grant in the same fiscal year, the Secretary applies the criteria in § 647.22 to a project that seeks to continue support for an existing McNair project on that campus.</P>

              <P>(iv) The Secretary evaluates the PE of an applicant for each of the three project years that the Secretary designates in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications and the other published application materials for the competition.</P>

              <P>The Secretary uses the following criteria to evaluate an application for a new grant:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Need</E> (16 Points). The Secretary reviews each application to determine the extent to which the applicant can clearly and definitively demonstrate the need for a McNair project to serve the target population. In particular, the Secretary looks for information that clearly defines the target population; describes the academic, financial and other problems that prevent potentially eligible project participants in the target population from completing baccalaureate programs and continuing to postbaccalaureate programs; and demonstrates that the project's target population is underrepresented in graduate education, doctorate degrees conferred and careers where a doctorate is a prerequisite.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Objectives</E> (9 points). The Secretary evaluates the quality of the applicant's objectives and proposed targets (percentages) in the following areas on the basis of the extent to which they are both ambitious, as related to the need data provided under paragraph (a) of this section, and attainable, given the project's plan of operation, budget, and other resources:</P>
              <P>(1) (2 points) Research or scholarly activity.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Plan of Operation</E> (44 points). The Secretary reviews each application to determine the quality of the applicant's plans of operation, including—</P>
              <P>(1) (4 points) The plan for identifying, recruiting and selecting participants to be served by the project, including students enrolled in the Student Support Services program;</P>
              <P>(2) (4 points) The plan for assessing individual participant needs and for monitoring the academic growth of participants during the period in which the student is a McNair participant;</P>
              <P>(3) (5 points) The plan for providing high quality research and scholarly activities in which participants will be involved;</P>
              <P>(4) (5 points) The plan for involving faculty members in the design of research activities in which students will be involved;</P>
              <P>(5) (5 points) The plan for providing internships, seminars, and other educational activities designed to prepare undergraduate students for doctoral study;</P>
              <P>(6) (5 points) The plan for providing individual or group services designed to enhance a student's successful entry into postbaccalaureate education;</P>
              <P>(7) (3 points) The plan to inform the institutional community of the goals and objectives of the project;</P>
              <P>(8) (8 points) The plan to ensure proper and efficient administration of the project, including, but not limited to matters such as financial management, student records management, personnel management, the organizational structure, and the plan for coordinating the McNair project with other programs for disadvantaged students; and</P>
              <P>(9) (5 points) The follow-up plan that will be used to track the academic and career accomplishments of participants after they are no longer participating in the McNair project.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Quality of key personnel</E> (9 points). The Secretary evaluates the quality of <PRTPAGE P="263"/>key personnel the applicant plans to use on the project on the basis of the following:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) The job qualifications of the project director.</P>
              <P>(ii) The job qualifications of each of the project's other key personnel.</P>
              <P>(iii) The quality of the project's plan for employing highly qualified persons, including the procedures to be used to employ members of groups underrepresented in higher education, including Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (including Native Hawaiians).</P>
              <P>(2) In evaluating the qualifications of a person, the Secretary considers his or her experience and training in fields related to the objectives of the project.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Adequacy of the resources and budget</E> (15 points). The Secretary evaluates the extent to which—</P>
              <P>(1) The applicant's proposed allocation of resources in the budget is clearly related to the objectives of the project;</P>
              <P>(2) Project costs and resources, including facilities, equipment, and supplies, are reasonable in relation to the objectives and scope of the project; and</P>
              <P>(3) The applicant's proposed commitment of institutional resources to the McNair participants, as for example, the commitment of time from institutional research faculty and the waiver of tuition and fees for McNair participants engaged in summer research projects.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Evaluation plan</E> (7 points). The Secretary evaluates the quality of the evaluation plan for the project on the basis of the extent to which the applicant's methods of evaluation—</P>
              <P>(1) Are appropriate to the project's objectives;</P>
              <P>(2) Provide for the applicant to determine, in specific and measurable ways, the success of the project in—</P>
              <P>(i) Making progress toward achieving its objectives (a formative evaluation); and</P>
              <P>(ii) Achieving its objectives at the end of the project period (a summative evaluation); and</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Technical or administrative error for applications not reviewed.</E> (1) An applicant whose grant application was not evaluated during the competition may request that the Secretary review the application if—</P>

              <P>(i) The applicant has met all of the application submission requirements included in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications and the other published application materials for the competition; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The applicant provides evidence demonstrating that the Department or an agent of the Department made a technical or administrative error in the processing of the submitted application.</P>
              <P>(2) A technical or administrative error in the processing of an application includes—</P>

              <P>(i) A problem with the system for the electronic submission of applications that was not addressed in accordance with the procedures included in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications for the competition;</P>
              <P>(ii) An error in determining an applicant's eligibility for funding consideration, which may include, but is not limited to—</P>
              <P>(A) An incorrect conclusion that the application was submitted by an ineligible applicant;</P>
              <P>(B) An incorrect conclusion that the application exceeded the published page limit;</P>
              <P>(C) An incorrect conclusion that the applicant requested funding greater than the published maximum award; or</P>
              <P>(D) An incorrect conclusion that the application was missing critical sections of the application; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any other mishandling of the application that resulted in an otherwise eligible application not being reviewed during the competition.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) If the Secretary determines that the Department or the Department's agent made a technical or administrative error, the Secretary has the application evaluated and scored.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the total score assigned the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds <PRTPAGE P="265"/>available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative or scoring error for applications that were reviewed.</E> (1) An applicant that was not selected for funding during a competition may request that the Secretary conduct a second review of the application if—</P>
              <P>(i) The applicant provides evidence demonstrating that the Department, an agent of the Department, or a peer reviewer made an administrative or scoring error in the review of its application; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The final score assigned to the application is within the funding band described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) An administrative error relates to either the PE points or the scores assigned to the application by the peer reviewers.</P>
              <P>(i) For PE points, an administrative error includes mathematical errors made by the Department or the Department's agent in the calculation of the PE points or a failure to correctly add the earned PE points to the peer reviewer score.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the peer review score, an administrative error is applying the wrong peer reviewer scores to an application.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) A scoring error relates only to the peer review process and includes errors caused by a reviewer who, in assigning points—</P>

              <P>(A) Uses criteria not required by the applicable law or program regulations, the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications, the other published application materials for the competition, or guidance provided to the peer reviewers by the Secretary; or</P>
              <P>(B) Does not consider relevant information included in the appropriate section of the application.</P>
              <P>(ii) The term “scoring error” does not include—</P>
              <P>(A) A peer reviewer's appropriate use of his or her professional judgment in evaluating and scoring an application;</P>

              <P>(B) Any situation in which the applicant did not include information needed to evaluate its response to a specific selection criterion in the appropriate section of the application as stipulated in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice inviting applications or the other published application materials for the competition; or</P>
              <P>(C) Any error by the applicant.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures for the second review.</E> (1) To ensure the timely awarding of grants under the competition, the Secretary sets aside a percentage of the funds allotted for the competition to be awarded after the second review is completed.</P>
              <P>(2) After the competition, the Secretary makes new awards in rank order as described in § 647.20 based on the available funds for the competition minus the funds set aside for the second review.</P>
              <P>(3) After the Secretary issues a notification of grant award to successful applicants, the Secretary notifies each unsuccessful applicant in writing as to the status of its application and the funding band for the second review and provides copies of the peer reviewers' evaluations of the applicant's application and the applicant's PE score, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) An applicant that was not selected for funding following the competition as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and whose application received a score within the funding band as described in paragraph (d) of this section, may request a second review if the applicant demonstrates that the Department, the Department's agent, or a peer reviewer made an administrative or scoring error as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) An applicant whose application was not funded after the first review as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and whose application received a score within the funding band as described in paragraph (d) of this section has at least 15 calendar days after receiving notification that its application was not funded in which to submit a written request for a second review in accordance with the instructions and due date provided in the Secretary's written notification.</P>

              <P>(6) An applicant's written request for a second review must be received by the Department or submitted electronically to a designated e-mail or <PRTPAGE P="266"/>Web address by the due date and time established by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(7) If the Secretary determines that the Department or the Department's agent made an administrative error that relates to the PE points awarded, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the Secretary adjusts the applicant's PE score to reflect the correct number of PE points. If the adjusted score assigned to the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) If the Secretary determines that the Department, the Department's agent or the peer reviewer made an administrative error that relates to the peer reviewers' score(s), as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the Secretary adjusts the applicant's peer reviewers' score(s) to correct the error. If the adjusted score assigned to the application would have resulted in funding of the application during the competition and the program has funds available, the Secretary funds the application prior to the re-ranking of applications based on the second peer review of applications described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) If the Secretary determines that a peer reviewer made a scoring error, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Secretary convenes a second panel of peer reviewers in accordance with the requirements in section 402A(c)(8)(C)(iv)(III) of the HEA.</P>
              <P>(10) The average of the peer reviewers' scores from the second peer review are used in the second ranking of applications. The average score obtained from the second peer review panel is the final peer reviewer score for the application and will be used even if the second review results in a lower score for the application than that obtained in the initial review.</P>
              <P>(11) For applications in the funding band, the Secretary funds these applications in rank order based on adjusted scores and the available funds that have been set aside for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Process for establishing a funding band.</E> (1) For each competition, the Secretary establishes a funding band for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary establishes the funding band for each competition based on the amount of funds the Secretary has set aside for the second review of applications.</P>
              <P>(3) The funding band is composed of those applications—</P>
              <P>(i) With a rank-order score before the second review that is below the lowest score of applications funded after the first review; and</P>
              <P>(ii) That would be funded if the Secretary had 150 percent of the funds that were set aside for the second review of applications for the competition.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Final decision.</E> (1) The Secretary's determination of whether the applicant has met the requirements for a second review and the Secretary's decision on re-scoring of an application are final and not subject to further appeal or challenge.</P>
              <P>(2) An application that scored below the established funding band for the competition is not eligible for a second review.</P>

              <P>The Secretary may give an absolute preference to any of the academic areas listed as disciplines or subdisciplines below, or the resulting inter-disciplines. The list was derived from the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) developed by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement of the U.S. Department of Education and includes the instructional programs that may constitute courses of studies toward graduate degrees. The code number to the left of each discipline and subdiscipline is the Department's identification code for that particular type of instructional program.

              <P>(1) Is selected in accordance with the criteria established under § 654.41; and</P>
              <P>(2) Meets the requirements for continuing eligibility under § 654.51.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The SEA shall ensure that the total amount of financial aid awarded to a scholar for a year of study does not exceed the total cost of attendance.</P>
              <P>(2) The SEA shall ensure that loans are reduced prior to reducing a scholarship awarded under this program.</P>
              <P>(c) The SEA shall ensure that the selection process is completed, and the awards made, prior to the end of each secondary school academic year.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the continuing eligibility criteria?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A scholar continues to be eligible for scholarship funds as long as the scholar continues to—</P>
              <P>(1) Meet the eligibility requirements in § 654.40(b), (e), and (f);</P>
              <P>(2) Be enrolled as a full-time student at an institution of higher education except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(3) Maintain satisfactory progress as determined by the institution of higher education the scholar is attending, in accordance with the criteria established in 34 CFR 668.14(e) of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations.</P>

              <P>(b) In order to be eligible for scholarship funds, a scholar must be enrolled full time for the first year of study. If after the first year of study, the SEA determines that unusual circumstances <PRTPAGE P="288"/>justify waiver of the full-time attendance requirement, the scholar may enroll part time and continue to receive a scholarship payment. The SEA shall prorate the payment according to the scholar's enrollment status for the academic period during which he or she continues to be enrolled on a part-time basis but remains otherwise eligible for the award. For example, if a scholar for whom the full-time enrollment requirement is waived by the SEA is enrolled as a half-time student for one semester, he or she is eligible to receive one-quarter of his or her scholarship during that semester.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the consequences of a scholar's failure to meet the eligibility criteria?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) An SEA may permit a scholar to postpone or interrupt his or her enrollment at an institution of higher education without forfeiting his or her scholarship for up to 12 months, beginning on the date the scholar otherwise would have enrolled in the institution after the SEA awarded his or her scholarship or the date the scholar interrupts enrollment.</P>
              <P>(2) A scholar who postpones or interrupts his or her enrollment at an institution of higher education in accordance with standards established by the SEA is not eligible to receive scholarship funds during the period of postponement or interruption, but is eligible to receive scholarship payments on enrollment or re-enrollment at an institution of higher education.</P>
              <P>(3) A scholar's periods of postponement or interruption, taken in accordance with standards established by the SEA and not in excess of 12 months, are not considered periods of suspension for the purposes of calculating the 12 months provided for suspension prior to termination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, if an SEA finds that a scholar fails to meet the requirements of § 654.51 within an award year, it shall suspend the scholar's eligibility to receive scholarship funds until the scholar is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the SEA that he or she meets these requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a scholar's eligibility for a scholarship is terminated when the total of his or her suspension periods exceeds 12 months.</P>
              <P>(3) In exceptional circumstances, the SEA may extend the 12-month suspension period without terminating a scholar's eligibility under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in accordance with standards established by the SEA.</P>
              <P>(c) A scholar who receives an award for a period for which the SEA subsequently determines the scholar was ineligible under the requirements in § 654.40 or 654.51 shall repay to the SEA the total amount of the scholarship funds received for the period during which he or she was ineligible.</P>

              <P>(a) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclosures.</E> (1) For each program offered by an institution under this section, the institution must provide prospective students with—</P>

              <P>(i) The occupations (by names and SOC codes) that the program prepares students to enter, along with links to occupational profiles on O*NET or its successor site. If the number of occupations related to the program, as identified by entering the program's full six digit CIP code on the O*NET crosswalk at <E T="03">http://online.onetcenter.org/crosswalk/</E> is more than ten, the institution may provide Web links to a representative sample of the identified occupations (by name and SOC code) for which its graduates typically find employment within a few years after completing the program;</P>
              <P>(ii) The on-time graduation rate for students completing the program, as provided under paragraph (c) of this section;</P>
              <P>(iii) The tuition and fees it charges a student for completing the program within normal time as defined in § 668.41(a), the typical costs for books and supplies (unless those costs are included as part of tuition and fees), and the cost of room and board, if applicable. The institution may include information on other costs, such as transportation and living expenses, but it must provide a Web link, or access, to the program cost information the institutions makes available under § 668.43(a);</P>
              <P>(iv) The placement rate for students completing the program, as determined under a methodology developed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) when that rate is available. In the meantime, beginning on July 1, 2011, if the institution is required by its accrediting agency or State to calculate a placement rate on a program basis, it must disclose the rate under this section and identify the accrediting agency or State agency under whose requirements the rate was calculated. If the accrediting agency or State requires an institution to calculate a placement rate at the institutional level or other than a program basis, the institution must use the accrediting agency or State methodology to calculate a placement rate for the program and disclose that rate; and</P>

              <P>(v) The median loan debt incurred by students who completed the program as provided by the Secretary, as well as any other information the Secretary provided to the institution about that program. The institution must identify separately the median loan debt from <PRTPAGE P="345"/>title IV, HEA program loans, and the median loan debt from private educational loans and institutional financing plans.</P>
              <P>(2) For each program, the institution must—</P>
              <P>(i) Include the information required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in promotional materials it makes available to prospective students and post this information on its Web site;</P>
              <P>(ii) Prominently provide the information required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in a simple and meaningful manner on the home page of its program Web site, and provide a prominent and direct link on any other Web page containing general, academic, or admissions information about the program, to the single Web page that contains all the required information;</P>
              <P>(iii) Display the information required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section on the institution's Web site in an open format that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used Web search applications. An open format is one that is platform-independent, is machine-readable, and is made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the reuse of that information; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Use the disclosure form issued by the Secretary to provide the information in paragraph (b)(1), and other information, when that form is available.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">On-time completion rate.</E> An institution calculates an on-time completion rate for each program subject to this section by—</P>
              <P>(1) Determining the number of students who completed the program during the most recently completed award year;</P>
              <P>(2) Determining the number of students in paragraph (c)(1) of this section who completed the program within normal time, as defined under § 668.41(a), regardless of whether the students transferred into the program or changed programs at the institution. For example, the normal time to complete an associate degree is two years and this timeframe applies to all students in the program. If a student transfers into the program, regardless of the number of credits the institution accepts from the student's attendance at the prior institution, those transfer credits have no bearing on the two-year timeframe. The student would still have two years to complete from the date he or she began attending the two-year program. To be counted as completing on time, a student who changes programs at the institution and begins attending the two-year program must complete within the two-year timeframe beginning from the date the student began attending the prior program; and</P>
              <P>(3) Dividing the number of students who completed the program within normal time, as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, by the total number of students who completed the program, as determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and multiplying the result by 100.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Sunset provisions.</E> Institutions must comply with the requirements of this section through December 31, 2016.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 668.10</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Direct assessment programs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) A <E T="03">direct assessment program</E> is an instructional program that, in lieu of credit hours or clock hours as a measure of student learning, utilizes direct assessment of student learning, or recognizes the direct assessment of student learning by others. The assessment must be consistent with the accreditation of the institution or program utilizing the results of the assessment.</P>

              <P>(2) Direct assessment of student learning means a measure by the institution of what a student knows and can do in terms of the body of knowledge making up the educational program. These measures provide evidence that a student has command of a specific subject, content area, or skill or that the student demonstrates a specific quality such as creativity, analysis or synthesis associated with the subject matter of the program. Examples of direct measures include projects, papers, examinations, presentations, performances, and portfolios.<PRTPAGE P="350"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) All regulatory requirements in this chapter that refer to credit or clock hours as a measurement apply to direct assessment programs. Because a direct assessment program does not utilize credit or clock hours as a measure of student learning, an institution must establish a methodology to reasonably equate the direct assessment program (or the direct assessment portion of any program, as applicable) to credit or clock hours for the purpose of complying with applicable regulatory requirements. The institution must provide a factual basis satisfactory to the Secretary for its claim that the program or portion of the program is equivalent to a specific number of credit or clock hours.</P>
              <P>(i) An academic year in a direct assessment program is a period of instructional time that consists of a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time during which, for an undergraduate educational program, a full-time student is expected to complete the equivalent of at least 24 semester or trimester credit hours, 36 quarter credit hours or 900 clock hours.</P>
              <P>(ii) A payment period in a direct assessment program for which equivalence in credit hours has been established must be determined under the requirements in § 668.4(a), (b), or (c), as applicable, using the academic year determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section (or the portion of that academic year comprising or remaining in the program). A payment period in a direct assessment program for which equivalence in clock hours has been established must be determined under the requirements in § 668.4(c), using the academic year determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section (or the portion of that academic year comprising or remaining in the program).</P>
              <P>(iii) A week of instructional time in a direct assessment program is any seven-day period in which at least one day of educational activity occurs. Educational activity in a direct assessment program includes regularly scheduled learning sessions, faculty-guided independent study, consultations with a faculty mentor, development of an academic action plan addressed to the competencies identified by the institution, or, in combination with any of the foregoing, assessments. It does not include credit for life experience. For purposes of direct assessment programs, independent study occurs when a student follows a course of study with predefined objectives but works with a faculty member to decide how the student is going to meet those objectives. The student and faculty member agree on what the student will do (e.g., required readings, research, and work products), how the student's work will be evaluated, and on what the relative timeframe for completion of the work will be. The student must interact with the faculty member on a regular and substantive basis to assure progress within the course or program.</P>

              <P>(iv) A full-time student in a direct assessment program is an enrolled student who is carrying a full-time academic workload as determined by the institution under a standard applicable to all students enrolled in the program. However, for an undergraduate student, the institution's minimum standard must equal or exceed the minimum full-time requirements specified in the definition of <E T="03">full-time student</E> in § 668.2 based on the credit or clock hour equivalency established by the institution for the direct assessment program.</P>
              <P>(b) An institution that offers a direct assessment program must apply to the Secretary to have that program determined to be an eligible program for title IV, HEA program purposes. The institution's application must provide information satisfactory to the Secretary that includes—</P>
              <P>(1) A description of the educational program, including the educational credential offered (degree level or certificate) and the field of study;</P>
              <P>(2) A description of how the assessment of student learning is done;</P>
              <P>(3) A description of how the direct assessment program is structured, including information about how and when the institution determines on an individual basis what each student enrolled in the program needs to learn;</P>
              <P>(4) A description of how the institution assists students in gaining the knowledge needed to pass the assessments;</P>

              <P>(5) The number of semester or quarter credit hours, or clock hours, that <PRTPAGE P="351"/>are equivalent to the amount of student learning being directly assessed for the certificate or degree, as required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section;</P>
              <P>(6) The methodology the institution uses to determine the number of credit or clock hours to which the program is equivalent;</P>
              <P>(7) The methodology the institution uses to determine the number of credit or clock hours to which the portion of a program an individual student will need to complete is equivalent;</P>
              <P>(8) Documentation from the institution's accrediting agency indicating that the agency has evaluated the institution's offering of direct assessment program(s) and has included the program(s) in the institution's grant of accreditation;</P>
              <P>(9) Documentation from the accrediting agency or relevant state licensing body indicating agreement with the institution's claim of the direct assessment program's equivalence in terms of credit or clock hours; and</P>
              <P>(10) Any other information the Secretary may require to determine whether to approve the institution's application.</P>
              <P>(c) To be an eligible program, a direct assessment program must meet the requirements in § 668.8 including, if applicable, minimum program length and qualitative factors.</P>
              <P>(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, no program offered by a foreign institution that involves direct assessment will be considered to be an eligible program under § 668.8.</P>
              <P>(e) A direct assessment program may use learning resources (e.g., courses or portions of courses) that are provided by entities other than the institution providing the direct assessment program without regard to the limitations on contracting for part of an educational program in § 668.5(c)(3).</P>
              <P>(f) Title IV, HEA program funds may be used only for learning that results from instruction provided, or overseen, by the institution, not for the portion of the program that the student has demonstrated mastery of prior to enrollment in the program or tests of learning that are not associated with educational activities overseen by the institution.</P>
              <P>(g) Title IV, HEA program eligibility with respect to direct assessment programs is limited to direct assessment programs approved by the Secretary. Title IV, HEA program funds may not be used for—</P>
              <P>(1) the course of study described in § 668.32(a)(1)(ii) and (iii) if offered by direct assessment, or</P>
              <P>(2) remedial coursework described in § 668.20 offered by direct assessment. However, remedial instruction that is offered in credit or clock hours in conjunction with a direct assessment program is eligible for title IV, HEA program funds.</P>
              <P>(h) The Secretary's approval of a direct assessment program expires on the date that the institution changes one or more aspects of the program described in the institution's application submitted under paragraph (b) of this section. To maintain program eligibility, the institution must obtain prior approval from the Secretary through reapplication under paragraph (b) of this section that sets forth the revisions proposed.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements for certification.</E> (1) The Secretary certifies an institution to participate in the title IV, HEA programs if the institution qualifies as an eligible institution under 34 CFR part 600, meets the standards of this subpart and 34 CFR part 668, subpart L, and satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if an institution wishes to participate for the first time in the title IV, HEA programs or has undergone a change in ownership that results in a change in control as described in 34 CFR 600.31, the institution must require the following individuals to complete title IV, HEA program training provided or approved by the Secretary no later than 12 months after the institution executes its program participation agreement under § 668.14:</P>
              <P>(i) The individual the institution designates under § 668.16(b)(1) as its title IV, HEA program administrator.</P>
              <P>(ii) The institution's chief administrator or a high level institutional official the chief administrator designates.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) An institution may request the Secretary to waive the training requirement for any individual described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) When the Secretary receives a waiver request under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the Secretary may grant or deny the waiver, require another institutional official to take the training, or require alternative training.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Period of participation.</E> (1) If the Secretary certifies that an institution meets the standards of this subpart, the Secretary also specifies the period for which the institution may participate in a title IV, HEA program. An institution's period of participation expires no more than six years after the date that the Secretary certifies that the institution meets the standards of this subpart, except that—</P>
              <P>(i) The period of participation for a private, for profit foreign institution expires three years after the date of the Secretary's certification; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary may specify a shorter period.</P>
              <P>(2) Provided that an institution has submitted an application for a renewal of certification that is materially complete at least 90 days prior to the expiration of its current period of participation, the institution's existing certification will be extended on a month to month basis following the expiration of the institution's period of participation until the end of the month in which the Secretary issues a decision on the application for recertification.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Provisional certification.</E> (1)(i) The Secretary may provisionally certify an institution if—</P>
              <P>(A) The institution seeks initial participation in a Title IV, HEA program;</P>
              <P>(B) The institution is an eligible institution that has undergone a change in ownership that results in a change in control according to the provisions of 34 CFR part 600;</P>
              <P>(C) The institution is a participating institution—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) That is applying for a certification that the institution meets the standards of this subpart;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) That the Secretary determines has jeopardized its ability to perform its financial responsibilities by not meeting the factors of financial responsibility under § 668.15 and subpart L of this part or the standards of administrative capability under § 668.16; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Whose participation has been limited or suspended under subpart G of this part, or voluntarily enters into provisional certification;</P>
              <P>(D) The institution seeks a renewal of participation in a Title IV, HEA program after the expiration of a prior period of participation in that program; or</P>

              <P>(E) The institution is a participating institution that was accredited or <PRTPAGE P="353"/>preaccredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency on the day before the Secretary withdrew the Secretary's recognition of that agency according to the provisions contained in 34 CFR part 603.</P>
              <P>(ii) A proprietary institution's certification automatically becomes provisional at the start of a fiscal year after it did not derive at least 10 percent of its revenue for its preceding fiscal year from sources other than Title IV, HEA program funds, as required under § 668.14(b)(16).</P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary provisionally certifies an institution, the Secretary also specifies the period for which the institution may participate in a Title IV, HEA program. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) (3) and (4) of this section, a provisionally certified institution's period of participation expires—</P>
              <P>(i) Not later than the end of the first complete award year following the date on which the Secretary provisionally certified the institution under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) Not later than the end of the third complete award year following the date on which the Secretary provisionally certified the institution under paragraphs (c)(1)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (e)(2) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) If the Secretary provisionally certified the institution under paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, not later than 18 months after the date that the Secretary withdrew recognition from the institutions nationally recognized accrediting agency.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding the maximum periods of participation provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the Secretary provisionally certifies an institution, the Secretary may specify a shorter period of participation for that institution.</P>
              <P>(4) For the purposes of this section, “provisional certification” means that the Secretary certifies that an institution has demonstrated to the Secretary's satisfaction that the institution—</P>
              <P>(i) Is capable of meeting the standards of this subpart within a specified period; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Is able to meet the institution's responsibilities under its program participation agreement, including compliance with any additional conditions specified in the institution's program participation agreement that the Secretary requires the institution to meet in order for the institution to participate under provisional certification.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Revocation of provisional certification.</E> (1) If, before the expiration of a provisionally certified institution's period of participation in a Title IV, HEA program, the Secretary determines that the institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, the Secretary may revoke the institution's provisional certification for participation in that program.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) If the Secretary revokes the provisional certification of an institution under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Secretary sends the institution a notice by certified mail, return receipt requested. The Secretary also may transmit the notice by other, more expeditious means, if practical.</P>
              <P>(ii) The revocation takes effect on the date that the Secretary mails the notice to the institution.</P>
              <P>(iii) The notice states the basis for the revocation, the consequences of the revocation to the institution, and that the institution may request the Secretary to reconsider the revocation. The consequences of a revocation are described in § 668.26.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) An institution may request reconsideration of a revocation under this section by submitting to the Secretary, within 20 days of the institution's receipt of the Secretary's notice, written evidence that the revocation is unwarranted. The institution must file the request with the Secretary by hand-delivery, mail, or facsimile transmission.</P>
              <P>(ii) The filing date of the request is the date on which the request is—</P>
              <P>(A) Hand-delivered;</P>
              <P>(B) Mailed; or</P>
              <P>(C) Sent by facsimile transmission.</P>

              <P>(iii) Documents filed by facsimile transmission must be transmitted to the Secretary in accordance with instructions provided by the Secretary in the notice of revocation. An institution filing by facsimile transmission is responsible for confirming that a complete and legible copy of the document was received by the Secretary.<PRTPAGE P="354"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) The Secretary discourages the use of facsimile transmission for documents longer than five pages.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) The designated department official making the decision concerning an institution's request for reconsideration of a revocation is different from, and not subject to supervision by, the official who initiated the revocation of the institution's provisional certification. The deciding official promptly considers an institution's request for reconsideration of a revocation and notifies the institution, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the final decision. The Secretary also may transmit the notice by other, more expeditious means, if practical.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the Secretary determines that the revocation is warranted, the Secretary's notice informs the institution that the institution may apply for reinstatement of participation only after the later of the expiration of—</P>
              <P>(A) Eighteen months after the effective date of the revocation; or</P>
              <P>(B) A debarment or suspension of the institution under Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 comp., p. 189) or the Federal Acquisition Regulations, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the Secretary determines that the revocation of the institution's provisional certification is unwarranted, the Secretary's notice informs the institution that the institution's provisional certification is reinstated, effective on the date that the Secretary's original revocation notice was mailed, for a specified period of time.</P>

              <P>(C)(<E T="03">1</E>) Has, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a positive unrestricted current fund balance or positive unrestricted net assets.

              <SUBJECT>Standards of administrative capability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>To begin and to continue to participate in any Title IV, HEA program, an institution shall demonstrate to the Secretary that the institution is capable of adequately administering that program under each of the standards established in this section. The Secretary considers an institution to have that administrative capability if the institution—</P>
              <P>(a) Administers the Title IV, HEA programs in accordance with all statutory provisions of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, all applicable regulatory provisions prescribed under that statutory authority, and all applicable special arrangements, agreements, and limitations entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA;</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Designates a capable individual to be responsible for administering all the Title IV, HEA programs in which it participates and for coordinating those programs with the institution's other Federal and non-Federal programs of student financial assistance. The Secretary considers an individual to be “capable” under this paragraph if the individual is certified by the State in which the institution is located, if the State requires certification of financial aid administrators. The Secretary may consider other factors in determining whether an individual is capable, including, but not limited to, the individual's successful completion of Title IV, HEA program training provided or approved by the Secretary, and previous experience and documented success in administering the Title IV, HEA programs properly;</P>
              <P>(2) Uses an adequate number of qualified persons to administer the Title IV, HEA programs in which the institution participates. The Secretary considers the following factors to determine whether an institution uses an adequate number of qualified persons—</P>
              <P>(i) The number and types of programs in which the institution participates;</P>
              <P>(ii) The number of applications evaluated;</P>
              <P>(iii) The number of students who receive any student financial assistance at the institution and the amount of funds administered;</P>
              <P>(iv) The financial aid delivery system used by the institution;</P>
              <P>(v) The degree of office automation used by the institution in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs;</P>
              <P>(vi) The number and distribution of financial aid staff; and</P>
              <P>(vii) The use of third-party servicers to aid in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs;</P>
              <P>(3) Communicates to the individual designated to be responsible for administering Title IV, HEA programs, all the information received by any institutional office that bears on a student's eligibility for Title IV, HEA program assistance; and</P>
              <P>(4) Has written procedures for or written information indicating the responsibilities of the various offices with respect to the approval, disbursement, and delivery of Title IV, HEA program assistance and the preparation and submission of reports to the Secretary;</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Administers Title IV, HEA programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls; and</P>

              <P>(2) Divides the functions of authorizing payments and disbursing or delivering funds so that no office has responsibility for both functions with respect to any particular student aided under the programs. For example, the functions of authorizing payments and disbursing or delivering funds must be divided so that for any particular student aided under the programs, the two functions are carried out by at least two organizationally independent individuals who are not members of the same family, as defined in § 668.15, or <PRTPAGE P="367"/>who do not together exercise substantial control, as defined in § 668.15, over the institution;</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Establishes and maintains records required under this part and the individual Title IV, HEA program regulations; and</P>

              <P>(e) For purposes of determining student eligibility for assistance under a title IV, HEA program, establishes, publishes, and applies reasonable standards for measuring whether an otherwise eligible student is maintaining satisfactory academic progress in his or her educational program. The Secretary considers an institution's standards to be reasonable if the standards are in accordance with the provisions specified in § 668.34.</P>
              <P>(f) Develops and applies an adequate system to identify and resolve discrepancies in the information that the institution receives from different sources with respect to a student's application for financial aid under Title IV, HEA programs.

              <P>(1) The source and amount of each type of aid offered;</P>
              <P>(2) The method by which aid is determined and disbursed, delivered, or applied to a student's account; and</P>
              <P>(3) The rights and responsibilities of the student with respect to enrollment at the institution and receipt of financial aid. This information includes the institution's refund policy, the requirements for the treatment of title IV, HEA program funds when a student withdraws under § 668.22, its standards of satisfactory progress, and other conditions that may alter the student's aid package;</P>
              <P>(i) Has provided all program and fiscal reports and financial statements required for compliance with the provisions of this part and the individual program regulations in a timely manner;</P>
              <P>(j) Shows no evidence of significant problems that affect, as determined by the Secretary, the institution's ability to administer a Title IV, HEA program and that are identified in—</P>

              <P>(k) Is not, and does not have any principal or affiliate of the institution (as those terms are defined in 2 CFR parts 180 and 3485) that is—</P>
              <P>(1) Debarred or suspended under Executive Order 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) or the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or</P>
              <P>(2) Engaging in any activity that is a cause under 2 CFR 180.700 or 180.800, as adopted at 2 CFR 3485.12, for debarment or suspension under E.O. 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) or the FAR, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4;</P>
              <P>(l) For an institution that seeks initial participation in a Title IV, HEA program, does not have more than 33 percent of its undergraduate regular students withdraw from the institution during the institution's latest completed award year. The institution must count all regular students who are enrolled during the latest completed award year, except those students who, during that period—</P>
              <P>(1) Withdrew from, dropped out of, or were expelled from the institution;</P>
              <P>(2) Were entitled to and actually received in a timely manner, a refund of 100 percent of their tuition and fees;</P>

              <P>(2)(i) However, if the Secretary determines that an institution's administrative capability is impaired solely because the institution fails to comply with paragraph (m)(1) of this section, and the institution is not subject to a loss of eligibility under §§ 668.187(a) or <PRTPAGE P="369"/>668.206(a), the Secretary allows the institution to continue to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. In such a case, the Secretary may provisionally certify the institution in accordance with § 668.13(c) except as provided in paragraphs (m)(2)(ii), (m)(2)(iii), (m)(2)(iv), and (m)(2)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) An institution that fails to meet the standard of administrative capability under paragraph (m)(1)(ii) based on two cohort default rates that are greater than or equal to 30 percent but less than or equal to 40 percent is not placed on provisional certification under paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section—</P>
              <P>(A) If it has timely filed a request for adjustment or appeal under §§ 668.209, 668.210, or 668.212 with respect to the second such rate, and the request for adjustment or appeal is either pending or succeeds in reducing the rate below 30 percent; or</P>
              <P>(B) If it has timely filed an appeal under § 668.213 after receiving the second such rate, and the appeal is either pending or successful; or</P>
              <P>(C)(<E T="03">1</E>) If it has timely filed a participation rate index challenge or appeal under § 668.204(c) or § 668.214 from either or both of the two rates, and the challenge or appeal is either pending or successful; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the second rate is the most recent draft rate, and the institution has timely filed a participation rate challenge to that draft rate that is either pending or successful.</P>
              <P>(iii) The institution may appeal the loss of full participation in a Title IV, HEA program under paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section by submitting an erroneous data appeal in writing to the Secretary in accordance with and on the grounds specified in §§ 668.192 or 668.211 as applicable;</P>
              <P>(iv) If the institution has 30 or fewer borrowers in the three most recent cohorts of borrowers used to calculate its cohort default rate under subpart N of this part, we will not provisionally certify it solely based on cohort default rates;</P>
              <P>(v) If a rate that would otherwise potentially subject the institution to provisional certification under paragraphs (m)(1)(ii) and (m)(2)(i) of this section is calculated as an average rate, we will not provisionally certify it solely based on cohort default rates;</P>
              <P>(n) Does not otherwise appear to lack the ability to administer the Title IV, HEA programs competently;</P>
              <P>(o) Participates in the electronic processes that the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(1) Provides at no substantial charge to the institution; and</P>
              <P>(2) Identifies through a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>; and</P>
              <P>(p) Develops and follows procedures to evaluate the validity of a student's high school completion if the institution or the Secretary has reason to believe that the high school diploma is not valid or was not obtained from an entity that provides secondary school education.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Readmission requirements for servicemembers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) An institution may not deny readmission to a person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform, service in the uniformed services on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation to perform service.</P>

              <P>(2)(i) An institution must promptly readmit to the institution a person described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section with the same academic status as the student had when the student last attended the institution or was last admitted to the institution, but did not begin attendance because of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation to perform service.<PRTPAGE P="370"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) “Promptly readmit” means that the institution must readmit the student into the next class or classes in the student's program beginning after the student provides notice of his or her intent to reenroll, unless the student requests a later date of readmission or unusual circumstances require the institution to admit the student at a later date.</P>
              <P>(iii) To readmit a person with the “same academic status” means that the institution admits the student—</P>
              <P>(A) To the same program to which he or she was last admitted by the institution or, if that exact program is no longer offered, the program that is most similar to that program, unless the student requests or agrees to admission to a different program;</P>
              <P>(B) At the same enrollment status that the student last held at the institution, unless the student requests or agrees to admission at a different enrollment status;</P>
              <P>(C) With the same number of credit hours or clock hours completed previously by the student, unless the student is readmitted to a different program to which the completed credit hours or clock hours are not transferable;</P>
              <P>(D) With the same academic standing (e.g., with the same satisfactory academic progress status) the student previously had; and</P>
              <P>(E)(<E T="03">1</E>) If the student is readmitted to the same program, for the first academic year in which the student returns, assessing—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The tuition and fee charges that the student was or would have been assessed for the academic year during which the student left the institution; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Up to the amount of tuition and fee charges that other students in the program are assessed for that academic year, if veterans' education benefits, as defined in section 480(c) of the HEA, or other servicemember education benefits, will pay the amount in excess of the tuition and fee charges assessed for the academic year in which the student left the institution; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the student is admitted to a different program, and for subsequent academic years for a student admitted to the same program, assessing no more than the tuition and fee charges that other students in the program are assessed for that academic year.</P>
              <P>(iv)(A) If the institution determines that the student is not prepared to resume the program with the same academic status at the point where the student left off, or will not be able to complete the program, the institution must make reasonable efforts at no extra cost to the student to help the student become prepared or to enable the student to complete the program including, but not limited to, providing refresher courses at no extra cost to the student and allowing the student to retake a pretest at no extra cost to the student.</P>
              <P>(B) The institution is not required to readmit the student on his or her return if—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) After reasonable efforts by the institution, the institution determines that the student is not prepared to resume the program at the point where he or she left off;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) After reasonable efforts by the institution, the institution determines that the student is unable to complete the program; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The institution determines that there are no reasonable efforts the institution can take to prepare the student to resume the program at the point where he or she left off or to enable the student to complete the program.</P>
              <P>(C)(<E T="03">1</E>) “Reasonable efforts” means actions that do not place an undue hardship on the institution.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) “Undue hardship” means an action requiring significant difficulty or expense when considered in light of the overall financial resources of the institution and the impact otherwise of such action on the operation of the institution.</P>
              <P>(D) The institution carries the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the student is not prepared to resume the program with the same academic status at the point where the student left off, or that the student will not be able to complete the program.</P>

              <P>(3) This section applies to an institution that has continued in operation since the student ceased attending or was last admitted to the institution <PRTPAGE P="371"/>but did not begin attendance, notwithstanding any changes of ownership of the institution since the student ceased attendance.</P>
              <P>(4) The requirements of this section supersede any State law (including any local law or ordinance), contract, agreement, policy, plan, practice, or other matter that reduces, limits, or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by this section for the period of enrollment during which the student resumes attendance, and continuing so long as the institution is unable to comply with such requirements through other means.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Service in the uniformed services.</E> For purposes of this section, service in the uniformed services means service, whether voluntary or involuntary, in the Armed Forces, including service by a member of the National Guard or Reserve, on active duty, active duty for training, or full-time National Guard duty under Federal authority, for a period of more than 30 consecutive days under a call or order to active duty of more than 30 consecutive days.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Readmission procedures.</E> (1) Any student whose absence from an institution is necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services shall be entitled to readmission to the institution if—</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the student (or an appropriate officer of the Armed Forces or official of the Department of Defense) gives advance oral or written notice of such service to an office designated by the institution, and provides such notice as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances;</P>
              <P>(ii) The cumulative length of the absence and of all previous absences from that institution by reason of service in the uniformed services, including only the time the student spends actually performing service in the uniformed services, does not exceed five years; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the student gives oral or written notice of his or her intent to return to an office designated by the institution—</P>

              <P>(B) For a student who is hospitalized for or convalescing from an illness or injury incurred in or aggravated during the performance of service in the uniformed services, not later than two years after the end of the period that is necessary for recovery from such illness or injury.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) An institution must designate one or more offices at the institution that a student may contact to provide notification of service required by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and notification of intent to return required by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) An institution may not require that the notice provided by the student under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(iii) of this section follow any particular format.</P>
              <P>(iii) The notice provided by the student under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section—</P>
              <P>(A) May not be subject to any rule for timeliness; timeliness must be determined by the facts in any particular case; and</P>

              <P>(iv) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, an “appropriate officer” is a commissioned, warrant, or noncommissioned officer authorized to give such notice by the military service concerned.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions to advance notice.</E> (1) No notice is required under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section if the giving of such notice is precluded by military necessity, such as—</P>
              <P>(i) A mission, operation, exercise, or requirement that is classified; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A pending or ongoing mission, operation, exercise, or requirement that may be compromised or otherwise adversely affected by public knowledge.</P>

              <P>(2) Any student (or an appropriate officer of the Armed Forces or official of the Department of Defense) who did not give advance written or oral notice of service to the appropriate official at the institution in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section may meet the notice requirement by submitting, at the time the student seeks <PRTPAGE P="372"/>readmission, an attestation to the institution that the student performed service in the uniformed services that necessitated the student's absence from the institution.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Cumulative length of absence.</E> For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a student's cumulative length of absence from an institution does not include any service—</P>
              <P>(1) That is required, beyond five years, to complete an initial period of obligated service;</P>
              <P>(2) During which the student was unable to obtain orders releasing the student from a period of service in the uniformed services before the expiration of the five-year period and such inability was through no fault of the student; or</P>

              <P>(C) If the student, or parent in the case of a parent PLUS loan, submits a timely response that confirms that they wish to receive all or a portion of a direct disbursement of the post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds, or confirms that a post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds may be credited to the student's account, the institution must disburse the funds in the manner specified by the student, or parent in the case of a parent PLUS loan, as soon as possible, but no later than 180 days after the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew, as defined in paragraph (l)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(D) If a student, or parent in the case of a parent PLUS loan, submits a late response to the institution's notice requesting confirmation, the institution may make the post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds as instructed by the student, or parent in the case of a parent PLUS loan (provided the institution disburses all the funds accepted by the student, or parent in the case of a parent PLUS loan), or decline to do so.</P>
              <P>(E) If a student, or parent in the case of a parent PLUS loan, submits a late response to the institution and the institution does not choose to make the post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds, the institution must inform the student, or parent in the case of a parent PLUS loan, in writing of the outcome of the post-withdrawal disbursement request.</P>
              <P>(F) If the student, or parent in the case of a parent PLUS loan, does not respond to the institution's notice, no portion of the post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds that the institution wishes to credit to the student's account, nor any portion of loan funds that would be disbursed directly to the student, or parent in the case of a parent PLUS loan, may be disbursed.</P>

              <P>(iv) An institution must document in the student's file the result of any notification made in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section of the student's right to cancel all or a <PRTPAGE P="379"/>portion of loan funds or of the student's right to accept or decline loan funds, and the final determination made concerning the disbursement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Withdrawal date for a student who withdraws from an institution that is required to take attendance.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, for a student who ceases attendance at an institution that is required to take attendance, including a student who does not return from an approved leave of absence, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, or a student who takes a leave of absence that does not meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the student's withdrawal date is the last date of academic attendance as determined by the institution from its attendance records.</P>
              <P>(2) An institution must document a student's withdrawal date determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and maintain the documentation as of the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew, as defined in paragraph (l)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) An institution is required to take attendance if—</P>
              <P>(A) An outside entity (such as the institution's accrediting agency or a State agency) has a requirement that the institution take attendance;</P>
              <P>(B) The institution itself has a requirement that its instructors take attendance; or</P>
              <P>(C) The institution or an outside entity has a requirement that can only be met by taking attendance or a comparable process, including, but not limited to, requiring that students in a program demonstrate attendance in the classes of that program, or a portion of that program.</P>
              <P>(ii) If, in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an institution is required to take attendance or requires that attendance be taken for only some students, the institution must use its attendance records to determine a withdrawal date in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section for those students.</P>
              <P>(iii)(A) If, in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an institution is required to take attendance, or requires that attendance be taken, for a limited period, the institution must use its attendance records to determine a withdrawal date in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section for that limited period.</P>
              <P>(B) A student in attendance the last time attendance is required to be taken during the limited period identified in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section who subsequently stops attending during the payment period will be treated as a student for whom the institution was not required to take attendance.</P>
              <P>(iv) If an institution is required to take attendance or requires that attendance be taken, on only one specified day to meet a census reporting requirement, the institution is not considered to take attendance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Withdrawal date for a student who withdraws from an institution that is not required to take attendance.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, for a student who ceases attendance at an institution that is not required to take attendance, the student's withdrawal date is—</P>
              <P>(i) The date, as determined by the institution, that the student began the withdrawal process prescribed by the institution;</P>
              <P>(ii) The date, as determined by the institution, that the student otherwise provided official notification to the institution, in writing or orally, of his or her intent to withdraw;</P>
              <P>(iii) If the student ceases attendance without providing official notification to the institution of his or her withdrawal in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the mid-point of the payment period (or period of enrollment, if applicable);</P>
              <P>(iv) If the institution determines that a student did not begin the institution's withdrawal process or otherwise provide official notification (including notice from an individual acting on the student's behalf) to the institution of his or her intent to withdraw because of illness, accident, grievous personal loss, or other such circumstances beyond the student's control, the date that the institution determines is related to that circumstance;</P>

              <P>(v) If a student does not return from an approved leave of absence as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, the date that the institution determines <PRTPAGE P="380"/>the student began the leave of absence; or</P>
              <P>(vi) If a student takes a leave of absence that does not meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the date that the student began the leave of absence.</P>
              <P>(2)(i)(A) An institution may allow a student to rescind his or her official notification to withdraw under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section by filing a written statement that he or she is continuing to participate in academically-related activities and intends to complete the payment period or period of enrollment.</P>
              <P>(B) If the student subsequently ceases to attend the institution prior to the end of the payment period or period of enrollment, the student's rescission is negated and the withdrawal date is the student's original date under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, unless a later date is determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a student both begins the withdrawal process prescribed by the institution and otherwise provides official notification of his or her intent to withdraw in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section respectively, the student's withdrawal date is the earlier date unless a later date is determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, an institution that is not required to take attendance may use as the student's withdrawal date a student's last date of attendance at an academically-related activity provided that the institution documents that the activity is academically related and documents the student's attendance at the activity.</P>
              <P>(4) An institution must document a student's withdrawal date determined in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section and maintain the documentation as of the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew, as defined in paragraph (l)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5)(i) “Official notification to the institution” is a notice of intent to withdraw that a student provides to an office designated by the institution.</P>
              <P>(ii) An institution must designate one or more offices at the institution that a student may readily contact to provide official notification of withdrawal.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Approved leave of absence.</E> (1) For purposes of this section (and, for a title IV, HEA program loan borrower, for purposes of terminating the student's in-school status), an institution does not have to treat a leave of absence as a withdrawal if it is an approved leave of absence. A leave of absence is an approved leave of absence if—</P>
              <P>(i) The institution has a formal policy regarding leaves of absence;</P>
              <P>(ii) The student followed the institution's policy in requesting the leave of absence;</P>
              <P>(iii) The institution determines that there is a reasonable expectation that the student will return to the school;</P>
              <P>(iv) The institution approved the student's request in accordance with the institution's policy;</P>
              <P>(v) The leave of absence does not involve additional charges by the institution;</P>
              <P>(vi) The number of days in the approved leave of absence, when added to the number of days in all other approved leaves of absence, does not exceed 180 days in any 12-month period;</P>
              <P>(vii) Except for a clock hour or nonterm credit hour program, upon the student's return from the leave of absence, the student is permitted to complete the coursework he or she began prior to the leave of absence; and</P>
              <P>(viii) If the student is a title IV, HEA program loan recipient, the institution explains to the student, prior to granting the leave of absence, the effects that the student's failure to return from a leave of absence may have on the student's loan repayment terms, including the exhaustion of some or all of the student's grace period.</P>
              <P>(2) If a student does not resume attendance at the institution at or before the end of a leave of absence that meets the requirements of this section, the institution must treat the student as a withdrawal in accordance with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of this paragraph—</P>

              <P>(i) The number of days in a leave of absence is counted beginning with the <PRTPAGE P="381"/>first day of the student's initial leave of absence in a 12-month period.</P>
              <P>(ii) A “12-month period” begins on the first day of the student's initial leave of absence.</P>
              <P>(iii) An institution's leave of absence policy is a “formal policy” if the policy—</P>
              <P>(A) Is in writing and publicized to students; and</P>
              <P>(B) Requires students to provide a written, signed, and dated request, that includes the reason for the request, for a leave of absence prior to the leave of absence. However, if unforeseen circumstances prevent a student from providing a prior written request, the institution may grant the student's request for a leave of absence, if the institution documents its decision and collects the written request at a later date.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Calculation of the amount of title IV assistance earned by the student</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The amount of title IV grant or loan assistance that is earned by the student is calculated by—</P>
              <P>(i) Determining the percentage of title IV grant or loan assistance that has been earned by the student, as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Applying this percentage to the total amount of title IV grant or loan assistance that was disbursed (and that could have been disbursed, as defined in paragraph (l)(1) of this section) to the student, or on the student's behalf, for the payment period or period of enrollment as of the student's withdrawal date.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Percentage earned.</E> The percentage of title IV grant or loan assistance that has been earned by the student is—</P>
              <P>(i) Equal to the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment that the student completed (as determined in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section) as of the student's withdrawal date, if this date occurs on or before—</P>
              <P>(A) Completion of 60 percent of the payment period or period of enrollment for a program that is measured in credit hours; or</P>
              <P>(B) Sixty percent of the clock hours scheduled to be completed for the payment period or period of enrollment for a program that is measured in clock hours; or</P>
              <P>(ii) 100 percent, if the student's withdrawal date occurs after—</P>
              <P>(A) Completion of 60 percent of the payment period or period of enrollment for a program that is measured in credit hours; or</P>
              <P>(B) Sixty percent of the clock hours scheduled to be completed for the payment period or period of enrollment for a program measured in clock hours.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Percentage unearned.</E> The percentage of title IV grant or loan assistance that has not been earned by the student is calculated by determining the complement of the percentage of title IV grant or loan assistance earned by the student as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Total amount of unearned title IV assistance to be returned.</E> The unearned amount of title IV assistance to be returned is calculated by subtracting the amount of title IV assistance earned by the student as calculated under paragraph (e)(1) of this section from the amount of title IV aid that was disbursed to the student as of the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Use of payment period or period of enrollment.</E> (i) The treatment of title IV grant or loan funds if a student withdraws must be determined on a payment period basis for a student who attended a standard term-based (semester, trimester, or quarter) educational program.</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) The treatment of title IV grant or loan funds if a student withdraws may be determined on either a payment period basis or a period of enrollment basis for a student who attended a non-term based educational program or a nonstandard term-based educational program.</P>
              <P>(B) An institution must consistently use either a payment period or period of enrollment for all purposes of this section for each of the following categories of students who withdraw from the same non-term based or nonstandard term-based educational program:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Students who have attended an educational program at the institution from the beginning of the payment period or period of enrollment.<PRTPAGE P="382"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Students who re-enter the institution during a payment period or period of enrollment.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Students who transfer into the institution during a payment period or period of enrollment.</P>
              <P>(iii) For a program that measures progress in credit hours and uses nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length, if the institution uses the payment period to determine the treatment of title IV grant or loan funds for a category of students found in paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, the institution must—</P>
              <P>(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) For students in the category who are disbursed or could have been disbursed aid using both the payment period definition in § 668.4(b)(1) and the payment period definition in § 668.4(b)(2), use the payment period during which the student withdrew that ends later; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If in the payment period that ends later there are funds that have been or could have been disbursed from overlapping payment periods, the institution must include in the return calculation any funds that can be attributed to the payment period that ends later; and</P>
              <P>(B) For students in the category who are disbursed or could have been disbursed aid using only the payment period definition in § 668.4(b)(1) or the payment period definition in § 668.4(b)(2), use the payment period definition for which title IV, HEA program funds were disbursed for a student's calculation under this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Percentage of payment period or period of enrollment completed.</E> (1) For purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment completed is determined—</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of a program that is measured in credit hours, by dividing the total number of calendar days in the payment period or period of enrollment into the number of calendar days completed in that period as of the student's withdrawal date; and</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) In the case of a program that is measured in clock hours, by dividing the total number of clock hours in the payment period or period of enrollment into the number of clock hours scheduled to be completed as of the student's withdrawal date.</P>
              <P>(B) The scheduled clock hours used must be those established by the institution prior to the student's beginning class date for the payment period or period of enrollment and must be consistent with the published materials describing the institution's programs, unless the schedule was modified prior to the student's withdrawal.</P>
              <P>(C) The schedule must have been established in accordance with requirements of the accrediting agency and the State licensing agency, if such standards exist.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) The total number of calendar days in a payment period or period of enrollment includes all days within the period that the student was scheduled to complete, except that scheduled breaks of at least five consecutive days are excluded from the total number of calendar days in a payment period or period of enrollment and the number of calendar days completed in that period.</P>
              <P>(ii) The total number of calendar days in a payment period or period of enrollment does not include—</P>
              <P>(A) Days in which the student was on an approved leave of absence; or</P>
              <P>(B) For a payment period or period of enrollment in which any courses in the program are offered in modules, any scheduled breaks of at least five consecutive days when the student is not scheduled to attend a module or other course offered during that period of time.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Return of unearned aid, responsibility of the institution.</E> (1) The institution must return, in the order specified in paragraph (i) of this section, the lesser of—</P>
              <P>(i) The total amount of unearned title IV assistance to be returned as calculated under paragraph (e)(4) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An amount equal to the total institutional charges incurred by the student for the payment period or period of enrollment multiplied by the percentage of title IV grant or loan assistance that has not been earned by the student, as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) For purposes of this section, “institutional charges” are tuition, fees, <PRTPAGE P="383"/>room and board (if the student contracts with the institution for the room and board) and other educationally-related expenses assessed by the institution.</P>
              <P>(3) If, for a non-term program an institution chooses to calculate the treatment of title IV assistance on a payment period basis, but the institution charges for a period that is longer than the payment period, “total institutional charges incurred by the student for the payment period” is the greater of—</P>
              <P>(i) The prorated amount of institutional charges for the longer period; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount of title IV assistance retained for institutional charges as of the student's withdrawal date.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Return of unearned aid, responsibility of the student.</E> (1) After the institution has allocated the unearned funds for which it is responsible in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, the student must return assistance for which the student is responsible in the order specified in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The amount of assistance that the student is responsible for returning is calculated by subtracting the amount of unearned aid that the institution is required to return under paragraph (g) of this section from the total amount of unearned title IV assistance to be returned under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The student (or parent in the case of funds due to a parent PLUS Loan) must return or repay, as appropriate, the amount determined under paragraph (h)(1) of this section to—</P>
              <P>(i) Any title IV loan program in accordance with the terms of the loan; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Any title IV grant program as an overpayment of the grant; however, a student is not required to return the following—</P>
              <P>(A) The portion of a grant overpayment amount that is equal to or less than 50 percent of the total grant assistance that was disbursed (and that could have been disbursed, as defined in paragraph (l)(1) of this section) to the student for the payment period or period of enrollment.</P>
              <P>(B) With respect to any grant program, a grant overpayment amount, as determined after application of paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, of 50 dollars or less that is not a remaining balance.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) A student who owes an overpayment under this section remains eligible for title IV, HEA program funds through and beyond the earlier of 45 days from the date the institution sends a notification to the student of the overpayment, or 45 days from the date the institution was required to notify the student of the overpayment if, during those 45 days the student—</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compliance audits and audited financial statements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General</E>—(1) <E T="03">Independent auditor.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “independent auditor” refers to an independent certified public accountant or a government auditor.

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance audits for institutions.</E> (1) An institution's compliance audit must cover, on a fiscal year basis, all title IV, HEA program transactions, and must cover all of those transactions that have occurred since the period covered by the institution's last compliance audit.</P>
              <P>(2) The compliance audit required under this section must be conducted in accordance with—</P>
              <P>(i) The general standards and the standards for compliance audits contained in the U.S. General Accounting Office's (GAO's) Government Auditing Standards. (This publication is available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402); and</P>
              <P>(ii) Procedures for audits contained in audit guides developed by, and available from, the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General.</P>
              <P>(3) The Secretary may require an institution to provide a copy of its compliance audit report to guaranty agencies or eligible lenders under the FFEL programs, State agencies, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, or nationally recognized accrediting agencies.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance audits for third-party servicers.</E> (1) A third-party servicer that administers title IV, HEA programs for institutions does not have to have a compliance audit performed if—</P>
              <P>(i) The servicer contracts with only one institution; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The audit of that institution's administration of the title IV, HEA programs involves every aspect of the servicer's administration of that program for that institution.</P>

              <P>(2) A third-party servicer that contracts with more than one participating institution may submit a compliance audit report that covers the <PRTPAGE P="387"/>servicer's administration of the title IV, HEA programs for all institutions with which the servicer contracts.</P>

Financial statements submitted to the Secretary must be prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and other guidance contained in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations; or in audit guides developed by, and available from, the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General , whichever is applicable. As part of these financial statements, the institution must include a detailed description of related entities based on the definition of a related entity as set forth in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 57. The disclosure requirements under this provision extend beyond those of SFAS 57 to include all related parties and a level of detail that would enable to Secretary to readily identify the related party. Such information may include, but is not limited to, the name, location and a description of the related entity including the nature and amount of any transactions between the related party and the institution, financial or otherwise, regardless of when they occurred.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Submission of additional financial statements.</E> To the extent requested by the Secretary in determining whether an institution is financially responsible, the Secretary may also require the submission of audited consolidated financial statements, audited full consolidating financial statements, audited combined financial statements or the audited financial statements of one or more related parties that have the ability, either individually or collectively, to significantly influence or control the institution, as determined by the Secretary.</P>

              <P>(4) <E T="03">Audited financial statements for third-party servicers.</E> A third-party servicer that enters into a contract with a lender or guaranty agency to administer any aspect of the lender's or guaranty agency's programs, as provided under 34 CFR part 682, must submit annually an audited financial statement. This financial statement must be prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards and other guidance contained in audit guides issued by the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Access to records.</E> (1) An institution or a third-party servicer that has a compliance or financial statement audit conducted under this section must—</P>

              <P>(i) Give the Secretary and the Inspector General access to records or other documents necessary to review that <PRTPAGE P="388"/>audit, including the right to obtain copies of those records or documents; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Require an individual or firm conducting the audit to give the Secretary and the Inspector General access to records, audit work papers, or other documents necessary to review that audit, including the right to obtain copies of those records, work papers, or documents.</P>
              <P>(2) An institution must give the Secretary and the Inspector General access to records or other documents necessary to review a third-party servicer's compliance or financial statement audit, including the right to obtain copies of those records or documents.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Determination of liabilities.</E> (1) Based on the audit finding and the institution's or third-party servicer's response, the Secretary determines the amount of liability, if any, owed by the institution or servicer and instructs the institution or servicer as to the manner of repayment.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary determines that a third-party servicer owes a liability for its administration of an institution's title IV, HEA programs, the servicer must notify each institution under whose contract the servicer owes a liability of that determination. The servicer must also notify every institution that contracts with the servicer for the same service that the Secretary determined that a liability was owed.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Repayments.</E> (1) An institution or third-party servicer that must repay funds under the procedures in this section shall repay those funds at the direction of the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the Secretary's notification, unless—</P>

              <P>(2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g)(1) of this section—</P>
              <P>(i) If an institution or third-party servicer has posted surety or has provided a third-party guarantee and the Secretary questions expenditures or compliance with applicable requirements and identifies liabilities, then the Secretary may determine that deferring recourse to the surety or guarantee is not appropriate because—</P>
              <P>(A) The need to provide relief to students or borrowers affected by the act or omission giving rise to the liability outweighs the importance of deferring collection action until completion of available appeal proceedings; or</P>
              <P>(B) The terms of the surety or guarantee do not provide complete assurance that recourse to that protection will be fully available through the completion of available appeal proceedings; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary may use administrative offset pursuant to 34 CFR part 30 to collect the funds owed under the procedures of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If, under the proceedings in subpart H, liabilities asserted in the Secretary's notification, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, to the institution or third-party servicer are upheld, the institution or third-party servicer must repay those funds at the direction of the Secretary within 30 days of the final decision under subpart H of this part unless—</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary determines that earlier collection action is appropriate pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) An institution is held responsible for any liability owed by the institution's third-party servicer for a violation incurred in servicing any aspect of that institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs and remains responsible for that amount until that amount is repaid in full.</P>

              <P>(4) <E T="03">Application of funds.</E> The institution must presume that any Title IV, HEA program funds it disburses, or delivers, to or on behalf of a student will be used to pay the student's tuition, fees, or institutional charges, regardless of whether the institution credits the funds to the student's account or pays the funds directly to the student, except to the extent that the student's tuition, fees, or other charges are satisfied by—</P>
              <P>(i) Grant funds provided by non-Federal public agencies or private sources independent of the institution;</P>

              <P>(5) <E T="03">Revenue generated from institutional aid.</E> The institution must include the following institutional aid as revenue:</P>

              <P>(A) Are bona fide as evidenced by standalone repayment agreements between the students and the institution that are enforceable promissory notes;</P>
              <P>(B) Are issued at intervals related to the institution's enrollment periods;</P>
              <P>(C) Are subject to regular loan repayments and collections by the institution; and</P>

              <P>(iii) For loans made to students on or after July 1, 2012, include as revenue only the amount of payments made on those loans that the institution received during the fiscal year.</P>

              <P>(iv) For scholarships provided by the institution in the form of monetary aid or tuition discount and based on the academic achievement or financial need of its students, include as revenue the amount disbursed to students during the fiscal year. The scholarships must be disbursed from an established <PRTPAGE P="399"/>restricted account and only to the extent that the funds in that account represent designated funds from an outside source or income earned on those funds.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Revenue generated from loan funds in excess of loan limits prior to the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (ECASLA).</E> For each student who receives an unsubsidized loan under the FFEL or Direct Loan programs on or after July 1, 2008 and prior to July 1, 2011, the amount of the loan disbursement for a payment period that exceeds the disbursement for which the student would have been eligible for that payment period under the loan limit in effect on the day prior to enactment of the ECASLA is included and deemed to be revenue from a source other than Title IV, HEA program funds but only to the extent that the excess amount pays for tuition, fees, or institutional charges remaining on the student's account after other Title IV, HEA program funds are applied.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Funds excluded from revenues.</E> For the fiscal year, the institution does not include—</P>
              <P>(i) The amount of Federal Work Study (FWS) wages paid directly to the student. However, if the institution credits the student's account with FWS funds, those funds are included as revenue;</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount of funds received by the institution from a State under the LEAP, SLEAP, or GAP programs;</P>
              <P>(iii) The amount of institutional funds used to match Title IV, HEA program funds;</P>
              <P>(iv) The amount of Title IV, HEA program funds refunded or returned under § 668.22. If any funds from the loan disbursement used in the return calculation under § 668.22 were counted as non-title IV revenue under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds refunded or returned under § 668.22 is considered to consist of pre-ECASLA loan amounts and loan amounts in excess of the loan limits prior to ECASLA in the same proportion to the loan disbursement; or</P>
              <P>(v) The amount the student is charged for books, supplies, and equipment unless the institution includes that amount as tuition, fees, or other institutional charges.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Net present value (NPV).</E> (1) As illustrated in appendix C of this subpart, an institution calculates the NPV of the loans it made under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section by—</P>

              <P>(i) Using the formula, NPV = sum of the discounted cash flows <E T="03">R</E>
                <SU>t</SU>/(1 + <E T="03">i</E>)<SU>t</SU>, where—</P>
              <P>(A) The variable “<E T="03">i</E>” is the discount rate. For purposes of this section, an institution must use the most recent annual inflation rate as the discount rate;</P>
              <P>(B) The variable “<E T="03">t</E>” is time or period of the cash flow, in years, from the time the loan entered repayment; and</P>
              <P>(C) The variable “<E T="03">R</E>
                <SU>t</SU>” is the net cash flow at time or period <E T="03">t</E>; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Applying the NPV formula to the loans made during the fiscal year by—</P>

              <P>(A) If the loans have substantially the same repayment period, using that repayment period for the range of values of variable “<E T="03">t</E>”; or</P>
              <P>(B) Grouping the loans by repayment period and using the repayment period for each group for the range of values of variable “t”; and</P>

              <P>(C) For each group of loans, as applicable, multiplying the total annual payments due on the loans by the institution's loan collection rate (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, the total amount of payments collected divided by the total amount of payments due). The resulting amount is used for variable “R” in each period “t”, for each group of loans that a NPV is calculated.</P>
              <P>(2) Instead of performing the calculations in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, using 50 percent of the total amount of loans that the institution made during the fiscal year as the NPV. However, if the institution chooses to use this 50 percent calculation, the institution may not sell any of these loans until they have been in repayment for at least two years.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Sanctions.</E> If an institution does not derive at least 10 percent of its revenue from sources other than Title IV, HEA program funds—</P>

              <P>(1) For two consecutive fiscal years, it loses its eligibility to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs for at least two fiscal years. To regain eligibility, the institution must demonstrate that <PRTPAGE P="400"/>it complied with the State licensure and accreditation requirements under 34 CFR 600.5(a)(4) and (a)(6), and the financial responsibility requirements under subpart L of this part, for a minimum of two fiscal years after the fiscal year it became ineligible; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any fiscal year, it becomes provisionally certified under § 668.13(c)(1)(ii) for the two fiscal years after the fiscal year it failed to satisfy the revenue requirement. However, the institution's provisional certification terminates on—</P>
              <P>(i) The expiration date of the institution's program participation agreement that was in effect on the date the Secretary determined the institution failed this requirement; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The date the institution loses its eligibility to participate under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(3) It must notify the Secretary no later than 45 days after the end of its fiscal year that it failed to meet this requirement.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part III Chapter 3—Independence</HD>
              <P>(a) The Third general standard for governmental auditing is: In matters relating to the audit work, the audit organization and the individual auditors shall maintain an independent attitude.</P>
              <P>(b) This standard places upon the auditor and the audit organization the responsibility for maintaining sufficient independence so that their opinions, conclusions, judgments, and recommendations will be impartial. If the auditor is not sufficiently independent to produce unbiased opinions, conclusions, and judgments, he should state in a prominent place in the audit report his relationship with the organization or officials being audited. <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/>
              </P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> If the auditor is not fully independent because he or she is an employee of the audited entity, it will be adequate disclosure to so indicate. If the auditor is a practicing certified public accountant, his or her conduct should be governed by the AICPA “Statements on Auditing Procedure.”</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(c) The auditor should consider not only whether his or her own attitude and beliefs permit him or her to be independent but also whether there is anything about his or her situation which would lead others to question his or her independence. Both situations deserve consideration since it is important not only that the auditor be, in fact, independent and impartial but also that other persons will consider him or her so.</P>
              <P>(d) There are three general classes of impairments that the auditor needs to consider; these are personal, external, and organizational impairments. If one or more of these are of such significance as to affect the auditor's ability to perform his or her work and report its results impartially, he or she should decline to perform the audit or indicate in the report that he or she was not fully independent.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Personal Impairments</HD>
              <P>There are some circumstances in which an auditor cannot be impartial because of his or her views or his or her personal situation. These circumstances might include:</P>
              <P>1. Relationships of an official, professional, and/or personal nature that might cause the auditor to limit the extent or character of the inquiry, to limit disclosure, or to weaken his or her findings in any way.</P>
              <P>2. Preconceived ideas about the objectives or quality of a particular operation or personal likes or dislikes of individuals, groups, or objectives of a particular program.</P>
              <P>3. Previous involvement in a decisionmaking or management capacity in the operations of the governmental entity or program being audited.</P>
              <P>4. Biases and prejudices, including those induced by political or social convictions, which result from employment in or loyalty to a particular group, entity, or level of government.</P>
              <P>5. Actual or potential restrictive influence when the auditor performs preaudit work and subsequently performs a post audit.</P>
              <P>6. Financial interest, direct or indirect, in an organization or facility which is benefiting from the audited programs.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">External Impairments</HD>
              <P>External factors can restrict the audit or impinge on the auditor's ability to form independent and objective opinions and conclusions. For example, under the following conditions either the audit itself could be adversely affected or the auditor would not have complete freedom to make an independent judgment. <SU>2</SU>

              </FTNT>
              <PRTPAGE P="401"/>
              <P>1. Interference or other influence that improperly or imprudently eliminates, restricts, or modifies the scope or character of the audit.</P>
              <P>2. Interference with the selection or application of audit procedures of the selection of activities to be examined.</P>
              <P>3. Denial of access to such sources of information as books, records, and supporting documents or denial or opportunity to obtain explanations by officials and employees of the governmental organization, program, or activity under audit.</P>
              <P>4. Interference in the assignment of personnel to the audit task.</P>
              <P>5. Retaliatory restrictions placed on funds or other resources dedicated to the audit operation.</P>
              <P>6. Activity to overrule or significantly influence the auditors judgment as to the appropriate content of the audit report.</P>

              <P>8. Unreasonable restriction on the time allowed to competently complete an audit assignment.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Organizational Impairments</HD>
              <P>(a) The auditor's independence can be affected by his or her place within the organizational structure of governments. Auditors employed by Federal, State, or local government units may be subject to policy direction from superiors who are involved either directly or indirectly in the government management process. To achieve maximum independence such auditors and the audit organization itself not only should report to the highest practicable echelon within their government but should be organizationally located outside the line-management function of the entity under audit.</P>
              <P>(b) These auditors should also be sufficiently removed from political pressures to ensure that they can conduct their auditing objectively and can report their conclusions completely without fear of censure. Whenever feasible they should be under a system which will place decisions on compensation, training, job tenure, and advancement on a merit basis.</P>
              <P>(c) When independent public accountants or other independent professionals are engaged to perform work that includes inquiries into compliance with applicable laws and regulations, efficiency and economy of operations, or achievement of program results, they should be engaged by someone other than the officials responsible for the direction of the effort being audited. This practice removes the pressure that may result if the auditor must criticize the performance of those by whom he or she was engaged. To remove this obstacle to independence, governments should arrange to have auditors engaged by officials not directly involved in operations to be audited.</P>

              <P>(b) The standards for examination and evaluation require consideration of applicable laws and regulations in the auditor's examination. The standards for reporting require a statement in the auditor's report regarding any significant instances of noncompliance disclosed by his or her examination and evaluation work. What is to be included in this statement requires judgment. Significant instances of noncompliance, even those not resulting in legal liability to the audited entity, should be included. Minor procedural noncompliance need not be disclosed.</P>
              <P>(c) Although the reporting standard is generally on an exception basis—that only noncompliance need be reported—it should be recognized that governmental entities often want positive statements regarding whether or not the auditor's tests disclosed instances of noncompliance. This is particularly true in grant programs where authorizing agencies frequently want assurance in the auditor's report that this matter has been considered. For such audits, auditors should obtain an understanding with the authorizing agency as to the extent to which such positive comments on compliance are desired. When coordinated audits are involved, the audit program should specify the extent of comments that the auditor is to make regarding compliance.</P>
              <P>(d) When noncompliance is reported, the auditor should place the findings in proper perspective. The extent of instances of noncompliance should be related to the number of cases examined to provide the reader with a basis for judging the prevalence of noncompliance.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, to be eligible to receive title IV, HEA program assistance, a student must—</P>
              <P>(1) Be a citizen or national of the United States; or</P>

              <P>(2) A student who satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is eligible to receive funds under the FWS, FSEOG, and Federal Pell Grant programs if the student attends a public or nonprofit private eligible institution of higher education in the Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, or the Republic of Palau.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Satisfactory academic progress.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Satisfactory academic progress policy.</E> An institution must establish a reasonable satisfactory academic progress policy for determining whether an otherwise eligible student is making satisfactory academic progress in his or her educational program and may receive assistance under the title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary considers the institution's policy to be reasonable if—</P>
              <P>(1) The policy is at least as strict as the policy the institution applies to a student who is not receiving assistance under the title IV, HEA programs;</P>

              <P>(2) The policy provides for consistent application of standards to all students within categories of students, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> full-time, part-time, undergraduate, and graduate students, and educational programs established by the institution;</P>
              <P>(3) The policy provides that a student's academic progress is evaluated—</P>
              <P>(i) At the end of each payment period if the educational program is either one academic year in length or shorter than an academic year; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For all other educational programs, at the end of each payment period or at least annually to correspond with the end of a payment period;</P>
              <P>(4)(i) The policy specifies the grade point average (GPA) that a student must achieve at each evaluation, or if a GPA is not an appropriate qualitative measure, a comparable assessment measured against a norm; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If a student is enrolled in an educational program of more than two academic years, the policy specifies that at the end of the second academic year, the student must have a GPA of at least a “C” or its equivalent, or have academic standing consistent with the institution's requirements for graduation;</P>
              <P>(5)(i) The policy specifies the pace at which a student must progress through his or her educational program to ensure that the student will complete the program within the maximum timeframe, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, and provides for measurement of the student's progress at each evaluation; and</P>
              <P>(ii) An institution calculates the pace at which the student is progressing by dividing the cumulative number of hours the student has successfully completed by the cumulative number of hours the student has attempted. In making this calculation, the institution is not required to include remedial courses;</P>
              <P>(6) The policy describes how a student's GPA and pace of completion are affected by course incompletes, withdrawals, or repetitions, or transfers of credit from other institutions. Credit hours from another institution that are accepted toward the student's educational program must count as both attempted and completed hours;</P>
              <P>(7) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the policy provides that, at the time of each evaluation, a student who has not achieved the required GPA, or who is not successfully completing his or her educational program at the required pace, is no longer eligible to receive assistance under the title IV, HEA programs;</P>
              <P>(8) If the institution places students on financial aid warning, or on financial aid probation, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, the policy describes these statuses and that—</P>
              <P>(i) A student on financial aid warning may continue to receive assistance under the title IV, HEA programs for one payment period despite a determination that the student is not making satisfactory academic progress. Financial aid warning status may be assigned without an appeal or other action by the student; and</P>

              <P>(ii) A student on financial aid probation may receive title IV, HEA program funds for one payment period. While a student is on financial aid probation, the institution may require the student to fulfill specific terms and conditions such as taking a reduced course load or enrolling in specific courses. At the end of one payment period on financial aid probation, the student must meet the institution's satisfactory academic progress standards or <PRTPAGE P="410"/>meet the requirements of the academic plan developed by the institution and the student to qualify for further title IV, HEA program funds;</P>
              <P>(9) If the institution permits a student to appeal a determination by the institution that he or she is not making satisfactory academic progress, the policy describes—</P>
              <P>(i) How the student may reestablish his or her eligibility to receive assistance under the title IV, HEA programs;</P>
              <P>(ii) The basis on which a student may file an appeal: The death of a relative, an injury or illness of the student, or other special circumstances; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Information the student must submit regarding why the student failed to make satisfactory academic progress, and what has changed in the student's situation that will allow the student to demonstrate satisfactory academic progress at the next evaluation;</P>
              <P>(10) If the institution does not permit a student to appeal a determination by the institution that he or she is not making satisfactory academic progress, the policy must describe how the student may reestablish his or her eligibility to receive assistance under the title IV, HEA programs; and</P>
              <P>(11) The policy provides for notification to students of the results of an evaluation that impacts the student's eligibility for title IV, HEA program funds.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to the terms used in this section:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Appeal.</E> Appeal means a process by which a student who is not meeting the institution's satisfactory academic progress standards petitions the institution for reconsideration of the student's eligibility for title IV, HEA program assistance.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Financial aid probation.</E> Financial aid probation means a status assigned by an institution to a student who fails to make satisfactory academic progress and who has appealed and has had eligibility for aid reinstated.</P>
              <P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Maximum timeframe.</E> Maximum timeframe means—</P>

              <P>(2) For an undergraduate program measured in clock hours, a period that is no longer than 150 percent of the published length of the educational program, as measured by the cumulative number of clock hours the student is required to complete and expressed in calendar time; and</P>
              <P>(3) For a graduate program, a period defined by the institution that is based on the length of the educational program.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Institutions that evaluate satisfactory academic progress at the end of each payment period.</E> (1) An institution that evaluates satisfactory academic progress at the end of each payment period and determines that a student is not making progress under its policy may nevertheless disburse title IV, HEA program funds to the student under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2), (c)(3), or (c)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) For the payment period following the payment period in which the student did not make satisfactory academic progress, the institution may—</P>
              <P>(i) Place the student on financial aid warning, and disburse title IV, HEA program funds to the student; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Place a student directly on financial aid probation, following the procedures outlined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and disburse title IV, HEA program funds to the student.</P>
              <P>(3) For the payment period following a payment period during which a student was on financial aid warning, the institution may place the student on financial aid probation, and disburse title IV, HEA program funds to the student if—</P>
              <P>(i) The institution evaluates the student's progress and determines that student did not make satisfactory academic progress during the payment period the student was on financial aid warning;</P>
              <P>(ii) The student appeals the determination; and</P>

              <P>(iii)(A) The institution determines that the student should be able to meet <PRTPAGE P="411"/>the institution's satisfactory academic progress standards by the end of the subsequent payment period; or</P>
              <P>(B) The institution develops an academic plan for the student that, if followed, will ensure that the student is able to meet the institution's satisfactory academic progress standards by a specific point in time.</P>
              <P>(4) A student on financial aid probation for a payment period may not receive title IV, HEA program funds for the subsequent payment period unless the student makes satisfactory academic progress or the institution determines that the student met the requirements specified by the institution in the academic plan for the student.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Institutions that evaluate satisfactory academic progress annually or less frequently than at the end of each payment period.</E> (1) An institution that evaluates satisfactory academic progress annually or less frequently than at the end of each payment period and determines that a student is not making progress under its policy may nevertheless disburse title IV, HEA program funds to the student under the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The institution may place the student on financial aid probation and may disburse title IV, HEA program funds to the student for the subsequent payment period if—</P>

              <SUBJECT>Social security number.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) Except for residents of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau, the Secretary attempts to confirm the social security number a student provides on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) under a data match with the Social Security Administration. If the Social Security Administration confirms that number, the Secretary notifies the institution and the student of that confirmation.</P>
              <P>(2) If the student's verified social security number is the same number as the one he or she provided on the FAFSA, and the institution has no reason to believe that the verified social security number is inaccurate, the institution may consider the number to be accurate.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Social Security Administration does not verify the student's social security number on the FAFSA, or the institution has reason to believe that the verified social security number is inaccurate, the student can provide evidence to the institution, such as the student's social security card, indicating the accuracy of the student's social security number. An institution must give a student at least 30 days, or until the end of the award year, whichever is later, to produce that evidence.</P>
              <P>(4) An institution may not deny, reduce, delay, or terminate a student's eligibility for assistance under the title IV, HEA programs because verification of that student's social security number is pending.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) An institution may not disburse any title IV, HEA program funds to a student until the institution is satisfied that the student's reported social security number is accurate.</P>
              <P>(2) The institution shall ensure that the Secretary is notified of the student's accurate social security number if the student demonstrates the accuracy of a social security number that is not the number the student included on the FAFSA.</P>
              <P>(c) If the Secretary determines that the social security number provided to an institution by a student is incorrect, and that student has not provided evidence under paragraph (a)(3) of this section indicating the accuracy of the social security number, and a loan has been guaranteed for the student under the FFEL program, the institution shall notify and instruct the lender and guaranty agency making and guaranteeing the loan, respectively, to cease further disbursements of the loan, until the Secretary or the institution determines that the social security number provided by the student is correct, but the guaranty may not be voided or otherwise nullified before the date that the lender and the guaranty agency receive the notice.</P>
              <P>(d) Nothing in this section permits the Secretary to take any compliance, disallowance, penalty or other regulatory action against—</P>
              <P>(1) Any institution of higher education with respect to any error in a social security number, unless the error was the result of fraud on the part of the institution; or</P>
              <P>(2) Any student with respect to any error in a social security number, unless the error was the result of fraud on the part of the student.</P>

              <P>(ii) Is enrolled in an officer procurement program the curriculum of which has been approved by the Secretary of Defense at the following institutions:</P>

              <P>(b)(1) When the Secretary processes a male student's FAFSA, the Secretary determines whether the student is registered with the Selective Service under a data match with the Selective Service.</P>
              <P>(2) Under the data match, Selective Service reports to the Secretary whether its records indicate that the student is registered, and the Secretary reports the results of the data match to the student and the institution the student is attending.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) If the Selective Service does not confirm through the data match, that the student is registered, the student can establish that he—</P>

              <P>(iv) Meets the conditions of paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) An institution must give a student at least 30 days, or until the end of the award year, whichever is later, to provide evidence to establish the condition described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) An institution may determine that a student, who was required to, but did not register with the Selective Service, is not ineligible to receive title IV, HEA assistance for that reason, if the student can demonstrate by submitting clear and unambiguous evidence to the institution that—</P>
              <P>(1) He was unable to present himself for registration for reasons beyond his control such as hospitalization, incarceration, or institutionalization; or</P>
              <P>(2) He is over 26 and when he was between 18 and 26 and required to register—</P>
              <P>(i) He did not knowingly and willfully fail to register with the Selective Service; or</P>
              <P>(ii) He served as a member of one of the U.S. Armed Forces on active duty and received a DD Form 214, “Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty,” showing military service with other than the reserve forces and National Guard.</P>
              <P>(e) For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, an institution may consider that a student did not knowingly and willfully fail to register with the Selective Service only if—</P>
              <P>(1) The student submits to the institution an advisory opinion from the Selective Service System that does not dispute the student's claim that he did not knowingly and willfully fail to register; and</P>
              <P>(2) The institution does not have uncontroverted evidence that the student knowingly and willfully failed to register.</P>
              <P>(f)(1) A student who is required to register with the Selective Service and has been denied title IV, HEA program assistance because he has not proven to the institution that he has registered with Selective Service may seek a hearing from the Secretary by filing a request in writing with the Secretary. The student must submit with that request—</P>
              <P>(i) A statement that he is in compliance with registration requirements;</P>
              <P>(ii) A concise statement of the reasons why he has not been able to prove that he is in compliance with those requirements; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Copies of all material that he has already supplied to the institution to verify his compliance.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary provides an opportunity for a hearing to a student who—</P>

              <P>(i) Asserts that he is in compliance with registration requirements; and<PRTPAGE P="415"/>
              </P>

              <P>(3) An official designated by the Secretary shall conduct any hearing held under paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The sole purpose of this hearing is the determination of compliance with registration requirements. At this hearing, the student retains the burden of proving compliance, by credible evidence, with the requirements of the Military Selective Service Act. The designated official shall not consider challenges based on constitutional or other grounds to the requirements that a student state and verify, if required, compliance with registration requirements, or to those registration requirements themselves.</P>
              <P>(g) Any determination of compliance made under this section is final unless reopened by the Secretary and revised on the basis of additional evidence.</P>
              <P>(h) Any determination of compliance made under this section is binding only for purposes of determining eligibility for title IV, HEA program assistance.</P>

              <P>(A) Using the calculation described in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section, the institution may submit an appeal to the Secretary within 15 days of receiving notification of its final loan repayment rate; and</P>

              <P>(ii) The institution demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that not all of its programs constitute GE programs and that if the borrowers in the non-GE programs were included in the calculation of the loan repayment rate, the loan repayment rate would show that the median borrower has made loan payments sufficient to reduce by at least one dollar the outstanding balance of each of the borrower's FFEL or Direct Loans received for enrollment in the institution.</P>

              <P>(2) An institution that determines that its mission includes providing substantial preparation for students to enroll in another eligible institution must prepare the transfer-out rate of its certificate- or degree-seeking, first-time, full-time undergraduate students, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) An institution that offers a predominant number of its programs based on semesters, trimesters, or quarters must base its completion or graduation rate, retention rate, and, if applicable, transfer-out rate calculations, on the cohort of certificate- or degree-seeking, first-time, full-time undergraduate students who enter the institution during the fall term of each year.</P>
              <P>(ii) An institution not covered by the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section must base its completion or graduation rate, retention rate, and, if applicable, transfer-out rate calculations, on the cohort of certificate- or degree-seeking, first-time, full-time undergraduate students who enter the institution between September 1 of one year and August 31 of the following year.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) An institution covered by the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section must count as an entering student a first-time undergraduate student who is enrolled as of October 15, the end of the institution's drop-add period, or another official reporting date as defined in § 668.41(a).</P>
              <P>(ii) An institution covered by paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section must count as an entering student a first-time undergraduate student who is enrolled for at least—</P>

              <P>(5) An institution must make available its completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer-out rate, no later than the July 1 immediately following the 12-month period ending August 31 during which 150 percent of the normal time for completion or graduation has elapsed for all of the students in the group on which the institution bases its completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer-out rate calculations.</P>

              <P>(6)(i) Completion or graduation rate information must be disaggregated by gender, by each major racial and ethnic subgroup (as defined in IPEDS), by recipients of a Federal Pell Grant, by recipients of a Federal Family Education Loan or a Federal Direct Loan (other than an Unsubsidized Stafford Loan made under the Federal Family Education Loan Program or a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan) who did not receive a Federal Pell Grant, and by recipients of neither a Federal Pell Grant nor a Federal Family Education Loan or a Federal Direct Loan (other than an Unsubsidized Stafford Loan made under the Federal Family Education Loan Program or a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan) if the number of students in such group or with such status is sufficient to yield statistically reliable information and reporting will not reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student. If such number is not sufficient for such purpose, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> is too small to be meaningful, then the institution shall note that the institution enrolled too few of such students to so disclose or report with confidence and confidentiality.</P>

              <P>(ii) With respect to the requirement in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section to disaggregate the completion or graduation rate information by the receipt or nonreceipt of Federal student aid, students shall be considered to have received the aid in question only if they <PRTPAGE P="425"/>received such aid for the period specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) Students who have completed a program described in § 668.8(b)(1)(ii), or an equivalent program, by the end of the 12-month period ending August 31 during which 150 percent of normal time for completion from that program has lapsed.</P>
              <P>(c) In calculating the transfer-out rate under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an institution must count as transfers-out students who by the end of the 12-month period ending August 31 during which 150 percent of the normal time for completion or graduation from the program in which they were enrolled has lapsed, have not completed or graduated but have subsequently enrolled in any program of an eligible institution for which its program provided substantial preparation.</P>
              <P>(d) For the purpose of calculating a completion or graduation rate and a transfer-out rate, an institution may—</P>
              <P>(1) Exclude students who—</P>

              <P>(e)(1) The Secretary grants a waiver of the requirements of this section dealing with completion and graduation rate data to any institution that is a member of an athletic association or conference that has voluntarily published completion or graduation rate data, or has agreed to publish data, that the Secretary determines are substantially comparable to the data required by this section.</P>
              <P>(2) An institution that receives a waiver of the requirements of this section must still comply with the requirements of § 668.41(d)(3) and (f).</P>
              <P>(3) An institution, or athletic association or conference applying on behalf of an institution, that seeks a waiver under paragraph (e)(1) of this section must submit a written application to the Secretary that explains why it believes the data the athletic association or conference publishes are accurate and substantially comparable to the information required by this section.</P>

              <P>(e)(1) Upon request by the institution or servicer, as applicable, the Secretary provides the institution or servicer, as soon as practicable, with an opportunity to show cause that the emergency action is unwarranted or should be modified.</P>
              <P>(2) An opportunity to show cause consists of an opportunity to present evidence and argument to a show-cause official. The initiating official does not act as the show-cause official for any emergency action that the initiating official has begun. The show-cause official is authorized to grant relief from the emergency action. The institution or servicer may make its presentation in writing or, upon its request, at an informal meeting with the show-cause official.</P>
              <P>(3) The show-cause official may limit the time and manner in which argument and evidence may be presented in order to avoid unnecessary delay or the presentation of immaterial, irrelevant, or repetitious matter.</P>
              <P>(4) The institution or servicer, as applicable, has the burden of persuading the show-cause official that the emergency action imposed by the notice is unwarranted or should be modified because—</P>
              <P>(i) The grounds stated in the notice did not, or no longer, exist;</P>
              <P>(ii) The grounds stated in the notice will not cause loss or misuse of Title IV, HEA program funds; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The institution or servicer, as applicable, will use procedures that will reliably eliminate the risk of loss from the misuse described in the notice.</P>
              <P>(5) The show-cause official continues, modifies, or revokes the emergency action promptly after consideration of any argument and evidence presented by the institution or servicer, as applicable, and the initiating official.</P>
              <P>(6) The show-cause official notifies the institution or servicer, as applicable, of that official's determination promptly after the completion of the show-cause meeting or, if no meeting is requested, after the official receives all the material submitted by the institution in opposition to the emergency action. In the case of a notice to a third-party servicer, the official also notifies each institution that contracts with the servicer of that determination. The show-cause official may explain that determination by adopting or modifying the statement of reasons provided in the notice of emergency action.</P>
              <P>(f)(1) An emergency action does not extend more than 30 days after initiated unless the Secretary initiates a limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding under this part or under 34 CFR part 600 against the institution or servicer, as applicable, within that 30-day period, in which case the emergency action continues until a final decision is issued in that proceeding, as provided in § 668.91(c), as applicable.</P>
              <P>(2) Until a final decision is issued by the Secretary in a proceeding described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, any action affecting the emergency action is at the sole discretion of the initiating official, or, if a show- cause proceeding is conducted, the show-cause official.</P>
              <P>(3) If an emergency action extends beyond 180 days by virtue of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the institution or servicer, as applicable, may then submit written material to the show-cause official to demonstrate that because of facts occurring after the later of the notice by the initiating official or the show-cause meeting, continuation of the emergency action is unwarranted and the emergency action should be modified or ended. The show-cause official considers any written material submitted and issues a determination that continues, modifies, or revokes the emergency action.</P>

              <P>(g) The expiration of an emergency action, or its modification or revocation by the show-cause official, does not bar subsequent emergency action on a ground other than one specifically <PRTPAGE P="459"/>identified in the notice imposing the prior emergency action. Separate grounds may include violation of an agreement or limitation imposed or resulting from the prior emergency action.</P>

              <P>(ii) Includes a statement of facts and law sufficient to show that the Department is entitled to grant any borrower defense relief asserted within the statement, and recover for the amount of losses to the Secretary caused by the granting of such relief;</P>
              <P>(iii) Specifies the date on which the Secretary intends to take action to recover the amount of losses arising from the granting of such relief, which date will be at least 20 days from mailing of the notice of intent and informs the institution that the Secretary will not take action to recover the amount of such loss on the date specified if the designated department official receives, by that date, a written response from the institution indicating why the Secretary should not recover. The notice shall also inform the institution that if it wishes to request a hearing pursuant to this subpart, the institution must include such a request with its written response; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Informs the institution whether the designated Department official intends to proceed with—</P>

              <P>(B) An action in two phases—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The determination whether the institution's act or omission gave rise to valid borrower defense claims; and</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of a response by the institution.</E> (1) If the institution submits a written response, but does not therein request a hearing, the designated department official, after considering that material, notifies the institution whether the Secretary will take the proposed recovery action for borrower defense claims and, if so, the date of such action and the amount of losses.</P>
              <P>(2) If the institution submits a response and requests a hearing by the time specified in the notice under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the designated department official may, in that official's sole discretion, withdraw the notice or transmit the response and request for hearing to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, which sets the date and the place for the hearing. The date of the hearing is at least 15 days after the designated department official receives the request. No liability shall be imposed on the institution prior to the hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitations on participation.</E> The parties in any borrower defense and recovery proceeding are the Department <PRTPAGE P="463"/>and the institution(s) against which the Department seeks to recover losses caused to the Department as a result of borrower defense relief. Borrowers are not permitted to intervene or appear in this proceeding, either on their own behalf or on behalf of any purported group, except as witnesses put forth by either party. However, nothing in this section limits the rights available to borrowers under other regulations, including 34 CFR 685.206 and 685.222.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect on the borrower.</E> No proceeding under this subpart imposes liability on any borrower who has already obtained a discharge in an individual proceeding under 34 CFR 685.206(c) or 34 CFR 685.222(e). A borrower defense and recovery proceeding may determine whether and how much relief is due to, and whether and how much of a loan remains owing by, a borrower participating in a group process proceeding as defined in 34 CFR 685.222(f) through (h).</P>

              <P>(a) A hearing is an orderly presentation of arguments and evidence conducted by a hearing official. At the discretion of the hearing official, any right to a hearing may be satisfied by one or more of the following: Summary disposition pursuant to § 668.88(e), with or without oral argument; an oral evidentiary hearing conducted in person, by telephone, by video conference, or any combination thereof; or a review limited to written evidence.<PRTPAGE P="464"/>

              <P>(b)(1) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the hearing official sets the procedures to be used in the hearing, and may take steps to expedite the proceeding as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) The formal rules of evidence and procedures applicable to proceedings in a court of law are not applicable. However, discussions of settlement between the parties or the terms of settlement offers are not admissible to prove the validity or invalidity of any claim or defense.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) The proponent of any factual proposition has the burden of proof with respect thereto.</P>
              <P>(ii) The designated department official has the burden of persuasion in any fine, suspension, limitation, or termination proceeding under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(iii) The designated department official has the burden of persuasion in a borrower defense and recovery action; however, for a borrower defense claim based on a substantial misrepresentation under § 682.222(d), the designated department official has the burden of persuasion regarding the substantial misrepresentation, and the institution has the burden of persuasion in establishing any offsetting value of the education under § 685.222(i)(2)(i).</P>
              <P>(4) Discovery, as provided for under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is not permitted.</P>
              <P>(5) The hearing official accepts only evidence that is relevant and material to the proceeding and is not unduly repetitious.</P>
              <P>(6) The hearing official may restrict the number of witnesses or exclude witnesses to avoid undue delay or presentation of cumulative evidence. Any witness permitted to appear may do so via telephonic, video, or other means, with the approval of the hearing official.</P>
              <P>(7) Either party may call qualified expert witnesses. Each party will be limited to calling three expert witnesses, as a matter of right, including any rebuttal or surrebuttal witnesses. Additional expert witnesses shall be allowed only by order of the hearing official, granted only upon a showing of good cause.</P>
              <P>(i) At a date set by the hearing official, each party shall serve the other with any report prepared by each of its expert witnesses. Each party shall serve the other party with a list of any rebuttal expert witnesses and a rebuttal report prepared by each such witness not later than 60 days after the deadline for service of expert reports, unless another date is set by the hearing official. A rebuttal report shall be limited to rebuttal of matters set forth in the expert report for which it is offered in rebuttal. If material outside the scope of fair rebuttal is presented, a party may file a motion not later than five days after the deadline for service of rebuttal reports, seeking appropriate relief with the hearing official, including striking all or part of the report, leave to submit a surrebuttal report by the party's own experts, or leave to call a surrebuttal witness and to submit a surrebuttal report by that witness.</P>
              <P>(ii) No party may call an expert witness at the hearing unless the party has listed the expert and has provided reports as required by this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) Each report shall be signed by the expert and contain a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefor; the data, materials, or other information considered by the witness in forming the opinions; any exhibits to be used as a summary of or support for the opinions; the qualifications of the witness, including a list of all publications authored or co-authored by the witness within the preceding ten years; the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony; and a listing of any other cases in which the witness has testified or sought to testify as an expert at trial or hearing, or by deposition, within the preceding four years. A rebuttal or surrebuttal report need not include any information already included in the initial report of the witness.</P>

              <P>(8)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, if an institution has been required through compulsory process under section 490A of the HEA or other applicable law to submit to the United States or to the Department material regarding an express or an implied representation, the institution cannot thereafter, in any proceeding under this subpart in which it <PRTPAGE P="465"/>is alleged that the representation was false, erroneous, or misleading, and for any purpose relating to the defense of such allegation, introduce into the record, either directly or indirectly through references contained in documents or oral testimony, any material of any type that was required to be but was not timely submitted in response to that compulsory process.</P>
              <P>(ii) The hearing official shall, upon motion at any stage, exclude all material that was required to be but was not timely submitted in response to a compulsory process described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, or any reference to such material, unless the institution demonstrates, and the hearing official finds, that by the exercise of due diligence the material could not have been timely submitted in response to the compulsory process, and the institution notified the Department or such other party that issued the order to produce, of the existence of the material immediately upon its discovery. The hearing official shall specify with particularity the evidence relied upon.</P>
              <P>(9) When issues not raised in the notice of proposed action are tried without objection at the hearing, they will be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the notice of proposed action, and no formal amendments are required.</P>
              <P>(c) The hearing official makes a transcribed record of the proceeding and makes a copy of the record available to the designated Department official and to the institution or servicer.</P>

              <P>(B) The 60th day after the last submission is filed with the hearing official if the Secretary, upon request of the hearing official, determines that the unusual complexity of the case requires additional time for preparation of the decision.</P>

              <P>(C) The 50th day after the last day of the hearing, if the hearing official does not request the parties to make any posthearing submission.<PRTPAGE P="466"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2)(i) The hearing official's initial decision states whether the imposition of the fine, limitation, suspension, or termination or recovery sought by the designated department official is warranted, in whole or in part. If the designated department official brought a termination action against the institution or servicer, the hearing official may, if appropriate, issue an initial decision to fine the institution or servicer, as applicable, or, rather than terminating the institution's participation or servicer's eligibility, as applicable, impose one or more limitations on the institution's participation or servicer's eligibility.</P>
              <P>(ii) In a borrower defense and recovery proceeding conducted in two phases under § 668.87(a)(1)(iv)(B), the hearing official's initial decision determines whether the institution is liable for the act or omission described in the notice of intent to recover, and the hearing official issues an initial decision on liability only.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section—</P>
              <P>(i) If, in a termination action against an institution, the hearing official finds that the institution has violated the provisions of § 668.14(b)(18), the hearing official also finds that termination of the institution's participation is warranted;</P>

              <P>(iii) In an action brought against an institution or third-party servicer that involves its failure to provide a letter of credit or other financial protection under § 668.15 or § 668.171(c) through (g), the hearing official finds that the amount of the letter of credit or other financial protection established by the Secretary under § 668.175(f)(4) is appropriate, unless the institution can demonstrate that the amount was not warranted because—</P>
              <P>(A) For financial protection demanded based on events or conditions described in § 668.171(c) through (f), the events or conditions no longer exist or have been resolved or the institution demonstrates that it has insurance that will cover the debts and liabilities that arise from the triggering event or condition, or, for a condition or event described in § 668.171(c)(1)(iii) (teach out) or (iv) (gainful employment eligibility loss), the amount of educationally related expenses reasonably attributable to the programs or location is greater than the amount calculated in accordance with Appendix C of subpart L of this part. The institution can demonstrate that insurance covers risk by presenting the Department with a statement from the insurer that the institution is covered for the full or partial amount of the liability in question;</P>
              <P>(B) For financial protection demanded based on a suit described in § 668.171(c)(1)(i) that does not state a specific amount of relief and on which the court has not ruled on the amount of relief, the institution demonstrates that, accepting the facts alleged as true, and assuming the claims asserted are fully successful, the action pertains to a period, program, or location for which the maximum potential relief is less than the amount claimed or the amount determined under § 668.171(c)(2)(ii);</P>
              <P>(C) For financial protection demanded based on the ground identified in § 668.171(g), the factor or event does not and will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, or results of operations of the institution;</P>
              <P>(D)(<E T="03">1</E>) For financial protection demanded under § 668.175(f)(4)(i), the institution does not participate and has not participated for the prior fiscal year in a title IV, HEA loan program; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For any financial protection demanded of an institution described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(D)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, and any portion of financial protection demanded of any other institution greater than 10 percent of the amount of title IV, HEA funds received by the institution in its most recently completed fiscal year—</P>
              <P>(i) The risk of loss to the Secretary on the grounds demonstrated by the Secretary does not exist;</P>

              <P>(ii) The loss as demonstrated by the Secretary is not reasonably likely to arise within the next 18 months; or<PRTPAGE P="467"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The amount is unnecessary to protect, or contrary to, the Federal interest;</P>
              <P>(E) The institution has proffered alternative financial protection that provides students and the Department adequate protection against losses resulting from the risks identified by the Secretary. In the Secretary's discretion, adequate protection may consist of one or more of the following—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) An agreement with the Secretary that a portion of the funds due to the institution under a reimbursement or heightened cash monitoring funding arrangement will be temporarily withheld in such amounts as will meet, no later than the end of a nine-month period, the amount of the required financial protection demanded; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Other form of financial protection specified by the Secretary in a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
              <P>(iv) In a termination action taken against an institution or third-party servicer based on the grounds that the institution or servicer failed to comply with the requirements of § 668.23(c)(3), if the hearing official finds that the institution or servicer failed to meet those requirements, the hearing official finds that the termination is warranted;</P>
              <P>(v)(A) In a termination action against an institution based on the grounds that the institution is not financially responsible under § 668.15(c)(1), the hearing official finds that the termination is warranted unless the institution demonstrates that all applicable conditions described in § 668.15(d)(4) have been met; and</P>
              <P>(B) In a termination or limitation action against an institution based on the grounds that the institution is not financially responsible—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Upon proof of the conditions in § 668.174(a), the hearing official finds that the limitation or termination is warranted unless the institution demonstrates that all the conditions in § 668.175(f) have been met; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Upon proof of the conditions in § 668.174(b)(1), the hearing official finds that the limitation or termination is warranted unless the institution demonstrates that all applicable conditions described in § 668.174(b)(2) or § 668.175(g) have been met.</P>
              <P>(4) The hearing official bases findings of fact only on evidence considered at the hearing and on matters given judicial notice.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) In a suspension proceeding, the Secretary reviews the hearing official's initial decision and issues a final decision within 20 days after the initial decision. The Secretary adopts the initial decision unless it is clearly unsupported by the evidence presented at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary notifies the institution or servicer and, in the case of a suspension proceeding against a third-party servicer, each institution that contracts with the servicer of the final decision. If the Secretary suspends the institution's participation or servicer's eligibility, the suspension takes effect on the later of—</P>
              <P>(i) The day that the institution or servicer receives the notice; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The date specified in the designated department official's original notice of intent to suspend the institution's participation or servicer's eligibility.</P>
              <P>(3) A suspension may not exceed 60 days unless a designated department official begins a limitation or termination proceeding under this subpart before the expiration of that period. In that case, the period may be extended until a final decision is issued in that proceeding according to paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) In a fine, limitation, or termination proceeding, the hearing official's initial decision automatically becomes the Secretary's final decision 30 days after the initial decision is issued and received by both parties unless, within that 30-day period, the institution or servicer, as applicable, or the designated department official appeals the initial decision to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) A party may appeal the hearing official's initial decision by submitting to the Secretary, within 30 days after the party receives the initial decision, a brief or other written statement that explains why the party believes that the Secretary should reverse or modify the decision of the hearing official.</P>

              <P>(ii) At the time the party files its appeal submission, the party shall provide a copy of that submission to the opposing party.<PRTPAGE P="468"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) The opposing party shall submit its brief or other responsive statement to the Secretary, with a copy to the appellant, within 30 days after the opposing party receives the appellant's brief or written statement.</P>
              <P>(iv) The appealing party may submit proposed findings of fact or conclusions of law. However, the proposed findings of fact must be supported by—</P>
              <P>(A) The evidence introduced into the record at the hearing;</P>
              <P>(B) Stipulations of the parties if the hearing consisted of written submissions; or</P>
              <P>(C) Matters that may be judicially noticed.</P>
              <P>(v) Neither party may introduce new evidence on appeal.</P>

              <P>(a) A ruling by a hearing official may not be appealed to the Secretary until the issuance of an initial decision, except that the Secretary may, at any time prior to the issuance of the initial decision, grant a review of a ruling upon either a certification by a hearing official of the ruling to the Secretary for review or the filing of a petition for review of a ruling by one or both of the parties, if—</P>
              <P>(1) That ruling involves a controlling question of substantive or procedural law; and</P>
              <P>(2) The immediate resolution of the question will materially advance the final disposition of the proceeding or subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) A petition for interlocutory review of an interim ruling must include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A brief statement of the facts necessary to an understanding of the issue on which review is sought.</P>
              <P>(ii) A statement of the issue.</P>
              <P>(iii) A statement of the reasons showing that the ruling complained of involves a controlling question of substantive or procedural law and why immediate review of the ruling will materially advance the disposition of the case, or why subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy.</P>
              <P>(2) A petition may not exceed ten pages, double-spaced, and must be filed with a copy of the ruling and any findings and opinions relating to the ruling.</P>
              <P>(c) A copy of the petition must be provided to the hearing official at the time of filing with the Secretary, and a copy of a petition or any certification must be served upon the parties as provided in § 668.92(a)(4). The petition or certification must reflect this service.</P>
              <P>(d) If a party files a petition under this section, the hearing official may state to the Secretary a view as to whether review is appropriate or inappropriate by submitting a brief statement addressing the party's petition within 10 days of the receipt of that petition by the hearing official. A copy of the statement must be served on all parties in the manner provided in § 668.91(a)(4)(ii).</P>
              <P>(e) A party's response to a petition or certification for interlocutory review must be filed within 7 days after service of the petition or statement, as applicable, and may not exceed 10 pages, double-spaced, in length. The response must be filed, and a copy served on the other party, as provided in § 668.91(a)(4).</P>
              <P>(f) The filing of a petition for interlocutory review does not automatically stay the proceedings. A stay during consideration of a petition for review may be granted by the hearing official if that official has certified or stated to the Secretary that review of the ruling is appropriate. The Secretary may order a stay of proceedings at any time after the filing of a request for interlocutory review.</P>

              <P>(g) The Secretary notifies the parties if a petition or certification for interlocutory review is accepted, and may provide the parties a reasonable time <PRTPAGE P="474"/>within which to submit written argument with regard to the merit of the petition or certification.</P>
              <P>(h) If the Secretary takes no action on a petition or certification for review within 15 days of receipt of it, the request is deemed to be denied.</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary may affirm, modify, set aside, or remand the interim ruling of the hearing official.</P>
              <P>(j) The Secretary may delegate to a designated department official the functions described in paragraphs (f) through (i) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Interlocutory appeals to the Secretary from rulings of a hearing official.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A ruling by a hearing official may not be appealed to the Secretary until the issuance of an initial decision, except that the Secretary may, at any time prior to the issuance of the initial decision, grant a review of a ruling upon either a certification by a hearing official of the ruling to the Secretary for review or the filing of a petition for review of a ruling by one or both of the parties, if—</P>
              <P>(1) That ruling involves a controlling question of substantive or procedural law; and</P>
              <P>(2) The immediate resolution of the question will materially advance the final disposition of the proceeding or subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) A petition for interlocutory review of an interim ruling must include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A brief statement of the facts necessary to an understanding of the issue on which review is sought.</P>
              <P>(ii) A statement of the issue.</P>
              <P>(iii) A statement of the reasons showing that the ruling complained of involves a controlling question of substantive or procedural law and why immediate review of the ruling will materially advance the disposition of the case, or why subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy.</P>
              <P>(2) A petition may not exceed ten pages, double-spaced, and must be filed with a copy of the ruling and any findings and opinions relating to the ruling.</P>
              <P>(c) A copy of the petition must be provided to the hearing official at the time of filing with the Secretary, and a copy of a petition or any certification must be served upon the parties as provided in § 668.122(a)(2). The petition or certification must reflect this service.</P>
              <P>(d) If a party files a petition under this section, the hearing official may state to the Secretary a view as to whether review is appropriate or inappropriate by submitting a brief statement addressing the party's petition within 10 days of the receipt of that petition by the hearing official. A copy of the statement must be served on all parties in the manner provided in § 668.122(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(e) A party's response to a petition or certification for interlocutory review must be filed within 7 days after service of the petition or statement, as applicable, and may not exceed 10 pages, double-spaced, in length. A copy of the response must be served on the parties and the hearing official as provided in § 668.122(a)(2).</P>

              <P>(f) The filing of a petition for interlocutory review does not automatically <PRTPAGE P="479"/>stay the proceedings. A stay during consideration of a petition for review may be granted by the hearing official if that official has certified or stated to the Secretary that review of the ruling is appropriate. The Secretary may order a stay of proceedings at any time after the filing of a request for interlocutory review.</P>
              <P>(g) The Secretary notifies the parties if a petition or certification for interlocutory review is accepted, and may provide the parties a reasonable time within which to submit written argument with regard to the merit of the petition or certification.</P>
              <P>(h) If the Secretary takes no action on a petition or certification for review within 15 days of receipt of it, the request is deemed to be denied.</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary may affirm, modify, set aside, or remand the interim ruling of the hearing official.</P>
              <P>(j) The Secretary may delegate to a designated department official the functions described in paragraphs (f) through (i) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test approval procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) When the Secretary receives a complete application from a test publisher or a State, the Secretary selects one or more experts in the field of educational testing and assessment, who possess appropriate advanced degrees and experience in test development or psychometric research, to determine whether the test meets the requirements for test approval contained in §§ 668.146, 668.147, 668.148, or 668.149, as appropriate, and to advise the Secretary of their determinations.</P>
              <P>(2) If the test involves a language other than English, the Secretary selects at least one individual who is fluent in the language in which the test is written to collaborate with the testing expert or experts described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and to advise the Secretary on whether the test meets the additional criteria, provisions, and conditions for test approval contained in §§ 668.148 and 668.149.</P>
              <P>(3) For test batteries that contain multiple sub-tests measuring content domains other than verbal and quantitative domains, the Secretary reviews only those sub-tests covering the verbal and quantitative domains.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) If the Secretary determines that a test satisfies the criteria and requirements for test approval, the Secretary notifies the test publisher or the State, as applicable, of the Secretary's decision, and publishes the name of the test and the passing scores in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary determines that a test does not satisfy the criteria and requirements for test approval, the Secretary notifies the test publisher or the State, as applicable, of the Secretary's decision, and the reasons why the test did not meet those criteria and requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Secretary determines that a test does not satisfy the criteria and requirements for test approval, the test publisher or the State that submitted the test for approval may request that the Secretary reevaluate the Secretary's decision. Such a request must be accompanied by—</P>
              <P>(i) Documentation and information that address the reasons for the non-approval of the test; and</P>
              <P>(ii) An analysis of why the information and documentation submitted meet the criteria and requirements for test approval notwithstanding the Secretary's earlier decision to the contrary.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) The Secretary approves a test for a period not to exceed five years from the date the notice of approval of the test is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary extends the approval period of a test to include the period of review if the test publisher or the State, as applicable, re-submits the test for review and approval under § 668.144 at least six months before the date on which the test approval is scheduled to expire.</P>

              <P>(d)(1) The Secretary's approval of a test may be revoked if the Secretary determines that the test publisher or the State violated any terms of the agreement described in § 668.150, that the information the test publisher or <PRTPAGE P="488"/>the State submitted as a basis for approval of the test was inaccurate, or that the test publisher or the State substantially changed the test and did not resubmit the test, as revised, for approval.</P>

              <P>(2) If the Secretary revokes approval of a previously approved test, the Secretary publishes a notice of that revocation in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The revocation becomes effective—</P>

              <P>(i) One hundred and twenty days from the date the notice of revocation is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>; or</P>

              <P>(i) On the date the Secretary approves the process; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Six months after the date on which the State submits the process to the Secretary for approval, if the Secretary neither approves nor disapproves the process during that six month period.</P>
              <P>(f) The Secretary approves a State process for a period not to exceed five years.</P>
              <P>(g)(1) The Secretary withdraws approval of a State process if the Secretary determines that the State process violated any terms of this section or that the information that the State submitted as a basis for approval of the State process was inaccurate.</P>

              <P>(iii) If the student did not withdraw but ceased to be enrolled as at least a half-time student, the institution may make the late disbursement of a loan under the Direct Loan program to pay for educational costs that the institution determines the student incurred for the period in which the student or parent was eligible.</P>

              <P>(6) For purposes of this section—</P>
              <P>(i) Affirmative confirmation is a process under which an institution obtains written confirmation of the types and amounts of title IV, HEA program loans that a student wants for the period of enrollment before the institution credits the student's account with those loan funds.

              <P>(3) The institution is able to meet all of its financial obligations and otherwise provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with title IV, HEA program requirements. An institution may not be able to meet its financial or administrative obligations if it is subject to an action or event described in paragraph (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section. The Secretary considers those actions or events in determining whether the institution is financially responsible only if they occur on or after July 1, 2017; and</P>
              <P>(4) The institution or persons affiliated with the institution are not subject to a condition of past performance under § 668.174(a) or (b).</P>

              <P>(C) If the court did not set a deadline for filing a motion for summary judgment and the institution did not file such a motion, the court has set a pretrial conference date or trial date and the case is pending on the earlier of those two dates.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Accrediting agency actions.</E> The institution was required by its accrediting agency to submit a teach-out plan, for a reason described in § 602.24(c)(1), that covers the closing of the institution or any of its branches or additional locations.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Gainful employment.</E> As determined annually by the Secretary, the institution has gainful employment programs that, under § 668.403, could become ineligible based on their final D/E rates for the next award year.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Withdrawal of owner's equity.</E> For a proprietary institution whose composite score is less than 1.5, any withdrawal of owner's equity from the institution by any means, including by declaring a dividend, unless the transfer is to an entity included in the affiliated entity group on whose basis the institution's composite score was calculated.</P>

              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Calculation of potential loss—other litigation.</E> For any suit described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the amount of loss is the amount set by a court ruling, or, in the absence of a court ruling—</P>

              </P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Letter of credit alternative for new institutions.</E> A new institution that is not financially responsible solely because the Secretary determines that its composite score is less than 1.5, qualifies as a financially responsible institution by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit, that is acceptable and payable to the Secretary, for an amount equal to at least one-half of the amount of title IV, HEA program funds that the Secretary determines the institution will receive during its initial year of participation. A new institution is an institution that seeks to participate for the first time in the title IV, HEA programs.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Letter of credit alternative for participating institutions.</E> A participating institution that is not financially responsible either because it does not satisfy one or more of the standards of financial responsibility under § 668.171(b) through (g), or because of an audit opinion described under § 668.171(j), qualifies as a financially responsible institution by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit or other form of financial protection specified by the Secretary in a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> that is acceptable and payable to the Secretary, for an amount determined by the Secretary that is not less than one-half of the title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Zone alternative.</E> (1) A participating institution that is not financially responsible solely because the Secretary determines that its composite score under § 668.172 is less than 1.5 may participate in the title IV, HEA programs as a financially responsible institution for no more than three consecutive years, beginning with the year in which the Secretary determines that the institution qualifies under this alternative.</P>
              <P>(i)(A) An institution qualifies initially under this alternative if, based on the institution's audited financial statement for its most recently completed fiscal year, the Secretary determines that its composite score is in the range from 1.0 to 1.4; and</P>

              <P>(B) An institution continues to qualify under this alternative if, based on the institution's audited financial statement for each of its subsequent two fiscal years, the Secretary determines that the institution's composite score is in the range from 1.0 to 1.4.<PRTPAGE P="519"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) An institution that qualified under this alternative for three consecutive years, or for one of those years, may not seek to qualify again under this alternative until the year after the institution achieves a composite score of at least 1.5, as determined by the Secretary.</P>

              <P>(B) Any losses that are unusual in nature or infrequently occur, or both, as defined in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 and ASC 225;</P>
              <P>(iii) May require the institution to submit its financial statement and compliance audits earlier than the time specified under § 668.23(a)(4); and</P>
              <P>(iv) May require the institution to provide information about its current operations and future plans.</P>

              <P>(i) The institution is not financially responsible because it does not satisfy the general standards under § 668.171(b)(1) or (3), its recalculated composite score under § 668.171(c)(2) is less than 1.0, is subject to an action or event under § 668.171(d), (e), (f),or (g) or because of an audit opinion described in § 668.171(i); or</P>
              <P>(ii) The institution is not financially responsible because of a condition of past performance, as provided under § 668.174(a), and the institution demonstrates to the Secretary that it has satisfied or resolved that condition.</P>
              <P>(2) Under this alternative, the institution must—</P>

              <P>(i) Provide to the Secretary an irrevocable letter of credit that is acceptable and payable to the Secretary, agree to a set-aside under paragraph (h) of this section, or, at the Secretary's discretion, provide another form of financial protection specified by the Secretary in a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> for an amount determined by the Secretary under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, except that this requirement does not apply to a public institution; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Comply with the provisions under the zone alternative, as provided under paragraph (d)(2) and (3).</P>

              </P>
              <P>(A) May require the institution, or one or more persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution, as determined under § 668.174(b)(1) and (c), or both, to provide to the Secretary financial protection for an amount determined by the Secretary under paragraph (f)(4) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(B) May require one or more of the persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution, as determined under § 668.174(b)(1) and (c), to be jointly or severally liable for any liabilities that may arise from the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs; and</P>
              <P>(ii) May permit the institution to continue to participate under a provisional certification but requires the institution to provide, or continue to provide, the financial protection resulting from an event described in § 668.171(c) through (g) until the institution meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) The institution must provide to the Secretary the financial protection described under paragraph (f)(2)(i) in an amount that, together with the amount of any financial protection that the institution has already provided if that protection covers the period described in paragraph (f)(5) of this section, equals, for a composite score calculated under § 668.172, a composite score recalculated under § 668.171(c)(2), or for any other reason that the institution is not financially responsible—</P>
              <P>(A) Ten percent of the total amount of title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year; and</P>
              <P>(B) Any additional amount that the Secretary demonstrates is needed under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary determines the amount specified in paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section that must be provided by the institution in addition to the amount specified in paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section, and must ensure that the total amount of financial protection provided under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section is sufficient to fully cover any estimated losses.

              <P>(5) The Secretary maintains the full amount of the financial protection provided by the institution under paragraph (f)(4) of this section until the Secretary first determines that the institution has—</P>
              <P>(i) A composite score of 1.0 or greater based on the review of the audited financial statements for the fiscal year in which all losses from any event described in § 668.171(c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) on which financial protection was required have been fully recognized; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A recalculated composite score of 1.0 or greater, and any event or condition described in § 668.171(d), (e), (f), or (g) has ceased to exist.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Provisional certification alternative for persons or entities owing liabilities.</E> (1) The Secretary may permit an institution that is not financially responsible because the persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution owe a liability for a violation of a title IV, HEA program requirement, to participate in the title IV, HEA programs under a provisional certification only if—</P>
              <P>(i)(A) The persons or entities that exercise substantial control, as determined under § 668.174(b)(1) and (c), repay or enter into an agreement with the Secretary to repay the applicable portion of that liability, as provided under § 668.174(b)(2)(ii); or</P>
              <P>(B) The institution assumes that liability, and repays or enters into an agreement with the Secretary to repay that liability;</P>
              <P>(ii) The institution satisfies the general standards and provisions of financial responsibility under § 668.171(b) and (d)(1), except that institution must demonstrate that it was current on its debt payments and has met all of its financial obligations, as required under § 668.171 (b)(3) and (b)(4), for its two most recent fiscal years; and</P>

              <P>(iii) The institution submits to the Secretary an irrevocable letter of credit that is acceptable and payable to the Secretary, for an amount determined by the Secretary that is not less than 10 percent of the title IV, HEA program <PRTPAGE P="521"/>funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(2) Under this alternative, the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(i) Requires the institution to comply with the provisions under the zone alternative, as provided under paragraph (d) (2) and (3) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) May require the institution, or one or more persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution, or both, to submit to the Secretary financial guarantees for an amount determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to satisfy any potential liabilities that may arise from the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs; and</P>
              <P>(iii) May require one or more of the persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution to be jointly or severally liable for any liabilities that may arise from the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Set-aside.</E> If an institution does not provide a letter of credit or financial protection acceptable to the Secretary for the amount required under paragraph (d) or (f) of this section within 45 days of the Secretary's request, the Secretary offsets the amount of title IV, HEA program funds that an institution is eligible to receive in a manner that ensures that, no later than the end of a nine-month period, the total amount offset equals the amount of financial protection the institution would otherwise provide. The Secretary uses the funds to satisfy the debt and liabilities owed to the Secretary that are not otherwise paid directly by the institution, and provides to the institution any funds not used for this purpose during the period for which the financial protection was required, or provides the institution any remaining funds if the institution subsequently submits the financial protection originally required under paragraph (d) or (f) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Your cohort default rate is a measure we use to determine your eligibility to participate in various Title IV, HEA programs. We may also use it for determining your eligibility for exemptions, such as those for certain disbursement requirements under the FFEL and Direct Loan Programs. This subpart applies solely to cohorts, as defined in §§ 668.182(a) and 668.183(b), for fiscal years through 2011. For these cohorts, this subpart describes how cohort default rates are calculated, some of the consequences of cohort default rates, and how you may request changes to your cohort default rates or appeal their consequences. Under this subpart, you submit a “challenge” after you receive your draft cohort default rate, and you request an “adjustment” or “appeal” after your official cohort default rate is published.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Cohort Default Rates.</E> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subpart, we will issue annually <PRTPAGE P="530"/>two sets of draft and official cohort default rates for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011.

              <SUBJECT>Calculating and applying cohort default rates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section describes the four steps that we follow to calculate and apply your cohort default rate for a fiscal year:</P>
              <P>(1) First, under paragraph (b) of this section, we identify the borrowers in your cohort for the fiscal year. If the total number of borrowers in that cohort is fewer than 30, we also identify the borrowers in your cohorts for the 2 most recent prior fiscal years.</P>

              <P>(2) Second, under paragraph (c) of this section, we identify the borrowers in the cohort (or cohorts) who are considered to be in default. If more than one cohort will be used to calculate your cohort default rate, we identify defaulted borrowers separately for each cohort.<PRTPAGE P="531"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Third, under paragraph (d) of this section, we calculate your cohort default rate.</P>
              <P>(4) Fourth, we apply your cohort default rate to all of your locations—</P>
              <P>(i) As you exist on the date you receive the notice of your official cohort default rate; and</P>
              <P>(ii) From the date on which you receive the notice of your official cohort default rate until you receive our notice that the cohort default rate no longer applies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Identify the borrowers in a cohort.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, your cohort for a fiscal year consists of all of your current and former students who, during that fiscal year, entered repayment on any Federal Stafford loan, Federal SLS loan, Direct Subsidized loan, or Direct Unsubsidized loan that they received to attend your institution, or on the portion of a loan made under the Federal Consolidation Loan Program or the Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program (as defined in 34 CFR 685.102) that is used to repay those loans.</P>
              <P>(2) A borrower may be included in more than one of your cohorts and may be included in the cohorts of more than one institution in the same fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(3) A TEACH Grant that has been converted to a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan is not considered for the purpose of calculating and applying cohort default rates.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Identify the borrowers in a cohort who are in default.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for the purposes of this subpart a borrower in a cohort for a fiscal year is considered to be in default if—</P>
              <P>(i) Before the end of the following fiscal year, the borrower defaults on any FFELP loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort or on any Federal Consolidation Loan Program loan that repaid a loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort (however, a borrower is not considered to be in default unless a claim for insurance has been paid on the loan by a guaranty agency or by us);</P>
              <P>(ii) Before the end of the following fiscal year, the borrower fails to make an installment payment, when due, on any Direct Loan Program loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort or on any Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program loan that repaid a loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort, and the borrower's failure persists for 360 days (or for 270 days, if the borrower's first day of delinquency was before October 7, 1998);</P>
              <P>(iii) Before the end of the following fiscal year, you or your owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other affiliated entity or individual make a payment to prevent a borrower's default on a loan that is used to include the borrower in that cohort: or</P>
              <P>(iv) Before the end of the following fiscal year, the borrower fails to make an installment payment, when due, on a Federal Stafford Loan that is held by the Secretary or a Federal Consolidation Loan that is held by the Secretary and was used to repay a Federal Stafford Loan, if such Federal Stafford Loan or Federal Consolidation Loan was used to include the borrower in the cohort, and the borrower's failure persists for 360 days.</P>
              <P>(2) A borrower is not considered to be in default based on a loan that is, before the end of the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which it entered repayment—</P>
              <P>(i) Rehabilitated under 34 CFR 682.405 or 34 CFR 685.211(e); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Repurchased by a lender because the claim for insurance was submitted or paid in error.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Calculate the cohort default rate.</E> Except as provided in § 668.184, if there are—</P>
              <P>(1) Thirty or more borrowers in your cohort for a fiscal year, your cohort default rate is the percentage that is derived by dividing—</P>
              <P>(i) The number of borrowers in the cohort who are in default, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section; by</P>
              <P>(ii) The number of borrowers in the cohort, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Fewer than 30 borrowers in your cohort for a fiscal year, your cohort default rate is the percentage that is derived by dividing—</P>

              <P>(i) The total number of borrowers in that cohort and in the two most recent <PRTPAGE P="532"/>prior cohorts who are in default, as determined for each cohort under paragraph (c) of this section; by</P>
              <P>(ii) The total number of borrowers in that cohort and the two most recent prior cohorts, as determined for each cohort under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Except as provided under 34 CFR 600.32(d), if you undergo a change in status identified in this section, your cohort default rate is determined under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) In determining cohort default rates under this section, the date of a merger, acquisition, or other change in status is the date the change occurs.</P>
              <P>(3) A change in status may affect your eligibility to participate in Title IV, HEA programs under § 668.187 or § 668.188.</P>
              <P>(4) If another institution's cohort default rate is applicable to you under this section, you may challenge, request an adjustment, or submit an appeal for the cohort default rate under the same requirements that would be applicable to the other institution under §§ 668.185 and 668.189.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acquisition or merger of institutions.</E> If your institution acquires, or was created by the merger of, one or more institutions that participated independently in the Title IV, HEA programs immediately before the acquisition or merger—</P>
              <P>(1) For the cohort default rates published before the date of the acquisition or merger, your cohort default rates are the same as those of your predecessor that had the highest total number of borrowers entering repayment in the two most recent cohorts used to calculate those cohort default rates; and</P>
              <P>(2) Beginning with the first cohort default rate published after the date of the acquisition or merger, your cohort default rates are determined by including the applicable borrowers from each institution involved in the acquisition or merger in the calculation under § 668.183.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Acquisition of branches or locations.</E> If you acquire a branch or a location from another institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs—</P>

              <P>(2) Beginning with the first cohort default rate published after the date of the change, your cohort default rates for the next 3 fiscal years are determined by including the applicable borrowers from your institution and the other institution (including all of its locations) in the calculation under § 668.183;</P>
              <P>(3) After the period described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, your cohort default rates do not include borrowers from the other institution in the calculation under § 668.183; and</P>
              <P>(4) At all times, the cohort default rate for the institution from which you acquired the branch or location is not affected by this change in status.</P>

              <P>(2) Regardless of the number of borrowers included in your cohort, your draft cohort default rate is always calculated using data for that fiscal year alone, using the method described in § 668.183(d)(1).</P>
              <P>(3) Your draft cohort default rate and the loan record detail report are not considered public information and may not be otherwise voluntarily released to the public by a data manager.</P>
              <P>(4) Any challenge you submit under this section and any response provided by a data manager must be in a format acceptable to us. This acceptable format is described in the “Cohort Default Rate Guide” that we provide to you. If your challenge does not comply with the requirements in the “Cohort Default Rate Guide,” we may deny your challenge.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Incorrect data challenges.</E> (1) You may challenge the accuracy of the data included on the loan record detail report by sending a challenge to the relevant data manager, or data managers, within 45 days after you receive the data. Your challenge must include—</P>
              <P>(i) A description of the information in the loan record detail report that you believe is incorrect; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Documentation that supports your contention that the data are incorrect.</P>
              <P>(2) Within 30 days after receiving your challenge, the data manager must send you and us a response that—</P>
              <P>(i) Addresses each of your allegations of error; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Includes the documentation that supports the data manager's position.</P>
              <P>(3) If your data manager concludes that draft data in the loan record detail report are incorrect, and we agree, we use the corrected data to calculate your cohort default rate.</P>
              <P>(4) If you fail to challenge the accuracy of data under this section, you cannot contest the accuracy of those data in an uncorrected data adjustment, under § 668.190, or in an erroneous data appeal, under § 668.192.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Participation rate index challenges.</E> (1)(i) You may challenge an anticipated loss of eligibility under § 668.187(a)(1), based on one cohort default rate over 40 percent, if your participation rate index for that cohort's fiscal year is equal to or less than 0.06015.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may challenge an anticipated loss of eligibility under § 668.187(a)(2), based on three cohort default rates of 25 percent or greater, if your participation rate index is equal to or less than 0.0375 for any of those three cohorts' fiscal years.</P>
              <P>(2) For a participation rate index challenge, your participation rate index is calculated as described in § 668.195(b), except that—</P>
              <P>(i) The draft cohort default rate is considered to be your most recent cohort default rate; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If the cohort used to calculate your draft cohort default rate included fewer than 30 borrowers, you may calculate your participation rate index for that fiscal year using either your most recent draft cohort default rate or the average rate that would be calculated for that fiscal year, using the method described in § 668.183(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(3) You must send your participation rate index challenge, including all supporting documentation, to us within 45 days after you receive your draft cohort default rate.</P>
              <P>(4) We notify you of our determination on your participation rate index challenge before your official cohort default rate is published.</P>

              <P>(5) If we determine that you qualify for continued eligibility based on your participation rate index challenge, you will not lose eligibility under § 668.187 when your next official cohort default <PRTPAGE P="534"/>rate is published. A successful challenge that is based on your draft cohort default rate does not excuse you from any other loss of eligibility. However, if your successful challenge of a loss of eligibility under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is based on a prior, official cohort default rate, and not on your draft cohort default rate, we also excuse you from any subsequent loss of eligibility, under § 668.187(a)(2), that would be based on that official cohort default rate.</P>

              <P>(2) Following the change described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you offer an educational program at substantially the same address at which the ineligible institution had offered an educational program before the change; and</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Commonality of ownership or management.</E> For the purposes of this section, a commonality of ownership or management exists if, at each institution, the same person (as defined in 34 CFR 600.31) or members of that person's family, directly or indirectly—</P>
              <P>(1) Holds or held a managerial role; or</P>

              <P>(ii) We determine that the commonality of management, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, has ended; or</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Within 30 days after you receive our notice that we have denied your submission under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, you make the management changes we request and send us a list of the names of the managers for each facility undergoing the teach-out as it exists after you make those changes; and</P>

              <P>(2) Our notice also advises you of the scope and duration of your loss of eligibility. The loss of eligibility applies to all of your locations from the date you receive our notice until the expiration of the period of ineligibility applicable to the other institution.</P>
              <P>(3) If you are subject to a loss of eligibility under this section that has already been imposed against another institution, you may only request an adjustment or submit an appeal for the loss of eligibility under the same requirements that would be applicable to the other institution under § 668.189.</P>

              <P>(3) Within 20 days after receiving your request for loan servicing records, the data manager must—</P>
              <P>(i) Send you and us a list of the borrowers in your representative sample, as described in paragraph (d) of this section (the list must be in social security number order, and it must include the number of defaulted loans included in the cohort for each listed borrower);</P>
              <P>(ii) Send you and us a description of how your representative sample was chosen; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Either send you copies of the loan servicing records for the borrowers in your representative sample and send us a copy of its cover letter indicating that the records were sent, or send you and us a notice of the amount of its fee for providing copies of the loan servicing records.</P>
              <P>(4) The data manager may charge you a reasonable fee for providing copies of loan servicing records, but it may not charge more than $10 per borrower file. If a data manager charges a fee, it is not required to send the documents to you until it receives your payment of the fee.</P>
              <P>(5) If the data manager charges a fee for providing copies of loan servicing records, you must send payment in full to the data manager within 15 days after you receive the notice of the fee.</P>
              <P>(6) If the data manager charges a fee for providing copies of loan servicing records, and—</P>
              <P>(i) You pay the fee in full and on time, the data manager must send you, within 20 days after it receives your payment, a copy of all loan servicing records for each loan in your representative sample (the copies are provided to you in hard copy format unless the data manager and you agree that another format may be used), and it must send us a copy of its cover letter indicating that the records were sent; or</P>
              <P>(ii) You do not pay the fee in full and on time, the data manager must notify you and us of your failure to pay the fee and that you have waived your right to challenge the calculation of your cohort default rate based on the data manager's records. We accept that determination unless you prove that it is incorrect.</P>
              <P>(7) Within 15 days after receiving a guaranty agency's notice that we hold an FFELP loan about which you are inquiring, you must send us your request for the loan servicing records for that loan. We respond to your request under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) Within 15 days after receiving incomplete or illegible records, you must send a request for replacement records to the data manager and us.</P>
              <P>(9) Within 20 days after receiving your request for replacement records, the data manager must either—</P>
              <P>(i) Replace the missing or illegible records; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Notify you and us that no additional or improved copies are available.</P>
              <P>(10) You must send your appeal to us, including all supporting documentation—</P>

              <P>(i) Within 30 days after you receive the final data manager's response to <PRTPAGE P="541"/>your request for loan servicing records; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If you are also requesting a new data adjustment or filing an erroneous data appeal, by the latest of the filing dates required in paragraph (c)(10)(i) of this section or in § 668.191(b)(6)(i) or § 668.192(b)(6)(i).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Representative sample of records.</E> (1) To select a representative sample of records, the data manager first identifies all of the borrowers for whom it is responsible and who had loans that were considered to be in default in the calculation of the cohort default rate you are appealing.</P>
              <P>(2) From the group of borrowers identified under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the data manager identifies a sample that is large enough to derive an estimate, acceptable at a 95 percent confidence level with a plus or minus 5 percent confidence interval, for use in determining the number of borrowers who should be excluded from the calculation of the cohort default rate due to improper loan servicing or collection.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Loan servicing records.</E> Loan servicing records are the collection and payment history records—</P>
              <P>(1) Provided to the guaranty agency by the lender and used by the guaranty agency in determining whether to pay a claim on a defaulted loan; or</P>
              <P>(2) Maintained by our Direct Loan Servicer that are used in determining your cohort default rate.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Determination.</E> (1) We determine the number of loans, included in your representative sample of loan servicing records, that defaulted due to improper loan servicing or collection, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Based on our determination, we use a statistically valid methodology to exclude the corresponding percentage of borrowers from both the numerator and denominator of the calculation of your cohort default rate, and electronically correct the rate that is publicly released.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose of this subpart.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Your cohort default rate is a measure we use to determine your eligibility to participate in various Title IV, HEA programs. We may also use it for determining your eligibility for exemptions, such as those for certain disbursement requirements under the FFEL and Direct Loan Programs. This subpart applies solely to cohorts, as defined in §§ 668.201(a) and 668.202(b), for fiscal years 2009 and later. For these cohorts, this subpart describes how cohort default rates are calculated, some of the consequences of cohort default rates, and how you may request changes to your cohort default rates or appeal their consequences. Under this subpart, you submit a “challenge” after you receive your draft cohort default rate, and you request an “adjustment” or “appeal” after your official cohort default rate is published.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Cohort Default Rates.</E> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subpart, we will issue annually two sets of draft and official cohort default rates for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011. For each of these years, you will receive one set of draft and official cohort default rates under this subpart and another set of draft and official cohort default rates under subpart M of this part.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Entering repayment.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, loans are considered to enter repayment on the dates described in 34 CFR 682.200 (under the definition of “repayment period”) and in 34 CFR 685.207.</P>
              <P>(2) A Federal SLS loan is considered to enter repayment—</P>

              <P>(ii) In all other cases, on the day after the student ceases to be enrolled at an institution on at least a half-time basis in an educational program leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential.</P>
              <P>(3) For the purposes of this subpart, a loan is considered to enter repayment on the date that a borrower repays it in full, if the loan is paid in full before the loan enters repayment under paragraphs (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Calculating and applying cohort default rates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section describes the four steps that we follow to calculate and apply your cohort default rate for a fiscal year:</P>
              <P>(1) First, under paragraph (b) of this section, we identify the borrowers in your cohort for the fiscal year. If the total number of borrowers in that cohort is fewer than 30, we also identify the borrowers in your cohorts for the 2 most recent prior fiscal years.</P>
              <P>(2) Second, under paragraph (c) of this section, we identify the borrowers in the cohort (or cohorts) who are considered to be in default by the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year those borrowers entered repayment. If more than one cohort will be used to calculate your cohort default rate, we identify defaulted borrowers separately for each cohort.</P>
              <P>(3) Third, under paragraph (d) of this section, we calculate your cohort default rate.</P>
              <P>(4) Fourth, we apply your cohort default rate to all of your locations—</P>
              <P>(i) As you exist on the date you receive the notice of your official cohort default rate; and</P>
              <P>(ii) From the date on which you receive the notice of your official cohort default rate until you receive our notice that the cohort default rate no longer applies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Identify the borrowers in a cohort.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, your cohort for a fiscal year consists of all of your current and former students who, during that fiscal year, entered repayment on any Federal Stafford loan, Federal SLS loan, Direct Subsidized loan, or Direct Unsubsidized loan that they received to attend your institution, or on the portion of a loan made under the Federal Consolidation Loan Program or the Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program (as defined in 34 CFR 685.102) that is used to repay those loans.</P>
              <P>(2) A borrower may be included in more than one of your cohorts and may be included in the cohorts of more than one institution in the same fiscal year.</P>

              <P>(3) A TEACH Grant that has been converted to a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan is not considered for the purpose of calculating and applying cohort default rates.<PRTPAGE P="546"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Identify the borrowers in a cohort who are in default.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a borrower in a cohort for a fiscal year is considered to be in default if, before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year the borrower entered repayment—</P>
              <P>(i) The borrower defaults on any FFELP loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort or on any Federal Consolidation Loan Program loan that repaid a loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort (however, a borrower is not considered to be in default unless a claim for insurance has been paid on the loan by a guaranty agency or by us);</P>
              <P>(ii) The borrower fails to make an installment payment, when due, on any Direct Loan Program loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort or on any Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program loan that repaid a loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort, and the borrower's failure persists for 360 days (or for 270 days, if the borrower's first day of delinquency was before October 7, 1998);</P>
              <P>(iii) You or your owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other affiliated entity or individual make a payment to prevent a borrower's default on a loan that is used to include the borrower in that cohort; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The borrower fails to make an installment payment, when due, on a Federal Stafford Loan that is held by the Secretary or a Federal Consolidation Loan that is held by the Secretary and that was used to repay a Federal Stafford Loan, if such Federal Stafford Loan or Federal Consolidation was used to include the borrower in the cohort, and the borrower's failure persists for 360 days.</P>
              <P>(2) A borrower is not considered to be in default based on a loan that is, before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which it entered repayment—</P>
              <P>(i) Rehabilitated under 34 CFR 682.405 or 34 CFR 685.211(e); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Repurchased by a lender because the claim for insurance was submitted or paid in error.</P>
              <P>(d) Calculate the cohort default rate. Except as provided in § 668.203, if there are—</P>
              <P>(1)(i) Thirty or more borrowers in your cohort for a fiscal year, your cohort default rate is the percentage that is calculated by—</P>
              <P>(ii) Dividing the number of borrowers in the cohort who are in default, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section by the number of borrowers in the cohort, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Fewer than 30 borrowers in your cohort for a fiscal year, your cohort default rate is the percentage that is calculated by—</P>
              <P>(ii) Dividing the total number of borrowers in that cohort and in the two most recent prior cohorts who are in default, as determined for each cohort under paragraph (c) of this section by the total number of borrowers in that cohort and the two most recent prior cohorts, as determined for each cohort under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Except as provided under 34 CFR 600.32(d), if you undergo a change in status identified in this section, your cohort default rate is determined under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) In determining cohort default rates under this section, the date of a merger, acquisition, or other change in status is the date the change occurs.</P>
              <P>(3) A change in status may affect your eligibility to participate in Title IV, HEA programs under § 668.206 or § 668.207.</P>
              <P>(4) If another institution's cohort default rate is applicable to you under this section, you may challenge, request an adjustment, or submit an appeal for the cohort default rate under the same requirements that would be applicable to the other institution under §§ 668.204 and 668.208.</P>

              <P>(1) For the cohort default rates published before the date of the acquisition or merger, your cohort default rates are the same as those of your predecessor that had the highest total number of borrowers entering repayment in the two most recent cohorts used to calculate those cohort default rates; and</P>
              <P>(2) Beginning with the first cohort default rate published after the date of the acquisition or merger, your cohort default rates are determined by including the applicable borrowers from each institution involved in the acquisition or merger in the calculation under § 668.202.</P>

              <P>(2) Beginning with the first cohort default rate published after the date of the change, your cohort default rates for the next 3 fiscal years are determined by including the applicable borrowers from your institution and the other institution (including all of its locations) in the calculation under § 668.202;</P>
              <P>(3) After the period described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, your cohort default rates do not include borrowers from the other institution in the calculation under § 668.202; and</P>
              <P>(4) At all times, the cohort default rate for the institution from which you acquired the branch or location is not affected by this change in status.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) We notify you of your draft cohort default rate before your official cohort default rate is calculated. Our notice includes the loan record detail report for the draft cohort default rate.</P>
              <P>(2) Regardless of the number of borrowers included in your cohort, your draft cohort default rate is always calculated using data for that fiscal year alone, using the method described in § 668.202(d)(1).</P>
              <P>(3) Your draft cohort default rate and the loan record detail report are not considered public information and may not be otherwise voluntarily released to the public by a data manager.</P>
              <P>(4) Any challenge you submit under this section and any response provided by a data manager must be in a format acceptable to us. This acceptable format is described in the “Cohort Default Rate Guide” that we provide to you.

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Incorrect data challenges.</E> (1) You may challenge the accuracy of the data included on the loan record detail report by sending a challenge to the relevant data manager, or data managers, within 45 days after you receive the data. Your challenge must include—</P>
              <P>(i) A description of the information in the loan record detail report that you believe is incorrect; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Documentation that supports your contention that the data are incorrect.</P>

              <P>(2) Within 30 days after receiving your challenge, the data manager must send you and us a response that—<PRTPAGE P="548"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Addresses each of your allegations of error; and</P>

              <P>(3) If your data manager concludes that draft data in the loan record detail report are incorrect, and we agree, we use the corrected data to calculate your cohort default rate.</P>
              <P>(4) If you fail to challenge the accuracy of data under this section, you cannot contest the accuracy of those data in an uncorrected data adjustment, under § 668.209, or in an erroneous data appeal, under § 668.211.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Participation rate index challenges.</E> (1)(i) You may challenge an anticipated loss of eligibility under § 668.206(a)(1), based on one cohort default rate over 40 percent, if your participation rate index for that cohort's fiscal year is equal to or less than 0.0832.</P>
              <P>(ii) Subject to § 668.208(b), you may challenge a potential loss of eligibility under § 668.206(a)(2), based on any cohort default rate that is less than or equal to 40 percent, but greater than or equal to 30 percent, for any of the three most recently calculated fiscal years, if your participation rate index is equal to or less than 0.0625 for that cohort's fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(iii) You may challenge a potential placement on provisional certification under § 668.16(m)(2)(i), based on any cohort default rate that fails to satisfy the standard of administrative capability in § 668.16(m)(1)(ii), if your participation rate index is equal to or less than 0.0625 for that cohort's fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(2) For a participation rate index challenge, your participation rate index is calculated as described in § 668.214(b), except that—</P>
              <P>(i) The draft cohort default rate is considered to be your most recent cohort default rate; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If the cohort used to calculate your draft cohort default rate included fewer than 30 borrowers, you may calculate your participation rate index for that fiscal year using either your most recent draft cohort default rate or the average rate that would be calculated for that fiscal year, using the method described in § 668.202(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(3) You must send your participation rate index challenge, including all supporting documentation, to us within 45 days after you receive your draft cohort default rate.</P>
              <P>(4) We notify you of our determination on your participation rate index challenge before your official cohort default rate is published.</P>
              <P>(5) If we determine that you qualify for continued eligibility or full certification based on your participation rate index challenge, you will not lose eligibility under § 668.206 or be placed on provisional certification under § 668.16(m)(2)(i) when your next official cohort default rate is published. Unless that next official cohort default rate is less than or equal to your draft cohort default rate, a successful challenge that is based on your draft cohort default rate does not excuse you from any other loss of eligibility or placement on provisional certification. However, if your successful challenge under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section is based on a prior, official cohort default rate, and not on your draft cohort default rate, or if the next official cohort default rate published is less than or equal to the draft rate you successfully challenged, we also excuse you from any subsequent loss of eligibility, under § 668.206(a)(2), or placement on provisional certification, under § 668.16(m)(2)(i), that would be based on that official cohort default rate.</P>

              <P>(ii) You do not pay the fee in full and on time, the data manager must notify you and us of your failure to pay the fee and that you have waived your right to challenge the calculation of your cohort default rate based on the data manager's records. We accept that determination unless you prove that it is incorrect.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Loan servicing records.</E> Loan servicing records are the collection and payment history records—</P>

              <P>This subpart establishes regulations that apply to an institution that offers comprehensive transition and postsecondary programs to students with intellectual disabilities. Students enrolled in these programs are eligible for Federal financial assistance under the Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG, and FWS programs. Except for provisions related to needs analysis, the Secretary may waive any Title IV, HEA program requirement related to the Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG, and FWS programs or institutional eligibility, to ensure that students with intellectual disabilities remain eligible for funds under these assistance programs. However, unless provided in this subpart or subsequently waived by the Secretary, students with intellectual disabilities and institutions that offer comprehensive transition and postsecondary programs are subject to the same regulations and procedures that otherwise apply to Title IV, HEA program participants.</P>

              <P>(1) Creating a list of the students who completed the program during the cohort period and providing the list to the institution, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section;</P>
              <P>(2) Allowing the institution to correct the information about the students on the list, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section;</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Creating the list of students.</E> (1) The Secretary selects the students to be included on the list by—</P>

              <P>(i) Identifying the students who completed the program during the cohort <PRTPAGE P="567"/>period from the data provided by the institution under § 668.411; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Indicating which students would be removed from the list under § 668.404(e) and the specific reason for the exclusion.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary provides the list to the institution and states which cohort period was used to select the students.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Institutional corrections to the list.</E> (1) The Secretary presumes that the list of students and the identity information for those students are correct unless, as set forth in procedures established by the Secretary, the institution provides evidence to the contrary satisfactory to the Secretary. The institution bears the burden of proof that the list is incorrect.</P>
              <P>(2) No later than 45 days after the date the Secretary provides the list to the institution, the institution may—</P>
              <P>(i) Provide evidence showing that a student should be included on or removed from the list pursuant to § 668.404(e); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Correct or update a student's identity information and the student's program attendance information.</P>
              <P>(3) After the 45-day period expires, the institution may no longer seek to correct the list of students or revise the identity or program information of those students included on the list.</P>
              <P>(4) The Secretary considers the evidence provided by the institution and either accepts the correction or notifies the institution of the reasons for not accepting the correction. If the Secretary accepts the correction, the Secretary uses the corrected information to create the final list. The Secretary provides the institution with the final list and indicates the cohort period or cohort periods used to create the final list.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Obtaining earnings data.</E> The Secretary submits the final list to SSA. For the purposes of this section, SSA returns to the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(1) The mean and median annual earnings of the students on the list whom SSA has matched to SSA earnings data, in aggregate and not in individual form; and</P>
              <P>(2) The number, but not the identities, of students on the list that SSA could not match.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Calculating draft D/E rates.</E> (1)(i) If the SSA earnings data includes reports from records of earnings on at least 30 students, the Secretary uses the higher of the mean or median annual earnings provided by SSA to calculate draft D/E rates for a GE program, as provided in § 668.404.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the SSA earnings data includes reports from records of earnings on fewer than 30 but at least 10 students, the Secretary uses the earnings provided by SSA only for the purpose of disclosure under § 668.412(a)(13).</P>
              <P>(2) If SSA reports that it was unable to match one or more of the students on the final list, the Secretary does not include in the calculation of the median loan debt the same number of students with the highest loan debts as the number of students whose earnings SSA did not match. For example, if SSA is unable to match three students out of 100 students, the Secretary orders by amount the debts of the 100 listed students and excludes from the D/E rates calculation the three largest loan debts.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) The Secretary notifies the institution of the draft D/E rates for the program and provides the mean and median annual earnings obtained from SSA and the individual student loan information used to calculate the rates, including the loan debt that was used in the calculation for each student.</P>
              <P>(ii) The draft D/E rates and the data described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section are not considered public information.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Institutional challenges to draft D/E rates.</E> (1) The Secretary presumes that the loan debt information used to calculate the median loan debt for the program under § 668.404 is correct unless the institution provides evidence satisfactory to the Secretary, as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, that the information is incorrect. The institution bears the burden of proof to show that the loan debt information is incorrect and to show how it should be corrected.</P>

              <P>(2) No later than 45 days after the Secretary notifies an institution of the draft D/E rates for a program, the institution may challenge the accuracy of the loan debt information that the <PRTPAGE P="568"/>Secretary used to calculate the median loan debt for the program under § 668.404 by submitting evidence, in a format and through a process determined by the Secretary, that demonstrates that the median loan debt calculated by the Secretary is incorrect.</P>
              <P>(3) In a challenge under this section, the Secretary does not consider—</P>
              <P>(i) Any objection to the mean or median annual earnings that SSA provided to the Secretary;</P>
              <P>(ii) More than one challenge to the student-specific data on which draft D/E rates are based for a program for an award year; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Any challenge that is not timely submitted.</P>
              <P>(4) The Secretary considers the evidence provided by an institution challenging the median loan debt and notifies the institution of whether the challenge is accepted or the reasons why the challenge is not accepted.</P>
              <P>(5) If the information from an accepted challenge changes the median loan debt of the program, the Secretary recalculates the program's draft D/E rates.</P>
              <P>(6) Except as provided under § 668.406, an institution that does not timely challenge the draft D/E rates for a program waives any objection to those rates.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Final D/E rates.</E> (1) After expiration of the 45-day period and subject to resolution of any challenge under paragraph (f) of this section, a program's draft D/E rates constitute its final D/E rates.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary informs the institution of the final D/E rates for each of its GE programs by issuing the notice of determination described in § 668.409(a).</P>
              <P>(3) After the Secretary provides the notice of determination to the institution, the Secretary may publish the final D/E rates for the program.</P>

              <SUBJECT>D/E rates alternate earnings appeals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> If a GE program is failing or in the zone under the D/E rates measure, an institution may file an alternate earnings appeal to request recalculation of the program's most recent final D/E rates issued by the Secretary. The alternate earnings must be from the same calendar year for which the Secretary obtained earnings data from SSA to calculate the final D/E rates under § 668.404.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Basis for appeals.</E> (1) The institution may use alternate earnings from an institutional survey conducted under paragraph (c) of this section, or from a State-sponsored data system under paragraph (d) of this section, to recalculate the program's final D/E rates and file an appeal if by using the alternate earnings—</P>
              <P>(i) For a program that was failing the D/E rates measure, the program is passing or in the zone with respect to the D/E rates measure; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For a program that was in the zone for the purpose of the D/E rates measure, the program is passing the D/E rates measure.</P>
              <P>(2) When submitting its appeal of the final D/E rates, the institution must—</P>
              <P>(i) Use the annual loan payment used in the calculation of the final D/E rates; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Use the higher of the mean or median alternate earnings.</P>
              <P>(3) The institution must include in its appeal the alternate earnings of all the students who completed the program during the same cohort period that the Secretary used to calculate the final D/E rates under § 668.404 or a comparable cohort period, provided that the institution may elect—</P>
              <P>(i) If conducting an alternate earnings survey, to exclude from the survey, in accordance with the standards established by NCES, all or some of the students excluded from the D/E rates calculation under § 668.404(e); or</P>

              <P>(ii) If obtaining annual earnings data from one or more State-sponsored data systems, and in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, to exclude <PRTPAGE P="569"/>from the list of students submitted to the administrator of the State-administered data system all or some of the students excluded from the D/E rates calculation under § 668.404(e).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Survey requirements for appeals.</E> An institution must—</P>

              <P>(1) In accordance with the standards included on an Earnings Survey Form developed by NCES, conduct a survey to obtain annual earnings information of the students described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The Secretary will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> the Earnings Survey Form that will include a pilot-tested universe survey as well as the survey standards. An institution is not required to use the Earnings Survey Form but, in conducting a survey under this section, must adhere to the survey standards and present to the survey respondent in the same order and same manner the same survey items, included in the Earnings Survey Form; and</P>
              <P>(2) Submit to the Secretary as part of its appeal—</P>
              <P>(i) A certification signed by the institution's chief executive officer attesting that the survey was conducted in accordance with the survey standards in the Earnings Survey Form, and that the mean or median earnings used to recalculate the D/E rates was accurately determined from the survey results;</P>

              <P>(ii) An examination-level attestation engagement report prepared by an independent public accountant or independent governmental auditor, as appropriate, that the survey was conducted in accordance with the requirements set forth in the NCES Earnings Survey Form. The attestation must be conducted in accordance with the attestation standards contained in the Government Accountability Office's Government Auditing Standards promulgated by the Comptroller General of the United States (available at <E T="03">www.gao.gov/yellowbook/overview</E> or its successor site), and with procedures for attestations contained in guides developed by and available from the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Supporting documentation requested by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">State-sponsored data system requirements for appeals.</E> An institution must—</P>
              <P>(1) Obtain annual earnings data from one or more State-sponsored data systems by submitting a list of the students described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section to the administrator of each State-sponsored data system used for the appeal;</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that annual earnings data were obtained for more than 50 percent of the number of students in the cohort period not excluded pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and that number of students must be 30 or more; and</P>
              <P>(3) Submit as part of its appeal—</P>
              <P>(i) A certification signed by the institution's chief executive officer attesting that it accurately used the State-provided earnings data to recalculate the D/E rates; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Supporting documentation requested by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeals procedure.</E> (1) For any appeal under this section, in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary and provided in the notice of draft D/E rates under § 668.405 and the notice of determination under § 668.409, the institution must—</P>
              <P>(i) Notify the Secretary of its intent to submit an appeal no earlier than the date that the Secretary provides the institution the draft D/E rates under § 668.405(e)(3), but no later than 14 days after the date the Secretary issues the notice of determination under § 668.409(a) informing the institution of the final D/E rates under § 668.405(g); and</P>
              <P>(ii) Submit the recalculated D/E rates, all certifications, and specified supporting documentation related to the appeal no later than 60 days after the date the Secretary issues the notice of determination.</P>
              <P>(2) An institution that timely submits an appeal that meets the requirements of this section is not subject to any consequences under § 668.410 based on the D/E rates under appeal while the Secretary considers the appeal. If the Secretary has published final D/E rates under § 668.405(g), the program's final D/E rates will be annotated to indicate that they are under appeal.</P>

              <P>(3) An institution that does not submit a timely appeal waives its right to <PRTPAGE P="570"/>appeal the GE program's failing or zone D/E rates for the relevant award year.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Appeals determinations.</E> (1) <E T="03">Appeals denied.</E> If the Secretary denies an appeal, the Secretary notifies the institution of the reasons for denying the appeal, and the program's final D/E rates previously issued in the notice of determination under § 668.409(a) remain the final D/E rates for the program for the award year.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Appeals granted.</E> If the Secretary grants the appeal, the Secretary notifies the institution that the appeal is granted, that the recalculated D/E rates are the new final D/E rates for the program for the award year, and of any consequences of the recalculated rates under § 668.410. If the Secretary has published final D/E rates under § 668.405(g), the program's published rates will be updated to reflect the new final D/E rates.</P>

              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Loan defaults.</E> A borrower who defaulted on a FFEL or Direct Loan is not included in the numerator of the loan repayment rate formula even if that loan has been paid in full or meets the definition of being in active repayment.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Repayment rates for borrowers who completed or withdrew.</E> The Secretary may modify the formula in this paragraph to calculate repayment rates for only those borrowers who completed the program or for only those borrowers who withdrew from the program.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Transitional certification for existing programs.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an institution must provide to the Secretary no later than December 31 of the year in which this regulation takes effect, in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary, a certification signed by its most senior executive officer that each of its currently <PRTPAGE P="582"/>eligible GE programs included on its Eligibility and Certification Approval Report meets the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. The Secretary accepts the certification as an addendum to the institution's program participation agreement with the Secretary under § 668.14.</P>
              <CITA>[, as amended at 79 FR 71958, Dec. 4, 2014]</CITA>
              <P>(2) If an institution makes the certification in its program participation agreement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section between July 1 and December 31 of the year in which this regulation takes effect, it is not required to provide the transitional certification under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Program participation agreement certification.</E> As a condition of its continued participation in the title IV, HEA programs, an institution must certify in its program participation agreement with the Secretary under § 668.14 that each of its currently eligible GE programs included on its Eligibility and Certification Approval Report meets the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. An institution must update the certification within 10 days if there are any changes in the approvals for a program, or other changes for a program that make an existing certification no longer accurate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Establishing eligibility and disbursing funds.</E> (1) An institution establishes the eligibility for title IV, HEA program funds of a GE program by updating the list of the institution's eligible programs maintained by the Department to include that program, as provided under 34 CFR 600.21(a)(11)(i). By updating the list of the institution's eligible programs, the institution affirms that the program satisfies the certification requirements in paragraph (d) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, after the institution updates its list of eligible programs, the institution may disburse title IV, HEA program funds to students enrolled in that program.</P>
              <P>(2) An institution may not update its list of eligible programs to include a GE program, or a GE program that is substantially similar to a failing or zone program that the institution voluntarily discontinued or became ineligible as described in § 668.410(b)(2), that was subject to the three-year loss of eligibility under § 668.410(b)(2), until that three-year period expires.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">GE program eligibility certifications.</E> An institution certifies for each eligible program included on its Eligibility and Certification Approval Report, at the time and in the form specified in this section, that—</P>
              <P>(1) Each eligible GE program it offers is approved by a recognized accrediting agency or is otherwise included in the institution's accreditation by its recognized accrediting agency, or, if the institution is a public postsecondary vocational institution, the program is approved by a recognized State agency for the approval of public postsecondary vocational education in lieu of accreditation;</P>
              <P>(2) Each eligible GE program it offers is programmatically accredited, if such accreditation is required by a Federal governmental entity or by a governmental entity in the State in which the institution is located or in which the institution is otherwise required to obtain State approval under 34 CFR 600.9;</P>
              <P>(3) For the State in which the institution is located or in which the institution is otherwise required to obtain State approval under 34 CFR 600.9, each eligible program it offers satisfies the applicable educational prerequisites for professional licensure or certification requirements in that State so that a student who completes the program and seeks employment in that State qualifies to take any licensure or certification exam that is needed for the student to practice or find employment in an occupation that the program prepares students to enter; and</P>

              <P>(4) For a program for which the institution seeks to establish eligibility for title IV, HEA program funds, the program is not substantially similar to a program offered by the institution that, in the prior three years, became ineligible for title IV, HEA program funds under the D/E rates measure or was failing, or in the zone with respect to, the D/E rates measure and was voluntarily discontinued by the institution. The institution must include with its certification an explanation of how the new program is not substantially <PRTPAGE P="583"/>similar to any such ineligible or discontinued program.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Calculating program cohort default rates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section describes the four steps that we follow to calculate your program cohort default rate for a fiscal year:</P>
              <P>(1) First, under paragraph (b) of this section, we identify the borrowers in your GE program's cohort for the fiscal year. If the total number of borrowers in that cohort is fewer than 10, we also include the borrowers in your cohorts for the two most recent prior fiscal years for which we have data that identifies those borrowers who entered repayment during those fiscal years.</P>
              <P>(2) Second, under paragraph (c) of this section, we identify the borrowers in the cohort (or cohorts) who are considered to be in default by the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year those borrowers entered repayment. If more than one cohort will be used to calculate your program cohort default rate, we identify defaulted borrowers separately for each cohort.</P>
              <P>(3) Third, under paragraph (d) of this section, we calculate your program cohort default rate.</P>
              <P>(4) Fourth, we apply your program cohort default rate to your program at all of your locations—</P>
              <P>(i) As you exist on the date you receive the notice of your official program cohort default rate; and</P>
              <P>(ii) From the date on which you receive the notice of your official program cohort default rate until you receive our notice that the program cohort default rate no longer applies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Identify the borrowers in a cohort.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, your cohort for a fiscal year consists of all of your current and former students who, during that fiscal year, entered repayment on any Federal Stafford Loan, Federal SLS Loan, Direct Subsidized Loan, or Direct Unsubsidized Loan that they received to attend the GE program, or on the portion of a loan made under the Federal Consolidation Loan Program or the Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program that is used to repay those loans.</P>
              <P>(2) A borrower may be included in more than one of your cohorts and may be included in the cohorts of more than one institution in the same fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(3) A TEACH Grant that has been converted to a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan is not considered for the purpose of calculating and applying program cohort default rates.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Identify the borrowers in a cohort who are in default.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a borrower in a cohort for a fiscal year is considered to be in default if, before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year the borrower entered repayment—</P>
              <P>(i) The borrower defaults on any FFELP loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort or on any Federal Consolidation Loan Program loan that repaid a loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort (however, a borrower is not considered to be in default on a FFELP loan unless a claim for insurance has been paid on the loan by a guaranty agency or by us);</P>
              <P>(ii) The borrower fails to make an installment payment, when due, on any Direct Loan Program loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort or on any Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program loan that repaid a loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort, and the borrower's failure persists for 360 days;</P>
              <P>(iii) You or your owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other affiliated entity or individual make a payment to prevent a borrower's default on a loan that is used to include the borrower in that cohort; or</P>

              <P>(iv) The borrower fails to make an installment payment, when due, on a Federal Stafford Loan that is held by <PRTPAGE P="585"/>the Secretary or a Federal Consolidation Loan that is held by the Secretary and that was used to repay a Federal Stafford Loan, if such Federal Stafford Loan or Federal Consolidation Loan was used to include the borrower in the cohort, and the borrower's failure persists for 360 days.</P>
              <P>(2) A borrower is not considered to be in default based on a loan that is, before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which it entered repayment—</P>
              <P>(i) Rehabilitated under 34 CFR 682.405 or 34 CFR 685.211(e); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Repurchased by a lender because the claim for insurance was submitted or paid in error.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Calculate the program cohort default rate.</E> Except as provided in § 668.503, if there are—</P>
              <P>(1)(i) Ten or more borrowers in your cohort for a fiscal year, your program cohort default rate is the percentage that is calculated by—</P>
              <P>(ii) Dividing the number of borrowers in the cohort who are in default, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, by the number of borrowers in the cohort, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Fewer than 10 borrowers in your cohort for a fiscal year, your program cohort default rate is the percentage that is calculated by—</P>
              <P>(i) For the first two years we attempt to calculate program cohort default rates under this part for a program, dividing the total number of borrowers in that program's cohort and in the two most recent prior cohorts for which we have data to identify the individuals comprising the cohort who are in default, as determined for each program's cohort under paragraph (c) of this section, by the total number of borrowers in that program cohort and the two most recent prior cohorts for which we have data to identify the individuals comprising the cohort, as determined for each program cohort under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) For other fiscal years, by dividing the total number of borrowers in that program cohort and in the two most recent prior program cohorts who are in default, as determined for each program cohort under paragraph (c) of this section, by the total number of borrowers in that program cohort and the two most recent prior program cohorts as determined for each program cohort under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) If we identify a total of fewer than ten borrowers under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, we do not calculate a draft program cohort default rate for that fiscal year.</P>

              <P>(1) Those program cohort default rates published for a GE program offered by any of these institutions before the date of the acquisition or merger are attributed to the GE program after the merger or acquisition; and</P>

              <P>(2) Beginning with the first program cohort default rate published after the date of the acquisition or merger, the program cohort default rates for that GE program are determined by including in the calculation under § 668.502 <PRTPAGE P="586"/>the borrowers who were enrolled in that GE program from each institution that offered that program and that was involved in the acquisition or merger.</P>

              <P>(2) Beginning with the first program cohort default rate published after the date of the change, the program cohort default rates for a GE program for the next three fiscal years are determined by including the applicable borrowers who were enrolled in the GE program from your institution and from your former parent institution (including all of its locations) in the calculation under § 668.502.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Improper loan servicing.</E> For the purposes of this section, a default is considered to have been due to improper loan servicing or collection only if the borrower did not make a payment on the loan and you prove that the responsible party failed to perform one or more of the following activities, if that activity applies to the loan:</P>
              <P>(1) Send at least one letter (other than the final demand letter) urging the borrower to make payments on the loan.</P>

              <P>(2) Attempt at least one phone call to the borrower.<PRTPAGE P="590"/>

If the data manager is a guaranty agency, your request must include a copy of the loan record detail report.</P>
              <P>(3) Within 20 days after receiving your request for loan servicing records, the data manager must—</P>
              <P>(i) Send you and us a list of the borrowers in your representative sample, as described in paragraph (d) of this section (the list must be in Social Security number order, and it must include the number of defaulted loans included in the program cohort for each listed borrower);</P>
              <P>(ii) Send you and us a description of how your representative sample was chosen; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Either send you copies of the loan servicing records for the borrowers in your representative sample and send us a copy of its cover letter indicating that the records were sent, or send you and us a notice of the amount of its fee for providing copies of the loan servicing records.</P>
              <P>(4) The data manager may charge you a reasonable fee for providing copies of loan servicing records, but it may not charge more than $10 per borrower file. If a data manager charges a fee, it is not required to send the documents to you until it receives your payment of the fee.</P>
              <P>(5) If the data manager charges a fee for providing copies of loan servicing records, you must send payment in full to the data manager within 15 days after you receive the notice of the fee.</P>
              <P>(6) If the data manager charges a fee for providing copies of loan servicing records, and—</P>
              <P>(i) You pay the fee in full and on time, the data manager must send you, within 20 days after it receives your payment, a copy of all loan servicing records for each loan in your representative sample (the copies are provided to you in hard copy format unless the data manager and you agree that another format may be used), and it must send us a copy of its cover letter indicating that the records were sent; or</P>
              <P>(ii) You do not pay the fee in full and on time, the data manager must notify you and us of your failure to pay the fee and that you have waived your right to challenge the calculation of your program cohort default rate based on the data manager's records. We accept that determination unless you prove that it is incorrect.</P>
              <P>(7) Within 15 days after receiving a guaranty agency's notice that we hold an FFELP loan about which you are inquiring, you must send us your request for the loan servicing records for that loan. We respond to your request under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) Within 15 days after receiving incomplete or illegible records, you must send a request for replacement records to the data manager and us.</P>

              <P>(ii) Notify you and us that no additional or improved copies are available.</P>
              <P>(10) You must send your appeal to us, including all supporting documentation—</P>

              <P>(ii) If you are also requesting a new data adjustment or filing an erroneous data appeal, by the latest of the filing dates required in paragraph (c)(10)(i) of <PRTPAGE P="591"/>this section or in § 668.510(b)(6)(i) or § 668.511(b)(6)(i).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Representative sample of records.</E> (1) To select a representative sample of records, the data manager first identifies all of the borrowers for whom it is responsible and who had loans that were considered to be in default in the calculation of the program cohort default rate you are appealing.</P>
              <P>(2) From the group of borrowers identified under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the data manager identifies a sample that is large enough to derive an estimate, acceptable at a 95 percent confidence level with a plus or minus 5 percent confidence interval, for use in determining the number of borrowers who should be excluded from the calculation of the program cohort default rate due to improper loan servicing or collection.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Loan servicing records.</E> Loan servicing records are the collection and payment history records—</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Determination.</E> (1) We determine the number of loans, based on the loans included in your representative sample of loan servicing records, that defaulted due to improper loan servicing or collection, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Based on our determination, we use a statistically valid methodology to exclude the corresponding percentage of borrowers from both the numerator and denominator of the calculation of the program cohort default rate for the GE program, and correct the rate that is publicly released.</P>

              <P>(iii) The Secretary considers enforcement of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section to be contrary to the interest of the program only if the institution returns more than 10 percent of its allocation due to circumstances beyond the institution's control that are not expected to recur.</P>

              <P>(ii) Makes available to its students; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Otherwise knows about.</P>
              <P>(2) If a student receives amounts of estimated financial assistance at any time during the award period that were not considered in calculating the Federal Perkins Loan amount or the FWS or FSEOG award, and the total amount of estimated financial assistance including the loan, the FSEOG, or the prospective FWS wages exceeds the student's need, the overaward is the amount that exceeds need.</P>

However, if the sum of the amounts received that are being used to replace the student's EFC actually exceed the EFC, the excess amount must be treated as estimated financial assistance;</P>
              <P>(iv) Assistance not received under a title IV, HEA program, if that assistance is designated to offset all or a portion of a specific component of the cost of attendance and that amount is excluded from the cost of attendance as well.

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Treatment of estimated financial assistance in excess of need—General.</E> An institution shall take the following steps if it learns that a student has received additional amounts of estimated financial assistance not included in the calculation of Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, or FSEOG eligibility that would result in the student's total amount of estimated financial assistance exceeding his or her financial need by more than $300:</P>
              <P>(1) The institution shall decide whether the student has increased financial need that was unanticipated when it awarded financial aid to the student. If the student demonstrates increased financial need and the total amount of estimated financial assistance does not exceed this increased need by more than $300, no further action is necessary.</P>
              <P>(2) If the student's total amount of estimated financial assistance still exceeds his or her need by more than $300, as recalculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the institution shall cancel any undisbursed loan or grant (other than a Federal Pell Grant).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Federal Perkins loan and FSEOG overpayment.</E> If the student's total amount of estimated financial assistance still exceeds his or her need by more than $300, after the institution takes the steps required in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the institution shall consider the amount by which the estimated financial assistance amount exceeds the student's financial need by more than $300 as an overpayment.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Termination of FWS employment.</E> (1) An institution may fund a student's FWS employment with FWS funds only until the amount of the FWS award has been earned or until the student's financial need, as recalculated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, is met.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an institution may provide additional FWS funding to a student whose need has been met until that student's cumulative earnings from all need-based employment occurring subsequent to the time his or her financial need has been met exceed $300.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Liability for and recovery of Federal Perkins loans and FSEOG overpayments.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, a student is liable for any Federal Perkins loan or FSEOG overpayment made to him or her. An FSEOG overpayment for purposes of this paragraph does not include the non-Federal share of an FSEOG award if an institution meets its FSEOG matching share by the individual recipient method or the aggregate method.</P>
              <P>(2) The institution is liable for a Federal Perkins loan or FSEOG overpayment if the overpayment occurred because the institution failed to follow the procedures in this part or 34 CFR parts 668, 674, or 676. The institution shall restore an amount equal to the overpayment and any administrative cost allowance claimed on that amount to its loan fund for a Federal Perkins loan overpayment or to its FSEOG account for an FSEOG overpayment.</P>
              <P>(3) A student is not liable for, and the institution is not required to attempt recovery of, a Federal Perkins loan or FSEOG overpayment, nor is the institution required to refer an FSEOG overpayment to the Secretary, if the overpayment—</P>
              <P>(i) Is less than $25; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Is neither a remaining balance nor a result of the application of the overaward threshold in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, if an institution makes a Federal Perkins loan or FSEOG overpayment for which it is not liable, it shall promptly send a written notice to the student requesting repayment of the overpayment amount. The notice must state that failure to make that repayment, or to make arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to pay the overpayment, makes the student ineligible for further title IV, HEA program funds until final resolution of the overpayment.</P>

              <P>(ii) If a student objects to the institution's Federal Perkins loan or FSEOG overpayment determination on the grounds that it is erroneous, the institution shall consider any information <PRTPAGE P="598"/>provided by the student and determine whether the objection is warranted.</P>
              <P>(5) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, if a student fails to repay an FSEOG overpayment or make arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to repay the FSEOG overpayment after the institution has taken the action required by paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the institution must refer the FSEOG overpayment to the Secretary for collection purposes in accordance with procedures required by the Secretary. After referring the FSEOG overpayment to the Secretary under this section, the institution need make no further effort to recover the overpayment.</P>

              <P>(1) From estimated financial assistance other than the BIA education grant the student has received or is expected to receive; and</P>
              <P>(2) That is consistent in type and amount with packages prepared for students in similar circumstances who are not eligible for a BIA education grant.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The BIA education grant, whether received by the student before or after the preparation of the student aid package, supplements the student aid package specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) No adjustment may be made to the student aid package as long as the total of the package and the BIA education grant is less than the institution's determination of that student's financial need.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) If the BIA education grant, when combined with other aid in the package, exceeds the student's need, the excess must be deducted from the other assistance (except for Federal Pell Grants), not from the BIA education grant.</P>
              <P>(2) The institution shall deduct the excess in the following sequence: loans, work-study awards, and grants other than Federal Pell Grants. However, the institution may change the sequence if requested to do so by a student and the institution believes the change benefits the student.</P>
              <P>(d) To determine the financial need of a student who is also eligible for a BIA education grant, a financial aid administrator is encouraged to consult with area officials in charge of BIA postsecondary financial aid.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Administrative cost allowance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An institution participating in the Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, or FSEOG programs is entitled to an administrative cost allowance for an award year if it advances funds under the Federal Perkins Loan Program, provides FWS employment, or awards grants under the FSEOG Program to students in that year.</P>
              <P>(b) An institution may charge the administrative cost allowance calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for an award year against-(1) The Federal Perkins Loan Fund, if the institution advances funds under the Federal Perkins Loan Program to students in that award year;</P>

              <P>(3) The FSEOG allocation, if the institution awards grants to students under the FSEOG program in that award year.</P>
              <P>(c) For any award year, the amount of the administrative costs allowance equals—</P>

              <P>(1) Five percent of the first $2,750,000 of the institution's total expenditures to students in that award year under <PRTPAGE P="599"/>the FWS, FSEOG, and the Federal Perkins Loan programs; plus</P>
              <P>(2) Four percent of its expenditures to students that are greater than $2,750,000 but less than $5,500,000; plus</P>
              <P>(3) Three percent of its expenditures to students that are $5,500,000 or more.</P>
              <P>(d) The institution shall not include, when calculating the allowance in paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of loans made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program that it assigns during the award year to the Secretary under section 463(a)(6) of the HEA.</P>
              <P>(e) An institution shall use its administrative costs allowance to offset its cost of administering the Federal Pell Grant, FWS, FSEOG, and Federal Perkins Loan programs. Administrative costs also include the expenses incurred for carrying out the student consumer information services requirements of subpart D of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, 34 CFR part 668.</P>
              <P>(f) An institution may use up to 10 percent of the administrative costs allowance, as calculated under paragraph (c) of this section, that is attributable to the institution's expenditures under the FWS program to pay the administrative costs of conducting its program of community service. These costs may include the costs of—</P>
              <P>(1) Developing mechanisms to assure the academic quality of a student's experience;</P>
              <P>(2) Assuring student access to educational resources, expertise, and supervision necessary to achieve community service objectives; and</P>
              <P>(3) Collaborating with public and private nonprofit agencies and programs assisted under the National and Community Service Act of 1990 in the planning, development, and administration of these programs.</P>
              <P>(g) If an institution charges any administrative cost allowance against its Federal Perkins Loan Fund, it must charge these costs during the same award year in which the expenditures for these costs were made.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Federal Perkins Loan program cohort default rate and penalties.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Default penalty.</E> If an institution's cohort default rate meets the following levels, a default penalty is imposed on the institution as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">FCC reduction.</E> If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 25 percent, the institution's FCC is reduced to zero.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Ineligibility.</E> For award year 2000-2001 and succeeding award years, an institution with a cohort default rate that equals or exceeds 50 percent for each of the three most recent years for which cohort default rate data are available is ineligible to participate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program. Following a review of that data and upon notification by the Secretary, an institution is ineligible to participate for the award year, or the remainder of the award year, in which the determination is made and the two succeeding award years. An institution may appeal a notification of ineligibility from the Secretary within 30 days of its receipt.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Appeal procedures</E>—(A) <E T="03">Inaccurate calculation.</E> An institution may appeal a notice of ineligibility based upon the submission of erroneous data by the institution, the correction of which would result in a recalculation that reduces the institution's cohort default rate to below 50 percent for any of the three award years used to make a determination of ineligibility. The Secretary considers the edit process, by which an institution adjusts the cohort default rate data that it submits to the Secretary on its Fiscal Operations Report, to constitute the procedure to appeal a determination of ineligibility based on a claim of erroneous data.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Small number of borrowers entering repayment.</E> An institution may appeal a notice of ineligibility if, on average, 10 or fewer borrowers enter repayment for the three most recent award years used by the Secretary to make a determination of ineligibility.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Decision of the Secretary.</E> The Secretary issues a decision on an appeal within 45 days of the institution's submission of a complete, accurate, and timely appeal. An institution may continue to participate in the program until the Secretary issues a decision on the institution's appeal.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Liquidation of an institution's Perkins Loan portfolio.</E> Within 90 days of receiving a notification of ineligibility or, if the institution appeals, within 90 days of the Secretary's decision to deny the appeal, the institution must—</P>
              <P>(A) Liquidate its revolving student loan fund by making a capital distribution of the liquid assets of the Fund according to section 466(c) of the HEA; and</P>
              <P>(B) Assign any outstanding loans in the institution's portfolio to the Secretary in accordance with § 674.50.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> The provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section are effective with the cohort default rate calculated as of June 30, 2001.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Cohort default rate.</E> (1) The term “cohort default rate” means, for any award year in which 30 or more current and former students at the institution enter repayment on a loan received for attendance at the institution, the percentage of those current and former students who enter repayment in that award year on the loans received for attendance at that institution who default before the end of the following award year.</P>

              <P>(2) For any award year in which less than 30 current and former students at the institution enter repayment on a loan received for attendance at the institution, the “cohort default rate” means the percentage of those current and former students who entered repayment on loans received for attendance at that institution in any of the three most recent award years and who defaulted on those loans before the end of the award year immediately following the year in which they entered repayment.<PRTPAGE P="603"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Defaulted loans to be included in the cohort default rate.</E> For purposes of calculating the cohort default rate under paragraph (b) of this section—</P>
              <P>(1) A borrower must be included only if the borrower's default has persisted for at least—</P>
              <P>(i) 240 consecutive days for loans repayable in monthly installments; or</P>
              <P>(ii) 270 consecutive days for loans repayable in quarterly installments;</P>
              <P>(2) A loan is considered to be in default if a payment is made by the institution of higher education, its owner, agency, contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with the institution, in order to avoid default by the borrower;</P>
              <P>(3)(i) In determining the number of borrowers who default before the end of the following award year, a loan is excluded if the borrower has—</P>
              <P>(A) Voluntarily made six consecutive monthly payments;</P>
              <P>(B) Voluntarily made all payments currently due;</P>
              <P>(C) Repaid the full amount due, including any interest, late fees, and collection costs that have accrued on the loan;</P>
              <P>(D) Received a deferment or forbearance based on a condition that predates the borrower reaching a 240- or 270-day past due status; or</P>
              <P>(E) Rehabilitated the loan after becoming 240- or 270-days past due.</P>
              <P>(ii) A loan is considered canceled and also excluded from an institution's cohort default rate calculation if the loan is—</P>
              <P>(A) Discharged due to death or permanent and total disability;</P>
              <P>(B) Discharged in bankruptcy;</P>
              <P>(C) Discharged due to a closed school;</P>
              <P>(D) Repaid in full in accordance with § 674.33(e) or § 674(h); or</P>
              <P>(E) Assigned to and conditionally discharged by the Secretary in accordance with § 674.61(b).</P>
              <P>(iii) For the purpose of this section, funds obtained by income tax offset, garnishment, income or asset execution, or pursuant to a judgment are not considered voluntary.</P>
              <P>(4) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one institution, the student and his or her subsequent repayment or default are attributed to the institution for attendance at which the student received the loan that entered repayment in the award year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Locations of the institution.</E> (1) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all locations of the institution as it exists on the first day of the award year for which the rate is calculated.</P>
              <P>(2) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all locations of the institution from the date the institution is notified of that rate until the institution is notified by the Secretary that the rate no longer applies.</P>
              <P>(3) For an institution that changes status from a location of one institution to a free-standing institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the institution's status as of July 1 of the award year for which a cohort default rate is being calculated.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) For an institution that changes status from a free-standing institution to a location of another institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the combined number of students who default during the applicable award years from both the former free-standing institution and the other institution. This cohort default rate applies to the new consolidated institution and all of its current locations.</P>
              <P>(ii) For free-standing institutions that merge, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the combined number of students who default during the applicable award years from both of the institutions that are merging. This cohort default rate applies to the new, consolidated institution.</P>

              <P>(iii) For an institution that changes status from a location of one institution to a location of another institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the number of students who default during the applicable award years from both of the institutions in <PRTPAGE P="604"/>their entirety, not limited solely to the respective locations.</P>
              <P>(5) For an institution that has a change in ownership that results in a change in control, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the combined number of students who default during the applicable award years from the institution under both the old and new control.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Low-income individual.</E> (i) For Federal Perkins loans and NDSLs made on or after October 1, 1980, the institution may extend the borrower's repayment period up to 10 additional years beyond the 10-year maximum repayment period if the institution determines during the course of the repayment period that the borrower is a “low-income individual.” The borrower qualifies for an extension of the repayment period on the basis of low-income status only during the period in which the borrower meets the criteria described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this section. The term <E T="03">low-income individual</E> means the following:</P>
              <P>(A) For an unmarried borrower without dependents, an individual whose total income for the preceding calendar year did not exceed 45 percent of the Income Protection Allowance for the current award year for a family of four with one in college.</P>

              <P>(ii) The institution shall use the Income Protection Allowance published annually in accordance with section 478 of the HEA in making this determination.</P>
              <P>(iii) The institution shall review the borrower's status annually to determine whether the borrower continues to qualify for an extended repayment period based on his or her status as a “low-income individual.”</P>
              <P>(iv) Upon determining that a borrower ceases to qualify for an extended repayment period under this section, the institution shall amend the borrower's repayment schedule. The term of the amended repayment schedule may not exceed the number of months remaining on the original repayment schedule, provided that the institution may not include the time elapsed during any extension of the repayment period granted under this section in determining the number of months remaining on the original repayment schedule.</P>
              <P>(3) Interest continues to accrue during any extension of a repayment period.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Forbearance.</E> (1) Forbearance means the temporary cessation of payments, allowing an extension of time for making payments, or temporarily accepting smaller payments than previously were scheduled.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon receipt of a request and supporting documentation, the institution shall grant the borrower forbearance of principal and, unless otherwise indicated by the borrower, interest renewable at intervals of up to 12 months for periods that collectively do not exceed three years.</P>
              <P>(3) The terms of forbearance must be agreed upon, in writing, by the borrower and the institution. The school confirms this agreement by notice to the borrower, and by recording the terms in the borrower's file.</P>

              <P>(4) In granting a forbearance under this section, an institution shall grant a temporary cessation of payments, unless the borrower chooses another form of forbearance subject to paragraph (d)(1) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="616"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) An institution shall grant forbearance if—</P>
              <P>(i) The amount of the payments the borrower is obligated to make on title IV loans each month (or a proportional share if the payments are due less frequently than monthly) is collectively equal to or greater than 20 percent of the borrower's total monthly gross income;</P>
              <P>(ii) The institution determines that the borrower should qualify for the forbearance due to poor health or for other acceptable reasons; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The Secretary authorizes a period of forbearance due to a national military mobilization or other national emergency.</P>
              <P>(6) Before granting a forbearance to a borrower under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, the institution shall require the borrower to submit at least the following documentation:</P>
              <P>(i) Evidence showing the amount of the most recent total monthly gross income received by the borrower; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Evidence showing the amount of the monthly payments owed by the borrower for the most recent month for the borrower's title IV loans.</P>
              <P>(7) Interest accrues during any period of forbearance.</P>
              <P>(8) The institution may not include the periods of forbearance described in this paragraph in determining the 10-year repayment period.</P>

              <P>(a) Each institution must establish a loan rehabilitation program for all borrowers for the purpose of rehabilitating defaulted loans made under this part, except for loans for which a judgment has been secured or loans obtained by fraud for which the borrower has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving fraud in obtaining title IV, HEA program assistance. The institution's loan rehabilitation program must provide that—</P>
              <P>(1) A defaulted borrower is notified of the option and consequences of rehabilitating a loan; and</P>
              <P>(2) A loan is rehabilitated if the borrower—</P>
              <P>(i) Requests rehabilitation; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Makes a full monthly payment—as determined by the institution—within 20 days of the due date, each month for 9 consecutive months.</P>
              <P>(b) Within 30 days of receiving the borrower's last on-time, consecutive, monthly payment, the institution must—</P>
              <P>(1) Return the borrower to regular repayment status;</P>
              <P>(2) Treat the first payment made under the nine consecutive payments as the first payment under the 10-year repayment maximum; and</P>
              <P>(3) Instruct any credit bureau to which the default was reported to remove the default from the borrower's credit history.</P>
              <P>(c) Collection costs on a rehabilitated loan—</P>
              <P>(1) If charged to the borrower, may not exceed 24 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest as of the date following application of the twelfth payment;</P>

              <P>(2) That exceed the amounts specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, may be charged to an institution's Fund <PRTPAGE P="629"/>until July 1, 2002 in accordance with § 674.47(e)(5); and</P>
              <P>(3) Are not restricted to 24 percent in the event the borrower defaults on the rehabilitated loan.</P>
              <P>(d) After rehabilitating a defaulted loan and returning to regular repayment status, the borrower regains the balance of the benefits and privileges of the promissory note as applied prior to the borrower's default on the loan. Nothing in this paragraph prohibits an institution from offering the borrower flexible repayment options following the borrower's return to regular repayment status on a rehabilitated loan.</P>
              <P>(e) The borrower may rehabilitate a defaulted loan only one time.</P>

              <P>(i) Litigate in accordance with the procedures in § 674.46;</P>
              <P>(ii) Make a second effort to collect the account as follows:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Bankruptcy of borrower.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> If an institution receives notice that a borrower has filed a petition for relief in bankruptcy, usually <PRTPAGE P="639"/>by receiving a notice of meeting of creditors, the institution and its agents shall immediately suspend any collection efforts outside the bankruptcy proceeding against the borrower.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Proof of claim.</E> The institution must file a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding unless—</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of a proceeding under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, the notice of meeting of creditors states that the borrower has no assets, or</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of a bankruptcy proceeding under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in which the repayment plan proposes that the borrower repay less than the full amount owed on the loan, the institution has an authoritative determination by an appropriate State official that in the opinion of the State official, the institution is an agency of the State and is, on that basis, under applicable State law, immune from suit.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Borrower's request for determination of dischargeability.</E> (1) The institution must use due diligence and may assert any defense consistent with its status under applicable law to avoid discharge of the loan. The institution must follow the procedures in this paragraph to respond to a complaint for a determination of dischargeability under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8) on the ground that repayment of the loan would impose an undue hardship on the borrower and his or her dependents, unless discharge would be more effectively opposed by avoiding that action.</P>
              <P>(2) If the petition for relief in bankruptcy was filed before October 8, 1998 and more than seven years of the repayment period on the loan (excluding any applicable suspension of the repayment period defined in 34 CFR 682.402(m)) have passed before the borrower filed the petition, the institution may not oppose a determination of dischargeability requested under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(B) on the ground of undue hardship.</P>
              <P>(3) In any other case, the institution must determine, on the basis of reasonably available information, whether repayment of the loan under either the current repayment schedule or any adjusted schedule authorized under subpart B or D of this part would impose an undue hardship on the borrower and his or her dependents.</P>
              <P>(4) If the institution concludes that repayment would not impose an undue hardship, the institution shall determine whether the costs reasonably expected to be incurred to oppose discharge will exceed one-third of the total amount owed on the loan, including principal, interest, late charges and collection costs.</P>
              <P>(5) If the expected costs of opposing discharge of such a loan do not exceed one-third of the total amount owed on the loan, the institution shall—</P>
              <P>(i) Oppose the borrower's request for a determination of dischargeability; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If the borrower is in default on the loan, seek a judgment for the amount owed on the loan.</P>
              <P>(6) In opposing a request for a determination of dischargeability, the institution may compromise a portion of the amount owed on the loan if it reasonably determines that the compromise is necessary in order to obtain a judgment on the loan.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Request for determination of non-dischargeability.</E> The institution may file a complaint for a determination that a loan obligation is not dischargeable and for judgment on the loan if the institution would have been required under paragraph (c) of this section to oppose a request for a determination of dischargeability with regard to that loan.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Chapter 13 repayment plan.</E> (1) The institution shall follow the procedures in this paragraph in response to a repayment plan proposed by a borrower who has filed for relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.</P>
              <P>(2) The institution is not required to respond to a proposed repayment plan, if—</P>
              <P>(i) The borrower proposes under the repayment plan to repay all principal, interest, late charges and collection costs on the loan; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The repayment plan makes no provision with regard either to the loan obligation or to general unsecured claims.</P>

              <P>(3)(i) If the borrower proposes under the repayment plan to repay less than the total amount owed on the loan, the <PRTPAGE P="640"/>institution shall determine from its own records and court documents—</P>
              <P>(A) The amount of the loan obligation dischargeable under the plan by deducting the total payments on the loan proposed under the plan from the total amount owed;</P>
              <P>(B) Whether the plan or the classification of the loan obligation under the proposed plan meets the requirements of section 1325 of the Code; and</P>
              <P>(C) Whether grounds exist under 11 U.S.C. 1307 to move for conversion or dismissal of the chapter 13 case.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the institution reasonably expects that costs of the appropriate actions will not exceed one-third of the dischargeable loan debt, the institution shall—</P>
              <P>(A) Object to confirmation of a proposed plan that does not meet the requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1325; and</P>
              <P>(B) Move to dismiss or convert a case where grounds can be established under 11 U.S.C. 1307.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) The institution must monitor the borrower's compliance with the requirements of the plan confirmed by the court. If the institution determines that the debtor has not made the payments required under the plan, or has filed a request for a “hardship discharge” under 11 U.S.C. 1328(b), the institution must determine from its own records and information derived from documents filed with the court—</P>
              <P>(A) Whether grounds exist under 11 U.S.C. 1307 to convert or dismiss the case; and</P>
              <P>(B) Whether the borrower has demonstrated entitlement to the “hardship discharge” by meeting the requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1328(b).</P>
              <P>(ii) If the institution reasonably expects that costs of the appropriate actions, when added to the costs already incurred in taking actions authorized under this section, will not exceed one-third of the dischargeable loan debt, the institution shall—</P>
              <P>(A) Move to dismiss or convert a case where grounds can be established under 11 U.S.C. 1307; or</P>
              <P>(B) Oppose the requested discharge where the debtor has not demonstrated that the requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1328(b) are met.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Resumption of collection from the borrower.</E> The institution shall resume billing and collection action prescribed in this subpart after—</P>
              <P>(1) The borrower's petition for relief in bankruptcy has been dismissed;</P>
              <P>(2) The borrower has received a discharge under 11 U.S.C. 727, 11 U.S.C. 1141, or 11 U.S.C. 1228, unless—</P>
              <P>(i) The court has found that repayment of the loan would impose an undue hardship on the borrower and the dependents of the borrower; or</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) The petition for relief was filed before October 8, 1998;</P>
              <P>(B) The loan entered the repayment period more than seven years (excluding any applicable suspension of the repayment period as defined by 34 CFR 682.402(m), and</P>
              <P>(C) The loan is not excepted from discharge under other applicable provisions of the Code; or</P>
              <P>(3) The borrower has received a discharge under 11 U.S.C. 1328(a) or 1328(b), unless—</P>
              <P>(i) The court has found that repayment of the loan would impose an undue hardship on the borrower and the dependents of the borrower; or</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) The petition for relief was filed before October 8, 1998;</P>
              <P>(B) The loan entered the repayment period more than seven years (excluding any application suspension of the repayment period as defined by 34 CFR 682.402(m) before the filing of the petition; and</P>
              <P>(C) The borrower's plan approved in the bankruptcy proceeding made some provision with regard to either the loan obligation or unsecured debts in general.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Termination of collection and write-off.</E> (1) An institution must terminate all collection action and write off a loan if it receives a general order of discharge—</P>
              <P>(i) In a bankruptcy in which the borrower filed for relief before October 8, 1998, if the loan entered the repayment period more than seven years (exclusive of any applicable suspension of the repayment period defined by 34 CFR 682.402(m)) from the date on which a petition for relief was filed; or</P>

              <P>(ii) In any other case, a judgment that repayment of the debt would constitute an undue hardship and that the debt is therefore dischargeable.<PRTPAGE P="641"/>
              </P>

              <P>(A) The physician certified the borrower's application; or</P>
              <P>(B) The Secretary received the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary may require the borrower to submit additional medical evidence if the Secretary determines that the borrower's application does not conclusively prove that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled as defined in § 674.51(aa)(1). As part of the Secretary's review of the borrower's discharge application, the Secretary may require and arrange for an additional review of the borrower's condition by an independent physician at no expense to the borrower.</P>
              <P>(iii) After determining that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled as defined in § 674.51(aa)(1), the Secretary notifies the borrower and the borrower's lenders that the application for a disability discharge has been approved. With this notification, the Secretary provides the date the physician certified the borrower's loan discharge application or the date the Secretary received the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits and directs each institution holding a Defense, NDSL, or Perkins Loan made to the borrower to assign the loan to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(iv) The institution must assign the loan to the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) After the loan is assigned, the Secretary discharges the borrower's obligation to make further payments on the loan and notifies the borrower and the institution that the loan has been discharged. The notification to the borrower explains the terms and conditions under which the borrower's obligation to repay the loan will be reinstated, as specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Any payments received after the date the physician certified the borrower's loan discharge application or the date the Secretary received the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits are returned to the person who made the payments on the loan in accordance with paragraph (b)(8) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) If the Secretary determines that the physician's certification or the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits provided by the borrower does not support the conclusion that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled as defined in § 674.51(aa)(1), the Secretary notifies the borrower and the institution that the application for a disability discharge has been denied. The notification includes—</P>
              <P>(A) The reason or reasons for the denial;</P>

              <P>(E) An explanation that if the borrower does not request re-evaluation of the borrower's prior discharge application within 12 months of the date of the notification, the borrower must submit a new total and permanent disability discharge application to the Secretary if the borrower wishes the Secretary to re-evaluate the borrower's eligibility for a total and permanent disability discharge.</P>
              <P>(vii) If the borrower requests re-evaluation in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(D) of this section or submits a new total and permanent disability discharge application in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(E) of this section, the request must include new information regarding the borrower's disabling condition that was not provided to the Secretary in connection with the prior application at the time the Secretary reviewed the borrower's initial application for a total and permanent disability discharge.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Treatment of disbursements made during the period from the date of the physician's certification or the date the Secretary received the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits until the date of discharge.</E> If a borrower received a title IV loan or TEACH Grant before the date the physician certified the borrower's discharge application or before the date the Secretary received the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits and a disbursement of that loan or grant is made during the period from the date of the physician's certification or the date the Secretary received the SSA notice of award for SSDI or SSI benefits until the date the Secretary grants a discharge under this section, the processing of the borrower's loan discharge application will be suspended until the borrower ensures that the full amount of the disbursement has been returned to the loan holder or to the Secretary, as applicable.</P>

For example, if three borrowers, all on different repayment schedules, owed and missed their first installment payment on January 2 and all three made their next payment on April 10, the maximum penalty charges that could be assessed each individual borrower would be as follows: $16 to the monthly repayment schedule borrower; $9 to the bimonthly repayment schedule borrower; and $18 to the quarterly repayment schedule borrower.</TNOTE>

              <P>(B) Other institutionally related charges incurred by the student at the institution.</P>
              <P>(2) If the institution is using FWS funds in combination with other Title IV, HEA program funds to credit a student's account at the institution to satisfy prior award year charges, a single $200 total prior award year charge limit applies to the use of all the Title IV, HEA program funds for that purpose.</P>
