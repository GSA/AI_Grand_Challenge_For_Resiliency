      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2018), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Child with a disability.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General—</E>(1) <E T="03">Child with a disability</E> means a child evaluated in accordance with §§ 300.304 through 300.311 as having an intellectual disability, a hearing impairment (including deafness), a speech or language impairment, a visual impairment (including blindness), a serious emotional disturbance (referred to in this part as “emotional disturbance”), an orthopedic impairment, autism, traumatic brain injury, an other health impairment, a specific learning disability, deaf-blindness, or multiple disabilities, and who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services.</P>
                <P>(2)(i) Subject to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, if it is determined, through an appropriate evaluation under §§ 300.304 through 300.311, that a child has one of the disabilities identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but only needs a related service and not special education, the child is not a child with a disability under this part.</P>
                <P>(ii) If, consistent with § 300.39(a)(2), the related service required by the child is considered special education rather than a related service under State standards, the child would be determined to be a child with a disability under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Children aged three through nine experiencing developmental delays. Child with a disability</E> for children aged three through nine (or any subset of that age range, including ages three through five), may, subject to the conditions described in § 300.111(b), include a child—</P>
                <P>(1) Who is experiencing developmental delays, as defined by the State and as measured by appropriate diagnostic instruments and procedures, in one or more of the following areas: Physical development, cognitive development, communication development, social or emotional development, or adaptive development; and</P>
                <P>(2) Who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions of disability terms.</E> The terms used in this definition of a child with a disability are defined as follows:</P>
                <P>(1)(i) <E T="03">Autism</E> means a developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and nonverbal communication and social interaction, generally evident before age three, that adversely affects a child's educational performance. Other characteristics often associated with autism are engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences.</P>
                <P>(ii) Autism does not apply if a child's educational performance is adversely affected primarily because the child has an emotional disturbance, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) A child who manifests the characteristics of autism after age three could be identified as having autism if the criteria in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section are satisfied.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Deaf-blindness</E> means concomitant hearing and visual impairments, the combination of which causes such severe communication and other developmental and educational needs that they cannot be accommodated in special education programs solely for children with deafness or children with blindness.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Deafness</E> means a hearing impairment that is so severe that the child is impaired in processing linguistic information through hearing, with or without amplification, that adversely affects a child's educational performance.</P>
                <P>(4)(i) <E T="03">Emotional disturbance</E> means a condition exhibiting one or more of the following characteristics over a long period of time and to a marked degree that adversely affects a child's educational performance:</P>

                <P>(A) An inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors.<PRTPAGE P="13"/>
                </P>
                <P>(B) An inability to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers.</P>
                <P>(C) Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal circumstances.</P>
                <P>(D) A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.</P>
                <P>(E) A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with personal or school problems.</P>
                <P>(ii) Emotional disturbance includes schizophrenia. The term does not apply to children who are socially maladjusted, unless it is determined that they have an emotional disturbance under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Hearing impairment</E> means an impairment in hearing, whether permanent or fluctuating, that adversely affects a child's educational performance but that is not included under the definition of deafness in this section.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Intellectual disability</E> means significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during the developmental period, that adversely affects a child's educational performance. The term “intellectual disability” was formerly termed “mental retardation.”</P>

However, the public agency must include that child in the population whose needs are addressed consistent with §§ 300.131 through 300.144.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Disagreements about FAPE.</E> Disagreements between the parents and a public agency regarding the availability of a program appropriate for the child, and the question of financial reimbursement, are subject to the due process procedures in §§ 300.504 through 300.520.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Reimbursement for private school placement.</E> If the parents of a child with a disability, who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency, enroll the child in a private preschool, elementary school, or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public agency, a court or a hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made FAPE available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment and that the private placement is appropriate. A parental placement may be found to be appropriate by a hearing officer or a court even if it does not meet the State standards that apply to education provided by the SEA and LEAs.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitation on reimbursement.</E> The cost of reimbursement described in paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced or denied—</P>

                <P>(ii) At least ten (10) business days (including any holidays that occur on a business day) prior to the removal of the child from the public school, the parents did not give written notice to the public agency of the information described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section;</P>
                <P>(2) If, prior to the parents' removal of the child from the public school, the public agency informed the parents, through the notice requirements described in § 300.503(a)(1), of its intent to evaluate the child (including a statement of the purpose of the evaluation that was appropriate and reasonable), but the parents did not make the child available for the evaluation; or</P>

                <P>(i) The school prevented the parents from providing the notice;</P>

                <P>(iii) Compliance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section would likely result in physical harm to the child; and</P>

                <P>(i) The parents are not literate or cannot write in English; or</P>

                <P>(b) If a State provides clear and convincing evidence that all eligible children with disabilities throughout the State have FAPE available to them, the Secretary may waive for a period of one year in whole or in part the requirement under § 300.162 (regarding State-level nonsupplanting) if the Secretary concurs with the evidence provided by the State.</P>
                <P>(c) If a State wishes to request a waiver under this section, it must submit to the Secretary a written request that includes—</P>
                <P>(1) An assurance that FAPE is currently available, and will remain available throughout the period that a waiver would be in effect, to all eligible children with disabilities throughout the State, regardless of the public agency that is responsible for providing FAPE to them. The assurance must be signed by an official who has the authority to provide that assurance as it applies to all eligible children with disabilities in the State;</P>
                <P>(2) All evidence that the State wishes the Secretary to consider in determining whether all eligible children with disabilities have FAPE available to them, setting forth in detail—</P>
                <P>(i) The basis on which the State has concluded that FAPE is available to all eligible children in the State; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The procedures that the State will implement to ensure that FAPE remains available to all eligible children in the State, which must include—</P>
                <P>(A) The State's procedures under § 300.111 for ensuring that all eligible children are identified, located and evaluated;</P>
                <P>(B) The State's procedures for monitoring public agencies to ensure that they comply with all requirements of this part;</P>
                <P>(C) The State's complaint procedures under §§ 300.151 through 300.153; and</P>

                <P>(3) A summary of all State and Federal monitoring reports, and State complaint decisions (see §§ 300.151 through 300.153) and hearing decisions (see §§ 300.511 through 300.516 and §§ 300.530 through 300.536), issued within three years prior to the date of the <PRTPAGE P="45"/>State's request for a waiver under this section, that includes any finding that FAPE has not been available to one or more eligible children, and evidence that FAPE is now available to all children addressed in those reports or decisions; and</P>
                <P>(4) Evidence that the State, in determining that FAPE is currently available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State, has consulted with the State advisory panel under § 300.167.</P>
                <P>(d) If the Secretary determines that the request and supporting evidence submitted by the State makes a prima facie showing that FAPE is, and will remain, available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State, the Secretary, after notice to the public throughout the State, conducts a public hearing at which all interested persons and organizations may present evidence regarding the following issues:</P>
                <P>(1) Whether FAPE is currently available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State.</P>
                <P>(2) Whether the State will be able to ensure that FAPE remains available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State if the Secretary provides the requested waiver.</P>
                <P>(e) Following the hearing, the Secretary, based on all submitted evidence, will provide a waiver, in whole or in part, for a period of one year if the Secretary finds that the State has provided clear and convincing evidence that FAPE is currently available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State, and the State will be able to ensure that FAPE remains available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State if the Secretary provides the requested waiver.</P>
                <P>(f) A State may receive a waiver of the requirement of section 612(a)(18)(A) of the Act and § 300.164 if it satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(g) The Secretary may grant subsequent waivers for a period of one year each, if the Secretary determines that the State has provided clear and convincing evidence that all eligible children with disabilities throughout the State have, and will continue to have throughout the one-year period of the waiver, FAPE available to them.</P>

                <P>(2) The number of private school children with disabilities (as defined in §§ 300.8(a) and 300.130) in the State, LEA or other public agency, as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data available, which may include an estimate of the number of those children with disabilities.</P>
                <P>(d) The Secretary deducts from the State's allocation under Part B of the Act the amount the Secretary determines is necessary to implement a by-pass and pays that amount to the provider of services. The Secretary may withhold this amount from the State's allocation pending final resolution of any investigation or complaint that could result in a determination that a by-pass must be implemented.</P>

              <P>(i) Local funds only;</P>
              <P>(ii) The combination of State and local funds;</P>

              <P>(2) When determining the amount of funds that the LEA must budget to meet the requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the LEA may take into consideration, to the extent the information is available, the exceptions and adjustment provided in §§ 300.204 and 300.205 that the LEA:</P>
              <P>(i) Took in the intervening year or years between the most recent fiscal year for which information is available and the fiscal year for which the LEA is budgeting; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Reasonably expects to take in the fiscal year for which the LEA is budgeting.</P>
              <P>(3) Expenditures made from funds provided by the Federal government for which the SEA is required to account to the Federal government or for which the LEA is required to account to the Federal government directly or through the SEA may not be considered in determining whether an LEA meets the standard in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance standard.</E> (1) Except as provided in §§ 300.204 and 300.205, funds provided to an LEA under Part B of the Act must not be used to reduce the level of expenditures for the education of children with disabilities made by the LEA from local funds below the level of those expenditures for the preceding fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(2) An LEA meets this standard if it does not reduce the level of expenditures for the education of children with disabilities made by the LEA from at least one of the following sources below the level of those expenditures from the same source for the preceding fiscal year, except as provided in §§ 300.204 and 300.205:</P>

              <P>(2) If, in any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2015, an LEA fails to meet the requirement of paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (iii) of this section and the LEA is relying on local funds only, or local funds only on a per capita basis, to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the level of expenditures required of the LEA for the fiscal year subsequent to the year of the failure is the amount that would have been required under paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (iii) in the absence of that failure, not the LEA's reduced level of expenditures.</P>

              <P>(3) If, in any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2015, an LEA fails to meet the requirement of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (iv) of this section and the LEA is relying on the combination of State and local funds, or the combination of State and local funds on a per capita basis, to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the level of expenditures required of the LEA for the fiscal year subsequent to the year of the failure is the amount <PRTPAGE P="57"/>that would have been required under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (iv) in the absence of that failure, not the LEA's reduced level of expenditures.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Adjustment to State fiscal effort in certain fiscal years.</E> For any fiscal year for which the allotment received by a State under § 300.703 exceeds the amount the State received for the previous fiscal year and if the State in school year 2003-2004 or any subsequent school year pays or reimburses all LEAs within the State from State revenue 100 percent of the non-Federal share of the costs of special education and related services, the SEA, notwithstanding §§ 300.162 through 300.163 (related to State-level nonsupplanting and maintenance of effort), and § 300.175 (related to direct services by the SEA) may reduce the level of expenditures from State sources for the education of children with disabilities by not more than 50 percent of the amount of such excess.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Prohibition.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if the Secretary determines that an SEA is unable to establish, maintain, or oversee programs of FAPE that meet the requirements of this part, or that the State needs assistance, intervention, or substantial intervention under § 300.603, the Secretary prohibits the SEA from exercising the authority in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Parental consent for initial evaluation.</E> (1)(i) The public agency proposing to conduct an initial evaluation to determine if a child qualifies as a child with a disability under § 300.8 must, after providing notice consistent with §§ 300.503 and 300.504, obtain informed consent, consistent with § 300.9, from the parent of the child before conducting the evaluation.</P>
                <P>(ii) Parental consent for initial evaluation must not be construed as consent for initial provision of special education and related services.</P>
                <P>(iii) The public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain the informed consent from the parent for an initial evaluation to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.</P>

                <P>(2) For initial evaluations only, if the child is a ward of the State and is not residing with the child's parent, the public agency is not required to obtain informed consent from the parent for an initial evaluation to determine <PRTPAGE P="64"/>whether the child is a child with a disability if—</P>
                <P>(i) Despite reasonable efforts to do so, the public agency cannot discover the whereabouts of the parent of the child;</P>
                <P>(ii) The rights of the parents of the child have been terminated in accordance with State law; or</P>
                <P>(iii) The rights of the parent to make educational decisions have been subrogated by a judge in accordance with State law and consent for an initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent the child.</P>
                <P>(3)(i) If the parent of a child enrolled in public school or seeking to be enrolled in public school does not provide consent for initial evaluation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or the parent fails to respond to a request to provide consent, the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the initial evaluation of the child by utilizing the procedural safeguards in subpart E of this part (including the mediation procedures under § 300.506 or the due process procedures under §§ 300.507 through 300.516), if appropriate, except to the extent inconsistent with State law relating to such parental consent.</P>
                <P>(ii) The public agency does not violate its obligation under § 300.111 and §§ 300.301 through 300.311 if it declines to pursue the evaluation.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Parental consent for services.</E> (1) A public agency that is responsible for making FAPE available to a child with a disability must obtain informed consent from the parent of the child before the initial provision of special education and related services to the child.</P>
                <P>(2) The public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for the initial provision of special education and related services to the child.</P>
                <P>(3) If the parent of a child fails to respond to a request for, or refuses to consent to, the initial provision of special education and related services, the public agency—</P>
                <P>(i) May not use the procedures in subpart E of this part (including the mediation procedures under § 300.506 or the due process procedures under §§ 300.507 through 300.516) in order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services may be provided to the child;</P>
                <P>(ii) Will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available to the child because of the failure to provide the child with the special education and related services for which the parent refuses to or fails to provide consent; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting or develop an IEP under §§ 300.320 and 300.324 for the child.</P>
                <P>(4) If, at any time subsequent to the initial provision of special education and related services, the parent of a child revokes consent in writing for the continued provision of special education and related services, the public agency—</P>
                <P>(i) May not continue to provide special education and related services to the child, but must provide prior written notice in accordance with § 300.503 before ceasing the provision of special education and related services;</P>
                <P>(ii) May not use the procedures in subpart E of this part (including the mediation procedures under § 300.506 or the due process procedures under §§ 300.507 through 300.516) in order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services may be provided to the child;</P>
                <P>(iii) Will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available to the child because of the failure to provide the child with further special education and related services; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting or develop an IEP under §§ 300.320 and 300.324 for the child for further provision of special education and related services.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Parental consent for reevaluations.</E> (1) Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each public agency—</P>
                <P>(i) Must obtain informed parental consent, in accordance with § 300.300(a)(1), prior to conducting any reevaluation of a child with a disability.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the parent refuses to consent to the reevaluation, the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the reevaluation by using the consent override procedures described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>

                <P>(iii) The public agency does not violate its obligation under § 300.111 and <PRTPAGE P="65"/>§§ 300.301 through 300.311 if it declines to pursue the evaluation or reevaluation.</P>
                <P>(2) The informed parental consent described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section need not be obtained if the public agency can demonstrate that—</P>
                <P>(i) It made reasonable efforts to obtain such consent; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The child's parent has failed to respond.</P>
                <P>(d) Other consent requirements.</P>
                <P>(1) Parental consent is not required before—</P>
                <P>(i) Reviewing existing data as part of an evaluation or a reevaluation; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Administering a test or other evaluation that is administered to all children unless, before administration of that test or evaluation, consent is required of parents of all children.</P>
                <P>(2) In addition to the parental consent requirements described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, a State may require parental consent for other services and activities under this part if it ensures that each public agency in the State establishes and implements effective procedures to ensure that a parent's refusal to consent does not result in a failure to provide the child with FAPE.</P>
                <P>(3) A public agency may not use a parent's refusal to consent to one service or activity under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), or (d)(2) of this section to deny the parent or child any other service, benefit, or activity of the public agency, except as required by this part.</P>
                <P>(4)(i) If a parent of a child who is home schooled or placed in a private school by the parents at their own expense does not provide consent for the initial evaluation or the reevaluation, or the parent fails to respond to a request to provide consent, the public agency may not use the consent override procedures (described in paragraphs (a)(3) and (c)(1) of this section); and</P>
                <P>(ii) The public agency is not required to consider the child as eligible for services under §§ 300.132 through 300.144.</P>
                <P>(5) To meet the reasonable efforts requirement in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii), (a)(2)(i), (b)(2), and (c)(2)(i) of this section, the public agency must document its attempts to obtain parental consent using the procedures in § 300.322(d).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Independent educational evaluation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The parents of a child with a disability have the right under this part to obtain an independent educational evaluation of the child, subject to paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Each public agency must provide to parents, upon request for an independent educational evaluation, information about where an independent educational evaluation may be obtained, and the agency criteria applicable for independent educational evaluations as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) For the purposes of this subpart—</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Independent educational evaluation</E> means an evaluation conducted by a qualified examiner who is not employed by the public agency responsible for the education of the child in question; and</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Public expense</E> means that the public agency either pays for the full cost of the evaluation or ensures that the evaluation is otherwise provided at no cost to the parent, consistent with § 300.103.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Parent right to evaluation at public expense.</E> (1) A parent has the right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if the parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the public agency, subject to the conditions in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If a parent requests an independent educational evaluation at public expense, the public agency must, without unnecessary delay, either—</P>
              <P>(i) File a due process complaint to request a hearing to show that its evaluation is appropriate; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Ensure that an independent educational evaluation is provided at public expense, unless the agency demonstrates in a hearing pursuant to §§ 300.507 through 300.513 that the evaluation obtained by the parent did not meet agency criteria.</P>
              <P>(3) If the public agency files a due process complaint notice to request a hearing and the final decision is that the agency's evaluation is appropriate, the parent still has the right to an independent educational evaluation, but not at public expense.</P>
              <P>(4) If a parent requests an independent educational evaluation, the public agency may ask for the parent's reason why he or she objects to the public evaluation. However, the public agency may not require the parent to provide an explanation and may not unreasonably delay either providing the independent educational evaluation at public expense or filing a due process complaint to request a due process hearing to defend the public evaluation.</P>
              <P>(5) A parent is entitled to only one independent educational evaluation at public expense each time the public agency conducts an evaluation with which the parent disagrees.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Parent-initiated evaluations.</E> If the parent obtains an independent educational evaluation at public expense or shares with the public agency an evaluation obtained at private expense, the results of the evaluation—</P>
              <P>(1) Must be considered by the public agency, if it meets agency criteria, in any decision made with respect to the provision of FAPE to the child; and</P>
              <P>(2) May be presented by any party as evidence at a hearing on a due process complaint under subpart E of this part regarding that child.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Requests for evaluations by hearing officers.</E> If a hearing officer requests an independent educational evaluation as part of a hearing on a due process complaint, the cost of the evaluation must be at public expense.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Agency criteria.</E> (1) If an independent educational evaluation is at public expense, the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained, including the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the examiner, must be the same as the criteria that the public agency uses when it initiates an evaluation, to the extent those criteria are consistent with the parent's right to an independent educational evaluation.</P>
              <P>(2) Except for the criteria described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a public agency may not impose conditions or timelines related to obtaining an independent educational evaluation at public expense.</P>

              <P>(ii) May not include an attorney of the LEA unless the parent is accompanied by an attorney.</P>
              <P>(2) The purpose of the meeting is for the parent of the child to discuss the due process complaint, and the facts that form the basis of the due process complaint, so that the LEA has the opportunity to resolve the dispute that is the basis for the due process complaint.</P>

              <P>(3) Except where the parties have jointly agreed to waive the resolution process or to use mediation, notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the failure of the parent filing a due process complaint to participate in the resolution meeting will delay the timelines for the resolution process and due process hearing until the meeting is held.</P>
              <P>(4) If the LEA is unable to obtain the participation of the parent in the resolution meeting after reasonable efforts have been made (and documented using the procedures in § 300.322(d)), the LEA may, at the conclusion of the 30-day period, request that a hearing officer dismiss the parent's due process complaint.</P>
              <P>(5) If the LEA fails to hold the resolution meeting specified in paragraph (a) of this section within 15 days of receiving notice of a parent's due process complaint or fails to participate in the resolution meeting, the parent may seek the intervention of a hearing officer to begin the due process hearing timeline.</P>

              <P>(3) If both parties agree in writing to continue the mediation at the end of the 30-day resolution period, but later, the parent or public agency withdraws from the mediation process.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Written settlement agreement.</E> If a resolution to the dispute is reached at the meeting described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the parties must execute a legally binding agreement that is—</P>
              <P>(1) Signed by both the parent and a representative of the agency who has the authority to bind the agency; and</P>
              <P>(2) Enforceable in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States, or, by the SEA, if the State has other mechanisms or procedures that permit parties to seek enforcement of resolution agreements, pursuant to § 300.537.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Allocations to LEAs.</E> For each fiscal year for which funds are allocated to States under § 300.703, each State shall allocate funds as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Base payments.</E> The State first must award each LEA described in paragraph (a) of this section the amount the LEA would have received under section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999, if the State had distributed 75 percent of its grant for that year under section 611(d) of the Act, as that section was then in effect.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Base payment adjustments.</E> For any fiscal year after 1999—</P>
                <P>(i) If a new LEA is created, the State must divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the LEAs that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities now being served by the new LEA, among the new LEA and affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, or ages 6 through 21 if a State has had its payment reduced under § 300.703(b), currently provided special education by each of the LEAs;</P>
                <P>(ii) If one or more LEAs are combined into a single new LEA, the State must combine the base allocations of the merged LEAs;</P>
                <P>(iii) If, for two or more LEAs, geographic boundaries or administrative responsibility for providing services to children with disabilities ages 3 through 21 change, the base allocations of affected LEAs must be redistributed among affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, or ages 6 through 21 if a State has had its payment reduced under § 300.703(b), currently provided special education by each affected LEA; and</P>
                <P>(iv) If an LEA received a base payment of zero in its first year of operation, the SEA must adjust the base payment for the first fiscal year after the first annual child count in which the LEA reports that it is serving any children with disabilities. The State must divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the LEAs that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities now being served by the LEA, among the LEA and affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, or ages 6 through 21 currently provided special education by each of the LEAs. This requirement takes effect with funds that become available on July 1, 2009.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Allocation of remaining funds.</E> After making allocations under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as adjusted by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the State must—</P>
                <P>(i) Allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those LEAs on the basis of the relative numbers of children enrolled in public and private elementary schools and secondary schools within the LEA's jurisdiction; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to those LEAs in accordance with their relative numbers of children living in poverty, as determined by the SEA.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Reallocation of LEA funds.</E> (1) If an SEA determines that an LEA is adequately providing FAPE to all children with disabilities residing in the area served by that agency with State and local funds, the SEA may reallocate any portion of the funds under this part that are not needed by that LEA to provide FAPE, to other LEAs in the <PRTPAGE P="113"/>State that are not adequately providing special education and related services to all children with disabilities residing in the areas served by those other LEAs. The SEA may also retain those funds for use at the State level to the extent the State has not reserved the maximum amount of funds it is permitted to reserve for State-level activities pursuant to § 300.704.</P>
                <P>(2) After an SEA distributes funds under this part to an eligible LEA that is not serving any children with disabilities, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the SEA must determine, within a reasonable period of time prior to the end of the carryover period in 34 CFR 76.709, whether the LEA has obligated the funds. The SEA may reallocate any of those funds not obligated by the LEA to other LEAs in the State that are not adequately providing special education and related services to all children with disabilities residing in the areas served by those other LEAs. The SEA may also retain those funds for use at the State level to the extent the State has not reserved the maximum amount of funds it is permitted to reserve for State-level activities pursuant to § 300.704.</P>

              <P>Except as otherwise provided, amounts provided to an LEA under Part B of the Act may be used only to pay the excess costs of providing special education and related services to children with disabilities. Excess costs are those costs for the education of an elementary school or secondary school student with a disability that are in excess of the average annual per student expenditure in an LEA during the preceding school year for an elementary school or secondary school student, as may be appropriate. An LEA must spend at least the average annual per student expenditure on the education of an elementary school or secondary school child with a disability before funds under Part B of the Act are used to pay the excess costs of providing special education and related services.</P>
              <P>Section 602(8) of the Act and § 300.16 require the LEA to compute the minimum average amount separately for children with disabilities in its elementary schools and for children with disabilities in its secondary schools. LEAs may not compute the minimum average amount it must spend on the education of children with disabilities based on a combination of the enrollments in its elementary schools and secondary schools.</P>
              <P>The following example shows how to compute the minimum average amount an LEA must spend for the education of each of its elementary school children with disabilities under section 602(3) of the Act before it may use funds under Part B of the Act.</P>

              <P>a. First the LEA must determine the total amount of its expenditures for elementary school students from all sources—local, State, and Federal (including Part B)—in the preceding school year. Only capital outlay and debt services are excluded.

              <P>Each LEA must expend, during the grant period, on the provision of special education and related services for the parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA an amount that is equal to—</P>
              <P>(1) A proportionate share of the LEA's subgrant under section 611(f) of the Act for children with disabilities aged 3 through 21. This is an amount that is the same proportion of the LEA's total subgrant under section 611(f) of the Act as the number of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities aged 3 through 21 enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA is to the total number of children with disabilities enrolled in public and private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA aged 3 through 21; and</P>
              <P>(2) A proportionate share of the LEA's subgrant under section 619(g) of the Act for children with disabilities aged 3 through 5. This is an amount that is the same proportion of the LEA's total subgrant under section 619(g) of the Act as the total number of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities aged 3 through 5 enrolled in private elementary schools located in the LEA is to the total number of children with disabilities enrolled in public and private elementary schools located in the LEA aged 3 through 5.</P>

              <P>Consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act and § 300.133 of these regulations, annual expenditures for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities are calculated based on the total number of children with disabilities enrolled in public and private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA eligible to receive special education and related services under Part B, as compared with the total number of eligible parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools located in the LEA. This ratio is used to determine the proportion of the LEA's total Part B subgrants under section 611(f) of the Act for children aged 3 through 21, and under section 619(g) of the Act for children aged 3 through 5, that is to be expended on services for parentally-<PRTPAGE P="123"/>placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA.</P>
              <P>The following is an example of how the proportionate share is calculated:</P>
              <P>There are 300 eligible children with disabilities enrolled in the Flintstone School District and 20 eligible parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA for a total of 320 eligible public and private school children with disabilities (note: proportionate share for parentally-placed private school children is based on total children eligible, not children served). The number of eligible parentally-placed private school children with disabilities (20) divided by the total number of eligible public and private school children with disabilities (320) indicates that 6.25 percent of the LEA's subgrant must be spent for the group of eligible parentally-placed children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA. Flintstone School District receives $152,500 in Federal flow through funds. Therefore, the LEA must spend $9,531.25 on special education or related services to the group of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA. (Note: The LEA must calculate the proportionate share of IDEA funds before earmarking funds for any early intervening activities in § 300.226).</P>
              <P>The following outlines the calculations for the example of how the proportionate share is calculated.</P>

Under section 674(e)(4) of the Act, the NIMAS applies to print instructional materials published after July 19, 2006. The purpose of the NIMAS is to help increase the availability and timely delivery of print instructional materials in accessible formats to blind or other persons with print disabilities in elementary and secondary schools.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Specifications—The Baseline Element Set</HD>
              <P>The Baseline Element Set details the minimum requirement that must be delivered to fulfill the NIMAS. It is the responsibility of publishers to provide this NIMAS-conformant XML content file, a package file (OPF), a PDF-format copy of the title page (or whichever page(s) contain(s) ISBN and copyright information), and a full set of the content's images. All of the images included within a work must be provided in a folder and placeholders entered in the relevant XML document indicating their location (all images must be included). The preferred image type is SVG, next is either PNG or JPG format. Images should be rendered in the same size/proportion as their originals at 300 dpi. Images should be named with relative path filenames in XML files (example: img id=“staricon4” src=“./images/U10C02/staricon4.jpg” alt=“star icon”).</P>

              <P>NIMAS-conformant content must be valid to the NIMAS 1.1 [see ANSI/NISO Z39.86 2005 or subsequent revisions]. In addition, files are required to use the tags from the Baseline Element Set when such tags are appropriate. Publishers are encouraged to augment the required Baseline Element Set with tags from the Optional Element Set (elements not included in the Standard) as applicable. For the purposes of NIMAS, appropriate usage of elements, both baseline <PRTPAGE P="124"/>and optional, is defined by the DAISY Structure Guidelines. Files that do not follow these guidelines in the selection and application of tags are not conformant to this Standard. Both optional elements and appropriate structure guidelines may be located within Z39.86-2002 and Z39.86-2005 available from <E T="03">http://www.daisy.org/z3986/.</E> Use of the most current standard is recommended.</P>

              <P>Publishers are encouraged to apply markup beyond the baseline (required) elements. The complete DTBook Element Set reflects the tags necessary to create the six types of Digital Talking Books and Braille output. Because of the present necessity to subdivide the creation of alternate format materials into distinct phases, the Panel determined that baseline elements would be provided by publishers, and optional elements would be added to the NIMAS-conformant files by <PRTPAGE P="126"/>third party conversion entities. In both circumstances the protocols for tagging digital files should conform to the most current ANSI/NISO Z39.86 specification. Content converters are directed to the most current DAISY Structure Guidelines (<E T="03">http://www.daisy.org/z3986/</E>) for guidance on their use.</P>
              <P>Since the publication of the original National File Format report from which the NIMAS technical specifications were derived, ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2002 was updated and is now ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005. It may be best to avoid using the following optional elements which are no longer included in ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005: style, notice, hr, and levelhd.</P>

              <P>Also, the following new elements were introduced by ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005 and should be considered optional elements for the NIMAS: bridgehead, byline, covertitle, dateline, epigraph, linegroup, and poem. Please refer to ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005 for additional information regarding these elements. To access the ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005 specification, go to <E T="03">http://www.daisy.org/z3986/.</E>

              <P>The most current DAISY/NISO standard, formally the <E T="03">ANSI/NISO Z39.86, Specifications for the Digital Talking Book</E> defines a comprehensive system for creating Digital Talking Books. A part of this standard is DTBook, an XML vocabulary that provides a core set of elements needed to produce most types of books. However, DTBook is not intended to be an exhaustive vocabulary for all types of books.</P>

              <P>Guidelines for the correct approach to extend the DAISY/NISO standard have been established. Mathematics, video support, testing, workbooks, music, dictionaries, chemistry, and searching are some of the extensions that have been discussed.

              <P>LEAs that seek to reduce their local maintenance of effort in accordance with § 300.205(d) and use some of their Part B funds for early intervening services under § 300.226 must do so with caution because the local <PRTPAGE P="127"/>maintenance of effort reduction provision and the authority to use Part B funds for early intervening services are interconnected. The decisions that an LEA makes about the amount of funds that it uses for one purpose affect the amount that it may use for the other. Below are examples that illustrate how §§ 300.205(d) and 300.226(a) affect one another.</P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
                <P>In this example, the amount that is 15 percent of the LEA's total grant (see § 300.226(a)), which is the maximum amount that the LEA may use for early intervening services (EIS), is greater than the amount that may be used for local maintenance of effort (MOE) reduction (50 percent of the increase in the LEA's grant from the prior year's grant) (see § 300.205(a)).</P>

              <P>Table 5 provides an example of how an LEA may meet the compliance standard using alternate methods from year to year without using the exceptions or adjustment in §§ 300.204 and 300.205, and provides information on the following scenario. In FY 2015-2016, the LEA meets the compliance standard using all four methods. As a result, in order to demonstrate that it met the compliance standard using any one of the four methods in FY 2016-2017, the LEA must expend at least as much as it did in FY 2015-2016 using that same method. Because the LEA spent the same amount in FY 2016-2017 as it did in FY 2015-2016, calculated using a combination of State and local funds and a combination of State and local funds on a per capita basis, the LEA met the compliance standard using both of those methods in FY 2016-2017. However, the LEA did not meet the compliance standard in FY 2016-2017 using the other two methods—local funds only or local funds only on a per capita basis—because it did not spend at least the same amount in FY 2016-<PRTPAGE P="129"/>2017 as it did in FY 2015-2016 using the same methods.</P>

                <P>(A) The types of services and the locations at which the services are provided;</P>
                <P>(B) The procedural safeguards that apply; and</P>

                <P>(4) The lead agency must continue to provide all early intervention services identified in the toddler with a disability's IFSP under § 303.344 (and consented to by the parent under § 303.342(e)) beyond age three until that toddler's initial eligibility determination under part B of the Act is made under 34 CFR 300.306. This provision does not apply if the LEA has requested parental consent for the initial evaluation under 34 CFR 300.300(a) and the parent has not provided that consent.</P>
                <P>(5) The lead agency must obtain informed consent from the parent of any child with a disability for the continuation of early intervention services pursuant to this section for that child.

                <P>(B) With the approval of the parents of the child, convening a transition conference, among the lead agency, the parents, and the LEA, not fewer than 90 days—and, at the discretion of all parties, not more than 9 months—before the child will no longer be eligible under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to receive, or no longer receives, early intervention services under this section, to discuss any services that the child may receive under part B of the Act; and</P>
                <P>(C) Establishing a transition plan in the IFSP not fewer than 90 days—and, at the discretion of all parties, not more than 9 months—before the child will no longer be eligible under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to receive, or no longer receives, early intervention services under this section.</P>

                <P>(7) In States that adopt the option to make services under this part available to children ages three and older pursuant to this section, there will be a referral to the part C system, dependent upon parental consent, of a child under the age of three who directly experiences a substantiated case of trauma due to exposure to family violence, as defined in section 320 of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, 42 U.S.C. 10401, <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Reporting requirement.</E> If a State includes in its application a State policy described in paragraph (a) of this section, the State must submit to the Secretary, in the State's report under § 303.124, the number and percentage of children with disabilities who are eligible for services under section 619 of the Act but whose parents choose for their children to continue to receive early intervention services under this part.<PRTPAGE P="198"/>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Available funds.</E> The State policy described in paragraph (a) of this section must describe the funds—including an identification as Federal, State, or local funds—that will be used to ensure that the option described in paragraph (a) of this section is available to eligible children and families who provide the consent described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, including fees, if any, to be charged to families as described in §§ 303.520 and 303.521.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Rules of construction.</E> (1) If a statewide system includes a State policy described in paragraph (a) of this section, a State that provides services in accordance with this section to a child with a disability who is eligible for services under section 619 of the Act will not be required to provide the child FAPE under part B of the Act for the period of time in which the child is receiving services under this part.</P>
                <P>(2) Nothing in this section may be construed to require a provider of services under this part to provide a child served under this part with FAPE.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Use of public benefits or public insurance to pay for part C services.</E> (1) A State may not use the public benefits or insurance of a child or parent to pay for part C services unless the State provides written notification, consistent with § 303.520(a)(3), to the child's parents, and the State meets the no-cost protections identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) With regard to using the public benefits or insurance of a child or parent to pay for part C services, the State—</P>

                <P>(A) Decrease available lifetime coverage or any other insured benefit for that child or parent under that program;</P>
                <P>(B) Result in the child's parents paying for services that would otherwise be covered by the public benefits or insurance program;</P>
                <P>(C) Result in any increase in premiums or discontinuation of public benefits or insurance for that child or that child's parents; or</P>
                <P>(D) Risk loss of eligibility for the child or that child's parents for home and community-based waivers based on aggregate health-related expenditures.</P>

                <P>(3) Prior to using a child's or parent's public benefits or insurance to pay for part C services, the State must provide written notification to the child's parents. The notification must include—</P>

                <P>(i) A statement that parental consent must be obtained under § 303.414, if that provision applies, before the State lead agency or EIS provider discloses, for billing purposes, a child's personally identifiable information to the State public agency responsible for the administration of the State's public benefits or insurance program (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Medicaid);</P>
                <P>(ii) A statement of the no-cost protection provisions in § 303.520(a)(2) and that if the parent does not provide the consent under § 303.520(a)(2), the State lead agency must still make available those part C services on the IFSP for which the parent has provided consent;</P>

                <P>(iii) A statement that the parents have the right under § 303.414, if that provision applies, to withdraw their consent to disclosure of personally identifiable information to the State public agency responsible for the administration of the State's public benefits or insurance program (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Medicaid) at any time; and</P>

                <P>(iv) A statement of the general categories of costs that the parent would incur as a result of participating in a public benefits or insurance program (such as co-payments or deductibles, or the required use of private insurance as the primary insurance).<PRTPAGE P="231"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) If a State requires a parent to pay any costs that the parent would incur as a result of the State's using a child's or parent's public benefits or insurance to pay for part C services (such as co-payments or deductibles, or the required use of private insurance as the primary insurance), those costs must be identified in the State's system of payments policies under § 303.521 and included in the notification provided to the parent under paragraph (a)(3) of this section; otherwise, the State cannot charge those costs to the parent.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of private insurance to pay for Part C services.</E> (1)(i) The State may not use the private insurance of a parent of an infant or toddler with a disability to pay for part C services unless the parent provides parental consent, consistent with §§ 303.7 and 303.420(a)(4), to use private insurance to pay for part C services for his or her child or the State meets one of the exceptions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This includes the use of private insurance when such use is a prerequisite for the use of public benefits or insurance. Parental consent must be obtained—</P>
                <P>(A) When the lead agency or EIS provider seeks to use the parent's private insurance or benefits to pay for the initial provision of an early intervention service in the IFSP; and</P>
                <P>(B) Each time consent for services is required under § 303.420(a)(3) due to an increase (in frequency, length, duration, or intensity) in the provision of services in the child's IFSP.</P>
                <P>(ii) If a State requires a parent to pay any costs that the parent would incur as a result of the State's use of private insurance to pay for early intervention services (such as co-payments, premiums, or deductibles), those costs must be identified in the State's system of payments policies under § 303.521; otherwise, the State may not charge those costs to the parent.</P>
                <P>(iii) When obtaining parental consent required under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section or initially using benefits under a child or parent's private insurance policy to pay for an early intervention service under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the State must provide to the parent a copy of the State's system of payments policies that identifies the potential costs that the parent may incur when their private insurance is used to pay for early intervention services under this part (such as co-payments, premiums, or deductibles or other long-term costs such as the loss of benefits because of annual or lifetime health insurance coverage caps under the insurance policy).</P>
                <P>(2) The parental consent requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply if the State has enacted a State statute regarding private health insurance coverage for early intervention services under part C of the Act, that expressly provides that—</P>
                <P>(i) The use of private health insurance to pay for part C services cannot count towards or result in a loss of benefits due to the annual or lifetime health insurance coverage caps for the infant or toddler with a disability, the parent, or the child's family members who are covered under that health insurance policy;</P>
                <P>(ii) The use of private health insurance to pay for part C services cannot negatively affect the availability of health insurance to the infant or toddler with a disability, the parent, or the child's family members who are covered under that health insurance policy, and health insurance coverage may not be discontinued for these individuals due to the use of the health insurance to pay for services under part C of the Act; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The use of private health insurance to pay for part C services cannot be the basis for increasing the health insurance premiums of the infant or toddler with a disability, the parent, or the child's family members covered under that health insurance policy.</P>
                <P>(3) If a State has enacted a State statute that meets the requirements in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, regarding the use of private health insurance coverage to pay for early intervention services under part C of the Act, the State may reestablish a new baseline of State and local expenditures under § 303.225(b) in the next Federal fiscal year following the effective date of the statute.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Inability to pay.</E> If a parent or family of an infant or toddler with a disability is determined unable to pay under the State's definition of inability to pay under § 303.521(a)(3) and does not <PRTPAGE P="232"/>provide consent under paragraph (b)(1), the lack of consent may not be used to delay or deny any services under this part to that child or family.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Proceeds or funds from public insurance or benefits or from private insurance.</E> (1) Proceeds or funds from public insurance or benefits or from private insurance are not treated as program income for purposes of 2 CFR 200.307.</P>

                <P>(2) If the State receives reimbursements from Federal funds (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Medicaid reimbursements attributable directly to Federal funds) for services under part C of the Act, those funds are considered neither State nor local funds under § 303.225(b).</P>
                <P>(3) If the State spends funds from private insurance for services under this part, those funds are considered neither State nor local funds under § 303.225.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Funds received from a parent or family member under a State's system of payments.</E> Funds received by the State from a parent or family member under the State's system of payments established under § 303.521 are considered program income under 2 CFR 200.307. These funds—</P>
                <P>(1) Are not deducted from the total allowable costs charged under part C of the Act (as set forth in 2 CFR 200.307(e)(1));</P>

                <P>(i) A determination by qualified personnel that the applicant has a physical or mental impairment;</P>
                <P>(ii) A determination by qualified personnel that the applicant's physical or mental impairment constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment for the applicant; and</P>
                <P>(iii) A determination by a qualified vocational rehabilitation counselor employed by the designated State unit that the applicant requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, secure, retain, advance in, or regain employment that is consistent with the individual's unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interest, and informed choice. For purposes of an assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs under this part, an individual is presumed to have a goal of an employment outcome.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Presumption of benefit.</E> The designated State unit must presume that an applicant who meets the eligibility requirements in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section can benefit in terms of an employment outcome.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Presumption of eligibility for Social Security recipients and beneficiaries.</E> (i) Any applicant who has been determined eligible for Social Security benefits under title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act is—</P>
                <P>(A) Presumed eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(B) Considered an individual with a significant disability as defined in § 361.5(c)(29).</P>
                <P>(ii) If an applicant for vocational rehabilitation services asserts that he or she is eligible for Social Security benefits under title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act (and, therefore, is presumed eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section), but is unable to provide appropriate evidence, such as an award letter, to support that assertion, the State unit must verify the applicant's eligibility under title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act by contacting the Social Security Administration. This verification must be made within a reasonable period of time that enables the State unit to determine the applicant's eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services within 60 days of the individual submitting an application for services in accordance with § 361.41(b)(2).</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Achievement of an employment outcome.</E> Any eligible individual, including an individual whose eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services is based on the individual being eligible for Social Security benefits under title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act, must intend to achieve an employment outcome that is consistent with the applicant's unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice.</P>
                <P>(i) The State unit is responsible for informing individuals, through its application process for vocational rehabilitation services, that individuals who receive services under the program must intend to achieve an employment outcome.</P>
                <P>(ii) The applicant's completion of the application process for vocational rehabilitation services is sufficient evidence of the individual's intent to achieve an employment outcome, and no additional demonstration on the part of the applicant is required for purposes of satisfying paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Interpretation.</E> Nothing in this section, including paragraph (a)(3)(i), is to be construed to create an entitlement to any vocational rehabilitation service.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Interim determination of eligibility.</E> (1) The designated State unit may initiate the provision of vocational rehabilitation services for an applicant on the basis of an interim determination of eligibility prior to the 60-day period described in § 361.41(b)(2).</P>

                <P>(2) If a State chooses to make interim determinations of eligibility, the designated State unit must—<PRTPAGE P="327"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) Establish criteria and conditions for making those determinations;</P>
                <P>(ii) Develop and implement procedures for making the determinations; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Determine the scope of services that may be provided pending the final determination of eligibility.</P>
                <P>(3) If a State elects to use an interim eligibility determination, the designated State unit must make a final determination of eligibility within 60 days of the individual submitting an application for services in accordance with § 361.41(b)(2).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Prohibited factors.</E> (1) The vocational rehabilitation services portion of the Unified or Combined State Plan must assure that the State unit will not impose, as part of determining eligibility under this section, a duration of residence requirement that excludes from services any applicant who is present in the State. The designated State unit may not require the applicant to demonstrate a presence in the State through the production of any documentation that under State or local law, or practical circumstances, results in a de facto duration of residence requirement.</P>
                <P>(2) In making a determination of eligibility under this section, the designated State unit also must ensure that—</P>
                <P>(i) No applicant or group of applicants is excluded or found ineligible solely on the basis of the type of disability; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The eligibility requirements are applied without regard to the—</P>
                <P>(A) Age, sex, race, color, or national origin of the applicant;</P>
                <P>(B) Type of expected employment outcome;</P>
                <P>(C) Source of referral for vocational rehabilitation services;</P>
                <P>(D) Particular service needs or anticipated cost of services required by an applicant or the income level of an applicant or applicant's family;</P>
                <P>(E) Applicants' employment history or current employment status; and</P>
                <P>(F) Applicants' educational status or current educational credential.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Review and assessment of data for eligibility determination.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the designated State unit—</P>
                <P>(1) Must base its determination of each of the basic eligibility requirements in paragraph (a) of this section on—</P>
                <P>(i) A review and assessment of existing data, including counselor observations, education records, information provided by the individual or the individual's family, particularly information used by education officials, and determinations made by officials of other agencies; and</P>
                <P>(ii) To the extent existing data do not describe the current functioning of the individual or are unavailable, insufficient, or inappropriate to make an eligibility determination, an assessment of additional data resulting from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services, including trial work experiences, assistive technology devices and services, personal assistance services, and any other support services that are necessary to determine whether an individual is eligible; and</P>
                <P>(2) Must base its presumption under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section that an applicant who has been determined eligible for Social Security benefits under title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act satisfies each of the basic eligibility requirements in paragraph (a) of this section on determinations made by the Social Security Administration.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Trial work experiences for individuals with significant disabilities.</E> (1) Prior to any determination that an individual with a disability is unable to benefit from vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment outcome because of the severity of that individual's disability or that the individual is ineligible for vocational rehabilitation services, the designated State unit must conduct an exploration of the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in realistic work situations.</P>

                <P>(2)(i) The designated State unit must develop a written plan to assess periodically the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in competitive integrated work situations through the use of trial work experiences, which must be provided in competitive integrated employment settings to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the informed choice <PRTPAGE P="328"/>and rehabilitation needs of the individual.</P>
                <P>(ii) Trial work experiences include supported employment, on-the-job training, and other experiences using realistic integrated work settings.</P>
                <P>(iii) Trial work experiences must be of sufficient variety and over a sufficient period of time for the designated State unit to determine that—</P>
                <P>(A) There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the individual can benefit from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment outcome; or</P>
                <P>(B) There is clear and convincing evidence that due to the severity of the individual's disability, the individual is incapable of benefitting from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment outcome; and</P>
                <P>(iv) The designated State unit must provide appropriate supports, including, but not limited to, assistive technology devices and services and personal assistance services, to accommodate the rehabilitation needs of the individual during the trial work experiences.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Data for determination of priority for services under an order of selection.</E> If the designated State unit is operating under an order of selection for services, as provided in § 361.36, the State unit must base its priority assignments on—</P>
                <P>(1) A review of the data that was developed under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section to make the eligibility determination; and</P>
                <P>(2) An assessment of additional data, to the extent necessary.</P>

                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Clear and convincing evidence</E> means that the designated State unit has a high degree of certainty before it can conclude that an individual is incapable of benefiting from services in terms of an employment outcome. The clear and convincing standard constitutes the highest standard used in our civil system of law and is to be individually applied on a case-by-case basis. The term <E T="03">clear</E> means unequivocal. For example, the use of an intelligence test result alone would not constitute clear and convincing evidence. Clear and convincing evidence might include a description of assessments, including situational assessments and supported employment assessments, from service providers who have concluded that they would be unable to meet the individual's needs due to the severity of the individual's disability. The demonstration of “clear and convincing evidence” must include, if appropriate, a functional assessment of skill development activities, with any necessary supports (including assistive technology), in real life settings.

                <P>(i) Not so low as to effectively deny an individual a necessary service; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Not absolute and permits exceptions so that individual needs can be addressed.</P>
                <P>(3) The State unit may not place absolute dollar limits on specific service categories or on the total services provided to an individual.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Duration of services.</E> (1) The State unit may establish reasonable time periods for the provision of services provided that the time periods are—</P>
                <P>(i) Not so short as to effectively deny an individual a necessary service; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Not absolute and permit exceptions so that individual needs can be addressed.</P>
                <P>(2) The State unit may not establish absolute time limits on the provision of specific services or on the provision of services to an individual.

              <SUBJECT>What is the development, submission, and approval process of the Combined State Plan?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For purposes of § 361.140(a), if a State chooses to develop a Combined State Plan it must submit the Combined State Plan in accordance with the requirements described below and sec. 103 of WIOA, as explained in the joint planning guidelines issued by the Secretaries of Labor and Education.</P>
              <P>(b) The Combined State Plan must be developed with the assistance of the State WDB, as required by 20 CFR 679.130(a) and WIOA sec. 101(d), and must be developed in coordination with administrators with optimum policy-making authority for the core programs and required one-stop partners.</P>
              <P>(c) The State must provide an opportunity for public comment on and input into the development of the Combined State Plan prior to its submission.</P>
              <P>(1) The opportunity for public comment for the portions of the Combined State Plan that cover the core programs must include an opportunity for comment by representatives of Local WDBs and chief elected officials, businesses, representatives of labor organizations, community-based organizations, adult education providers, institutions of higher education, other stakeholders with an interest in the services provided by the six core programs, and the general public, including individuals with disabilities.</P>
              <P>(2) Consistent with the “Sunshine Provision” of WIOA in sec. 101(g), the State WDB must make information regarding the Combined State Plan available to the public through electronic means and regularly occurring open meetings in accordance with State law. The Combined State Plan must describe the State's process and timeline for ensuring a meaningful opportunity for public comment on the portions of the plan covering core programs.</P>
              <P>(3) The portions of the plan that cover the Combined State Plan partner programs are subject to any public comment requirements applicable to those programs.</P>
              <P>(d) The State must submit to the Secretaries of Labor and Education and to the Secretary of the agency with responsibility for approving the program's plan or deeming it complete under the law governing the program, as part of its Combined State Plan, any plan, application, form, or any other similar document that is required as a condition for the approval of Federal funding under the applicable program or activity. Such submission must occur in accordance with a process identified by the relevant Secretaries in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) The Combined State Plan will be approved or disapproved in accordance with the requirements of sec. 103(c) of WIOA.</P>

              <P>(1) The portion of the Combined State Plan covering programs administered by the Departments of Labor and Education must be reviewed, and approved or disapproved, by the appropriate Secretary within 90 days beginning on the day the Combined State Plan is received by the appropriate Secretary from the State, consistent <PRTPAGE P="358"/>with paragraph (f) of this section. Before the Secretaries of Labor and Education approve the Combined State Plan, the vocational rehabilitation services portion of the Combined State Plan described in WIOA sec. 102(b)(2)(D)(iii) must be approved by the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration.</P>
              <P>(2) If an appropriate Secretary other than the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Education has authority to approve or deem complete a portion of the Combined State Plan for a program or activity described in § 361.140(d), that portion of the Combined State Plan must be reviewed, and approved, disapproved, or deemed complete, by the appropriate Secretary within 120 days beginning on the day the Combined State Plan is received by the appropriate Secretary from the State consistent with paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) The appropriate Secretaries will review and approve or deem complete the Combined State Plan within 90 or 120 days, as appropriate, as described in paragraph (e) of this section, unless the Secretaries of Labor and Education or appropriate Secretary have determined in writing within that period that:</P>
              <P>(1) The Combined State Plan is inconsistent with the requirements of the six core programs or the Federal laws authorizing or applicable to the program or activity involved, including the criteria for approval of a plan or application, or deeming the plan complete, if any, under such law;</P>
              <P>(2) The portion of the Combined State Plan describing the six core programs or the program or activity described in paragraph (a) of this section involved does not satisfy the criteria as provided in sec. 102 or 103 of WIOA, as applicable; or</P>
              <P>(3) The Combined State Plan is incomplete, or otherwise insufficient to determine whether it is consistent with a core program's requirements, other requirements of WIOA, or the Federal laws authorizing, or applicable to, the program or activity described in § 361.140(d), including the criteria for approval of a plan or application, if any, under such law.</P>
              <P>(g) If the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Education, or the appropriate Secretary does not make the written determination described in paragraph (f) of this section within the relevant period of time after submission of the Combined State Plan, that portion of the Combined State Plan over which the Secretary has jurisdiction will be considered approved.</P>
              <P>(h) The Secretaries of Labor and Education's written determination of approval or disapproval regarding the portion of the plan for the six core programs may be separate from the written determination of approval, disapproval, or completeness of the program-specific requirements of Combined State Plan partner programs and activities described in § 361.140(d) and included in the Combined State Plan.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Special rule.</E> In paragraphs (f)(1) and (3) of this section, the term “criteria for approval of a plan or application,” with respect to a State or a core program or a program under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), includes a requirement for agreement between the State and the appropriate Secretaries regarding State performance measures or State performance accountability measures, as the case may be, including levels of performance.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for modifications of the Combined State Plan?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For the core program portions of the Combined State Plan, modifications are required, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(1) By the end of the first 2-year period of any 4-year State Plan. The State WDB must review the Combined State Plan, and the Governor must submit modifications to the Combined State Plan to reflect changes in labor market and economic conditions or other factors affecting the implementation of the Combined State Plan;</P>
              <P>(2) When changes in Federal or State law or policy substantially affect the strategies, goals, and priorities upon which the Combined State Plan is based;</P>

              <P>(3) When there are changes in the statewide vision, strategies, policies, State negotiated levels of performance <PRTPAGE P="359"/>as described in § 361.170(b), the methodology used to determine local allocation of funds, reorganizations that change the working relationship with system employees, changes in organizational responsibilities, changes to the membership structure of the State WDB or alternative entity, and similar substantial changes to the State's workforce development system.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the required modification review described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a State may submit a modification of its Combined State Plan at any time during the 4-year period of the plan.</P>
              <P>(c) For any Combined State Plan partner programs and activities described in § 361.140(d) that are included in a State's Combined State Plan, the State—</P>
              <P>(1) May decide if the modification requirements under WIOA sec. 102(c)(3) that apply to the core programs will apply to the Combined State Plan partner programs, as long as consistent with any other modification requirements for the programs, or may comply with the requirements applicable to only the particular program or activity; and</P>
              <P>(2) Must submit, in accordance with the procedure described in § 361.143, any modification, amendment, or revision required by the Federal law authorizing, or applicable to, the Combined State Plan partner program or activity.</P>

              <P>(i) If the underlying programmatic requirements change (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the authorizing statute is reauthorized) for Federal laws authorizing such programs, a State must either modify its Combined State Plan or submit a separate plan to the appropriate Federal agency in accordance with the new Federal law authorizing the Combined State Plan partner program or activity and other legal requirements applicable to such program or activity.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the modification, amendment, or revision affects the administration of only that particular Combined State Plan partner program and has no impact on the Combined State Plan as a whole or the integration and administration of the core and other Combined State Plan partner programs at the State level, modifications must be submitted for approval to only the appropriate Secretary, based on the approval standards applicable to the original Combined State Plan under § 361.143, if the State elects, or in accordance with the procedures and requirements applicable to the particular Combined State Plan partner program.</P>
              <P>(3) A State also may amend its Combined State Plan to add a Combined State Plan partner program or activity described in § 361.140(d).</P>
              <P>(d) Modifications of the Combined State Plan are subject to the same public review and comment requirements that apply to the development of the original Combined State Plan as described in § 361.143(c) except that, if the modification, amendment, or revision affects the administration of a particular Combined State Plan partner program and has no impact on the Combined State Plan as a whole or the integration and administration of the core and other Combined State Plan partner programs at the State level, a State may comply instead with the procedures and requirements applicable to the particular Combined State Plan partner program.</P>
              <P>(e) Modifications for the core program portions of the Combined State Plan must be approved by the Secretaries of Labor and Education, based on the approval standards applicable to the original Combined State Plan under § 361.143. This approval must come after the approval of the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration for modification of any portion of the Combined State Plan described in sec. 102(b)(2)(D)(iii) of WIOA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What definitions apply to Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act performance accountability provisions?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Participant.</E> A reportable individual who has received services other than the services described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, after satisfying all applicable programmatic requirements for the provision of services, such as eligibility determination.</P>
              <P>(1) For the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program, a participant is a reportable individual who has an approved and signed Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) and has begun to receive services.</P>
              <P>(2) For the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) title I youth program, a participant is a reportable individual who has satisfied all applicable program requirements for the provision of services, including eligibility determination, an objective assessment, and development of an individual service strategy, and received 1 of the 14 WIOA youth program elements identified in sec. 129(c)(2) of WIOA.</P>
              <P>(3) The following individuals are not participants:</P>
              <P>(i) Individuals in an Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) program who have not completed at least 12 contact hours;</P>
              <P>(ii) Individuals who only use the self-service system.</P>
              <P>(A) Subject to paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, self-service occurs when individuals independently access any workforce development system program's information and activities in either a physical location, such as a one-stop center resource room or partner agency, or remotely via the use of electronic technologies.</P>
              <P>(B) Self-service does not uniformly apply to all virtually accessed services. For example, virtually accessed services that provide a level of support beyond independent job or information seeking on the part of an individual would not qualify as self-service.</P>
              <P>(iii) Individuals who receive information-only services or activities, which provide readily available information that does not require an assessment by a staff member of the individual's skills, education, or career objectives.</P>
              <P>(4) Programs must include participants in their performance calculations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reportable individual.</E> An individual who has taken action that demonstrates an intent to use program services and who meets specific reporting criteria of the program, including:</P>
              <P>(1) Individuals who provide identifying information;</P>
              <P>(2) Individuals who only use the self-service system; or</P>
              <P>(3) Individuals who only receive information-only services or activities.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exit.</E> As defined for the purpose of performance calculations, exit is the point after which a participant who has received services through any program meets the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) For the adult, dislocated worker, and youth programs authorized under WIOA title I, the AEFLA program authorized under WIOA title II, and the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III, exit date is the last date of service.</P>
              <P>(i) The last day of service cannot be determined until at least 90 days have elapsed since the participant last received services; services do not include self-service, information-only services or activities, or follow-up services. This also requires that there are no plans to provide the participant with future services.</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved].</P>
              <P>(2)(i) For the VR program authorized under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by WIOA title IV (VR program):</P>
              <P>(A) The participant's record of service is closed in accordance with § 361.56 because the participant has achieved an employment outcome; or</P>
              <P>(B) The participant's service record is closed because the individual has not achieved an employment outcome or the individual has been determined ineligible after receiving services in accordance with § 361.43.</P>

              <P>(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a participant will not be considered as meeting the definition of exit from the VR program if the participant's service record is closed because the participant has <PRTPAGE P="361"/>achieved a supported employment outcome in an integrated setting but not in competitive integrated employment.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) A State may implement a common exit policy for all or some of the core programs in WIOA title I and the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III, and any additional required partner program(s) listed in sec. 121(b)(1)(B) of WIOA that is under the authority of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).</P>
              <P>(ii) If a State chooses to implement a common exit policy, the policy must require that a participant is exited only when all of the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are met for the WIOA title I core programs and the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III, as well as any additional required partner programs listed in sec. 121(b)(1)(B) of WIOA under the authority of DOL to which the common exit policy applies in which the participant is enrolled.</P>

              <P>(a) States' negotiated levels of performance will be adjusted through the application of the statistical adjustment model established under § 361.170 <PRTPAGE P="366"/>to account for actual economic conditions experienced during a program year and characteristics of participants, annually at the close of each program year.</P>
              <P>(b) Any State that fails to meet adjusted levels of performance for the primary indicators of performance outlined in § 361.155 for any year will receive technical assistance, including assistance in the development of a performance improvement plan provided by the Secretary of Labor or Secretary of Education.</P>
              <P>(c) Whether a State has failed to meet adjusted levels of performance will be determined using the following three criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) The overall State program score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved by a core program on the primary indicators of performance to the adjusted levels of performance for that core program. The average of the percentages achieved of the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators by a core program will constitute the overall State program score.</P>
              <P>(2) However, until all indicators for the core program have at least 2 years of complete data, the overall State program score will be based on a comparison of the actual results achieved to the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators that have at least 2 years of complete data for that program;</P>
              <P>(3) The overall State indicator score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved on a primary indicator of performance by all core programs in a State to the adjusted levels of performance for that primary indicator. The average of the percentages achieved of the adjusted level of performance by all of the core programs on that indicator will constitute the overall State indicator score.</P>
              <P>(4) However, until all indicators for the State have at least 2 years of complete data, the overall State indicator score will be based on a comparison of the actual results achieved to the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators that have at least 2 years of complete data in a State.</P>
              <P>(5) The individual indicator score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved by each core program on each of the individual primary indicators to the adjusted levels of performance for each of the program's primary indicators of performance.</P>
              <P>(d) A performance failure occurs when:</P>
              <P>(1) Any overall State program score or overall State indicator score falls below 90 percent for the program year; or</P>
              <P>(2) Any of the States' individual indicator scores fall below 50 percent for the program year.</P>
              <P>(e) Sanctions based on performance failure will be applied to States if, for 2 consecutive years, the State fails to meet:</P>
              <P>(1) 90 percent of the overall State program score for the same core program;</P>
              <P>(2) 90 percent of the overall State indicator score for the same primary indicator; or</P>

              <P>(1) The State fails to submit the State annual performance reports as required under WIOA sec. 116(d)(2), as defined in § 361.185;</P>
              <P>(2) The State fails to meet State adjusted levels of performance for the same primary performance indicator(s) under either § 361.190(d)(1) for the second consecutive year as defined in § 361.190; or</P>
              <P>(3) The State's score on the same indicator for the same program falls below 50 percent under § 361.190(d)(2) for the second consecutive year as defined in § 361.190.</P>

              <P>(b) If the State fails under paragraphs (a)(1) and either (a)(2) or (3) of this section in the same program year, the Secretaries of Labor and Education <PRTPAGE P="367"/>will reduce the Governor's Reserve Allotment by 10 percent of the maximum available amount for the immediately succeeding program year.</P>
              <P>(c) If a State's Governor's Reserve Allotment is reduced:</P>
              <P>(1) The reduced amount will not be returned to the State in the event that the State later improves performance or submits its annual performance report; and</P>
              <P>(2) The Governor's Reserve will continue to be set at the reduced level in each subsequent year until the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Education, depending on which program is impacted, determines that the State met the State adjusted levels of performance for the applicable primary performance indicators and has submitted all of the required performance reports.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the one-stop delivery system?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The one-stop delivery system brings together workforce development, educational, and other human resource services in a seamless customer-focused service delivery network that enhances access to the programs' services and improves long-term employment outcomes for individuals receiving assistance. One-stop partners administer separately funded programs as a set of integrated streamlined services to customers.</P>
              <P>(b) Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) assigns responsibilities at the local, State, and Federal level to ensure the creation and maintenance of a one-stop delivery system that enhances the range and quality of education and workforce development services that employers and individual customers can access.</P>
              <P>(c) The system must include at least one comprehensive physical center in each local area as described in § 361.305.</P>
              <P>(d) The system may also have additional arrangements to supplement the comprehensive center. These arrangements include:</P>
              <P>(1) An affiliated site or a network of affiliated sites, where one or more partners make programs, services, and activities available, as described in § 361.310;</P>
              <P>(2) A network of eligible one-stop partners, as described in §§ 361.400 through 361.410, through which each partner provides one or more of the programs, services, and activities that are linked, physically or technologically, to an affiliated site or access point that assures customers are provided information on the availability of career services, as well as other program services and activities, regardless of where they initially enter the public workforce system in the local area; and</P>
              <P>(3) Specialized centers that address specific needs, including those of dislocated workers, youth, or key industry sectors, or clusters.</P>
              <P>(e) Required one-stop partner programs must provide access to programs, services, and activities through electronic means if applicable and practicable. This is in addition to providing access to services through the mandatory comprehensive physical one-stop center and any affiliated sites or specialized centers. The provision of programs and services by electronic methods such as Web sites, telephones, or other means must improve the efficiency, coordination, and quality of one-stop partner services. Electronic delivery must not replace access to such services at a comprehensive one-stop center or be a substitute to making services available at an affiliated site if the partner is participating in an affiliated site. Electronic delivery systems must be in compliance with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of WIOA sec. 188 and its implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 38.</P>
              <P>(f) The design of the local area's one-stop delivery system must be described in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) executed with the one-stop partners, described in § 361.500.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is a comprehensive one-stop center and what must be provided there?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A comprehensive one-stop center is a physical location where job seeker and employer customers can access the programs, services, and activities of all required one-stop partners. A comprehensive one-stop center must have at least one title I staff person physically present.</P>
              <P>(b) The comprehensive one-stop center must provide:</P>
              <P>(1) Career services, described in § 361.430;</P>
              <P>(2) Access to training services described in 20 CFR 680.200;</P>
              <P>(3) Access to any employment and training activities carried out under sec. 134(d) of WIOA;</P>
              <P>(4) Access to programs and activities carried out by one-stop partners listed in §§ 361.400 through 361.410, including the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III (Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service program); and</P>
              <P>(5) Workforce and labor market information.</P>

              <P>(c) Customers must have access to these programs, services, and activities during regular business days at a comprehensive one-stop center. The Local <PRTPAGE P="372"/>Workforce Development Board (WDB) may establish other service hours at other times to accommodate the schedules of individuals who work on regular business days. The State WDB will evaluate the hours of access to service as part of the evaluation of effectiveness in the one-stop certification process described in § 361.800(b).</P>
              <P>(d) “Access” to each partner program and its services means:</P>
              <P>(1) Having a program staff member physically present at the one-stop center;</P>
              <P>(2) Having a staff member from a different partner program physically present at the one-stop center appropriately trained to provide information to customers about the programs, services, and activities available through partner programs; or</P>
              <P>(3) Making available a direct linkage through technology to program staff who can provide meaningful information or services.</P>
              <P>(i) A “direct linkage” means providing direct connection at the one-stop center, within a reasonable time, by phone or through a real-time Web-based communication to a program staff member who can provide program information or services to the customer.</P>
              <P>(ii) A “direct linkage” cannot exclusively be providing a phone number or computer Web site or providing information, pamphlets, or materials.</P>
              <P>(e) All comprehensive one-stop centers must be physically and programmatically accessible to individuals with disabilities, as described in 29 CFR part 38, the implementing regulations of WIOA sec. 188.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is an affiliated site and what must be provided there?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An affiliated site, or affiliate one-stop center, is a site that makes available to job seeker and employer customers one or more of the one-stop partners' programs, services, and activities. An affiliated site does not need to provide access to every required one-stop partner program. The frequency of program staff's physical presence in the affiliated site will be determined at the local level. Affiliated sites are access points in addition to the comprehensive one-stop center(s) in each local area. If used by local areas as a part of the service delivery strategy, affiliate sites must be implemented in a manner that supplements and enhances customer access to services.</P>
              <P>(b) As described in § 361.315, Wagner-Peyser Act employment services cannot be a stand-alone affiliated site.</P>
              <P>(c) States, in conjunction with the Local WDBs, must examine lease agreements and property holdings throughout the one-stop delivery system in order to use property in an efficient and effective way. Where necessary and appropriate, States and Local WDBs must take expeditious steps to align lease expiration dates with efforts to consolidate one-stop operations into service points where Wagner-Peyser Act employment services are colocated as soon as reasonably possible. These steps must be included in the State Plan.</P>
              <P>(d) All affiliated sites must be physically and programmatically accessible to individuals with disabilities, as described in 29 CFR part 38, the implementing regulations of WIOA sec. 188.</P>

              <P>(a) Separate stand-alone Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service offices are not permitted under WIOA, as also described in 20 CFR 652.202.</P>
              <P>(b) If Wagner-Peyser Act employment services are provided at an affiliated site, there must be at least one or more other partners in the affiliated site with a physical presence of combined staff more than 50 percent of the time the center is open. Additionally, the other partner must not be the partner administering local veterans' employment representatives, disabled veterans' outreach program specialists, or unemployment compensation programs. If Wagner-Peyser Act employment services and any of these 3 programs are provided at an affiliated site, an additional partner or partners must have a presence of combined staff in the center more than 50 percent of the time the center is open.</P>

              <P>Any network of one-stop partners or specialized centers, as described in § 361.300(d)(3), must be connected to the comprehensive one-stop center and any appropriate affiliate one-stop centers, for example, by having processes in place to make referrals to these centers and the partner programs located in them. Wagner-Peyser Act employment services cannot stand alone in a specialized center. Just as described in § 361.315 for an affiliated site, a specialized center must include other programs besides Wagner-Peyser Act employment services, local veterans' employment representatives, disabled veterans' outreach program specialists, and unemployment compensation.</P>

              <P>(d) When fully executed, the MOU must contain the signatures of the Local WDB, one-stop partners, the chief elected official(s), and the time period in which the agreement is effective. The MOU must be updated not less than every 3 years to reflect any changes in the signatory official of the Board, one-stop partners, and chief elected officials, or one-stop infrastructure funding.<PRTPAGE P="379"/>

              <P>(b) Local WDBs and one-stop partners must establish, in the MOU, how they will fund the infrastructure costs and other shared costs of the one-stop centers. If agreement regarding infrastructure costs is not reached when other sections of the MOU are ready, an interim infrastructure funding agreement may be included instead, as described in § 361.715(c). Once agreement on infrastructure funding is reached, the Local WDB and one-stop partners must amend the MOU to include the infrastructure funding of the one-stop centers. Infrastructure funding is described in detail in §§ 361.700 through 361.760.</P>
              <P>(c) The Local WDB must report to the State WDB, Governor, and relevant State agency when MOU negotiations with one-stop partners have reached an impasse.</P>
              <P>(1) The Local WDB and partners must document the negotiations and efforts that have taken place in the MOU. The State WDB, one-stop partner programs, and the Governor may consult with the appropriate Federal agencies to address impasse situations related to issues other than infrastructure funding after attempting to address the impasse. Impasses related to infrastructure cost funding must be resolved using the State infrastructure cost funding mechanism described in § 361.730.</P>
              <P>(2) The Local WDB must report failure to execute an MOU with a required partner to the Governor, State WDB, and the State agency responsible for administering the partner's program. Additionally, if the State cannot assist the Local WDB in resolving the impasse, the Governor or the State WDB must report the failure to the Secretary of Labor and to the head of any other Federal agency with responsibility for oversight of a partner's program.</P>

              <P>(a) At a minimum, the one-stop operator must coordinate the service delivery of required one-stop partners and service providers. Local WDBs may establish additional roles of one-stop operator, including, but not limited to: Coordinating service providers across the one-stop delivery system, being the primary provider of services within the center, providing some of the services within the center, or coordinating service delivery in a multi-center area, which may include affiliated sites. The competition for a one-stop operator must clearly articulate the role of the one-stop operator.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a one-stop operator may not perform the following functions: Convene system stakeholders to assist in the development of the local plan; prepare and submit local plans (as required under sec. 107 of WIOA); be responsible for oversight of itself; manage or significantly participate in the competitive selection process for one-stop operators; select or terminate one-stop operators, career services, and youth providers; negotiate local performance accountability measures; or develop and submit budget for activities of the Local WDB in the local area.</P>
              <P>(2) An entity serving as a one-stop operator, that also serves a different role within the one-stop delivery system, may perform some or all of these functions when it is acting in its other role, if it has established sufficient firewalls and conflict of interest policies and procedures. The policies and procedures must conform to the specifications in 20 CFR 679.430 for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflict of interest.</P>

              <P>Yes, but there must be appropriate firewalls in place in regards to the competition, and subsequent oversight, monitoring, and evaluation of performance of the service provider. The operator cannot develop, manage, or conduct the competition of a service provider in which it intends to compete. In cases where an operator is also a service provider, there must be firewalls and internal controls within the operator-service provider entity, as well as specific policies and procedures at the Local WDB level regarding oversight, monitoring, and evaluation of performance of the service provider. The firewalls must conform to the specifications in 20 CFR 679.430 for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflicts of interest.</P>

The Local WDB and one-stop operator must establish a system for management of merit staff in accordance with State policies and procedures. Continued use of State <PRTPAGE P="382"/>merit staff for the provision of Wagner-Peyser Act services or services from other programs with merit staffing requirements must be included in the competition for and final contract with the one-stop operator when Wagner-Peyser Act services or services from other programs with merit staffing requirements are being provided.</P>

              <P>(a) In the local funding mechanism, the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners agree to amounts and methods of calculating amounts each partner will contribute for one-stop infrastructure funding, include the infrastructure funding terms in the MOU, and sign the MOU. The local funding mechanism must meet all of the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The infrastructure costs are funded through cash and fairly evaluated non-cash and third-party in-kind partner contributions and include any funding from philanthropic organizations or other private entities, or through other alternative financing options, to provide a stable and equitable funding stream for ongoing one-stop delivery system operations;</P>
              <P>(2) Contributions must be negotiated between one-stop partners, chief elected officials, and the Local WDB and the amount to be contributed must be included in the MOU;</P>
              <P>(3) The one-stop partner program's proportionate share of funding must be calculated in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR part 200 based upon a reasonable cost allocation methodology whereby infrastructure costs are charged to each partner in proportion to its use of the one-stop center, relative to benefits received. Such costs must also be allowable, reasonable, necessary, and allocable;</P>
              <P>(4) Partner shares must be periodically reviewed and reconciled against actual costs incurred, and adjusted to ensure that actual costs charged to any one-stop partners are proportionate to the use of the one-stop center and relative to the benefit received by the one-stop partners and their respective programs or activities.</P>
              <P>(b) In developing the section of the MOU on one-stop infrastructure funding described in § 361.755, the Local WDB and chief elected officials will:</P>

              <SUBJECT>What funds are used to pay for infrastructure costs in the local one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) In the local funding mechanism, one-stop partner programs may determine what funds they will use to pay for infrastructure costs. The use of these funds must be in accordance with the requirements in this subpart, and with the relevant partner's authorizing statutes and regulations, including, for example, prohibitions against supplanting non-Federal resources, statutory limitations on administrative costs, and all other applicable legal requirements. In the case of partners administering programs authorized by title I of WIOA, these infrastructure costs may be considered program costs. In the case of partners administering adult education and literacy programs authorized by title II of WIOA, these funds must include Federal funds made <PRTPAGE P="384"/>available for the local administration of adult education and literacy programs authorized by title II of WIOA. These funds may also include non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind or third-party contributions. In the case of partners administering the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, funds used to pay for infrastructure costs may include funds available for local administrative expenses, non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind or third-party contributions, and may include other funds made available by the State.</P>
              <P>(b) There are no specific caps on the amount or percent of overall funding a one-stop partner may contribute to fund infrastructure costs under the local funding mechanism, except that contributions for administrative costs may not exceed the amount available for administrative costs under the authorizing statute of the partner program. However, amounts contributed for infrastructure costs must be allowable and based on proportionate use of the one-stop centers and relative benefit received by the partner program, taking into account the total cost of the one-stop infrastructure as well as alternate financing options, and must be consistent with 2 CFR part 200, including the Federal cost principles.</P>
              <P>(c) Cash, non-cash, and third-party in-kind contributions may be provided by one-stop partners to cover their proportionate share of infrastructure costs.</P>
              <P>(1) Cash contributions are cash funds provided to the Local WDB or its designee by one-stop partners, either directly or by an interagency transfer.</P>
              <P>(2) Non-cash contributions are comprised of—</P>
              <P>(i) Expenditures incurred by one-stop partners on behalf of the one-stop center; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Non-cash contributions or goods or services contributed by a partner program and used by the one-stop center.</P>
              <P>(3) Non-cash contributions, especially those set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, must be valued consistent with 2 CFR 200.306 to ensure they are fairly evaluated and meet the partners' proportionate share.</P>
              <P>(4) Third-party in-kind contributions are:</P>
              <P>(i) Contributions of space, equipment, technology, non-personnel services, or other like items to support the infrastructure costs associated with one-stop operations, by a non-one-stop partner to support the one-stop center in general, not a specific partner; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Contributions by a non-one-stop partner of space, equipment, technology, non-personnel services, or other like items to support the infrastructure costs associated with one-stop operations, to a one-stop partner to support its proportionate share of one-stop infrastructure costs.</P>
              <P>(iii) In-kind contributions described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section must be valued consistent with 2 CFR 200.306 and reconciled on a regular basis to ensure they are fairly evaluated and meet the proportionate share of the partner.</P>

              <P>(5) All partner contributions, regardless of the type, must be reconciled on a regular basis (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> monthly or quarterly), comparing actual expenses incurred to relative benefits received, to ensure each partner program is contributing its proportionate share in accordance with the terms of the MOU.</P>

              <P>(c) In certain situations, the Governor does not determine the infrastructure cost contributions for some one-stop partner programs under the State funding mechanism.</P>
              <P>(1) The Governor will not determine the contribution amounts for infrastructure funds for Native American program grantees described in 20 CFR part 684. The appropriate portion of funds to be provided by Native American program grantees to pay for one-stop infrastructure must be determined as part of the development of the MOU described in § 361.500 and specified in that MOU.</P>
              <P>(2) In States in which the policy-making authority is placed in an entity or official that is independent of the authority of the Governor with respect to the funds provided for adult education and literacy activities authorized under title II of WIOA, postsecondary career and technical education activities authorized under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, or VR services authorized under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (other than sec. 112 or part C), as amended by WIOA title IV, the determination of the amount each of the applicable partners must contribute to assist in paying the infrastructure costs of one-stop centers must be made by the official or chief officer of the entity with such authority, in consultation with the Governor.</P>
              <P>(d) Any duty, ability, choice, responsibility, or other action otherwise related to the determination of infrastructure costs contributions that is assigned to the Governor in §§ 361.730 through 361.745 also applies to this decision-making process performed by the official or chief officer described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(5) The Governor must then calculate the statewide caps on the amounts that partner programs may be required to contribute toward infrastructure funding, according to the steps found at § 361.738(a)(1) through (4).</P>
              <P>(6) The Governor must ensure that the aggregate total of the infrastructure contributions according to proportionate share required of all local partner programs in local areas under the State funding mechanism do not exceed the cap for that particular program, in accordance with § 361.738(b)(1). If the total does not exceed the cap, the Governor must direct each one-stop partner program to pay the amount determined under § 361.737(a) toward the infrastructure funding costs of the one-stop center. If the total does exceed the cap, then to determine the amount to direct each one-stop program to pay, the Governor may:</P>
              <P>(i) Ascertain, in accordance with § 361.738(b)(2)(i), whether the local partner or partners whose proportionate shares are calculated above the individual program caps are willing to voluntarily contribute above the capped amount to equal that program's proportionate share; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Choose from the options provided in § 361.738(b)(2)(ii), including having the local area re-enter negotiations to reassess each one-stop partner's proportionate share and make adjustments or identify alternate sources of funding to make up the difference between the capped amount and the proportionate share of infrastructure funding of the one-stop partner.</P>
              <P>(7) If none of the solutions given in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section prove to be viable, the Governor must reassess the proportionate shares of each one-stop partner so that the aggregate amount attributable to the local partners for each program is less than that program's cap amount. Upon such reassessment, the Governor must direct each one-stop partner program to pay the reassessed amount toward the infrastructure funding costs of the one-stop center.</P>

The cap is the amount determined under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, which the Governor derives by:</P>

              <P>(1) First, determining the amount resulting from applying the percentage for the corresponding one-stop partner program provided in paragraph (d) of this section to the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out the one-stop partner program in the State for the applicable fiscal year;<PRTPAGE P="388"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Second, selecting a factor (or factors) that reasonably indicates the use of one-stop centers in the State, applying such factor(s) to all local areas in the State, and determining the percentage of such factor(s) applicable to the local areas that reached agreement under the local funding mechanism in the State;</P>

              <P>(4) Fourth, determining the amount that results from subtracting the amount determined under paragraph (a)(3) of this section from the amount determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The outcome of this final calculation results in the partner program's cap.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The Governor must ensure that the funds required to be contributed by each partner program in the local areas in the State under the State funding mechanism, in aggregate, do not exceed the statewide cap for each program as determined under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the contributions initially determined under § 361.737 would exceed the applicable cap determined under paragraph (a) of this section, the Governor may:</P>
              <P>(i) Ascertain if the one-stop partner whose contribution would otherwise exceed the cap determined under paragraph (a) of this section will voluntarily contribute above the capped amount, so that the total contributions equal that partner's proportionate share. The one-stop partner's contribution must still be consistent with the program's authorizing laws and regulations, the Federal cost principles in 2 CFR part 200, and other applicable legal requirements; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Direct or allow the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners to: Re-enter negotiations, as necessary; reduce the infrastructure costs to reflect the amount of funds that are available for such costs without exceeding the cap levels; reassess the proportionate share of each one-stop partner; or identify alternative sources of financing for one-stop infrastructure funding, consistent with the requirement that each one-stop partner pay an amount that is consistent with the proportionate use of the one-stop center and relative benefit received by the partner, the program's authorizing laws and regulations, the Federal cost principles in 2 CFR part 200, and other applicable legal requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) If applicable under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners, after renegotiation, may come to agreement, sign an MOU, and proceed under the local funding mechanism. Such actions do not require the redetermination of the applicable caps under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the State Supported Employment Services program?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Under the State supported employment services program, the Secretary provides grants to assist States in developing and implementing collaborative programs with appropriate entities to provide programs of supported employment services for individuals with the most significant disabilities, including youth with the most significant disabilities, to enable them to achieve an employment outcome of supported employment in competitive integrated employment. Grants made under the State supported <PRTPAGE P="394"/>employment services program supplement a State's vocational rehabilitation program grants under 34 CFR part 361.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of this part and 34 CFR part 361, “supported employment” means competitive integrated employment, including customized employment, or employment in an integrated work setting in which an individual with a most significant disability, including a youth with a most significant disability, is working on a short-term basis toward competitive integrated employment, that is individualized and customized, consistent with the unique strengths, abilities, interests, and informed choice of the individual, including with ongoing support services for individuals with the most significant disabilities—</P>
              <P>(1)(i) For whom competitive integrated employment has not historically occurred; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For whom competitive integrated employment has been interrupted or intermittent as a result of a significant disability; and</P>
              <P>(2) Who, because of the nature and severity of the disability, need intensive supported employment services, and extended services after the transition from support provided by the designated State unit in order to perform the work.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Short-term basis.</E> For purposes of this part, an individual with a most significant disability, whose supported employment in an integrated setting does not satisfy the criteria of competitive integrated employment, as defined in 34 CFR 361.5(c)(9), is considered to be working on a short-term basis toward competitive integrated employment so long as the individual can reasonably anticipate achieving competitive integrated employment—</P>
              <P>(1) Within six months of achieving a supported employment outcome; or,</P>
              <P>(2) In limited circumstances, within a period not to exceed 12 months from the achievement of the supported employment outcome, if a longer period is necessary based on the needs of the individual, and the individual has demonstrated progress toward competitive earnings based on information contained in the service record.</P>

              <P>(a) The Governor shall redesignate the designated agency for carrying out the CAP to an agency that is independent of any agency that provides treatment, services, or rehabilitation to individuals under the Act if, after August 7, 1998—</P>
              <P>(1) The designated State agency undergoes any change in the organizational structure of the agency that results in one or more new State agencies or departments, or results in the merger with one or more other State agencies or departments, and</P>
              <P>(2) The designated State agency contains an office or unit conducting the CAP.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the designated State agency has the meaning given to that term at 34 CFR 361.5(c)(12) and described at 34 CFR 361.13.</P>
              <P>(b) The Governor may not redesignate the agency designated pursuant to section 112(c) of the Act and § 370.2(b) without good cause and without complying with the requirements of §§ 370.10 through 370.17.</P>
              <P>(c) For purposes of §§ 370.10 through 370.17, a “redesignation of” or “to redesignate” a designated agency means any change in or transfer of the designation of an agency previously designated by the Governor to conduct the State's CAP to a new or different agency, unit, or organization, including—</P>
              <P>(1) A decision by a designated agency to cancel its existing contract with another entity with which it has previously contracted to carry out and operate all or part of its responsibilities under the CAP (including providing advisory, assistance, or advocacy services to eligible clients and client-applicants); or</P>
              <P>(2) A decision by a designated agency not to renew its existing contract with another entity with which it has previously contracted. Therefore, an agency that is carrying out a State's CAP under a contract with a designated agency is considered a designated agency for purposes of §§ 370.10 through 370.17.</P>
              <P>(d) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a designated agency that does not renew a contract for CAP services because it is following State procurement laws that require contracts to be awarded through a competitive bidding process is presumed to have good cause for not renewing an existing contract. However, this presumption may be rebutted.</P>
              <P>(e) If State procurement laws require a designated agency to award a contract through a competitive bidding process, the designated agency must hold public hearings on the request for proposal before awarding the new contract.</P>

              <P>(d) Following public notice, public hearings concerning the proposed redesignation must be conducted in an accessible format that provides individuals with disabilities or their representatives an opportunity for comment. The Governor shall maintain a written public record of these hearings.</P>
              <P>(e) The Governor shall fully consider any public comments before issuing a written decision to redesignate.</P>

              <P>(a) After reserving funds required under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the Secretary shall allot the remainder of the sums appropriated for each fiscal year under this section among the States on the basis of relative population of each State, except that no such entity shall receive less than $50,000.</P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary allocates $30,000 each, unless the provisions of section 112(e)(1)(D) of the Act are applicable, to American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.</P>
              <P>(c) The Secretary shall reserve funds, from the amount appropriated to carry out this part, to make a grant to the protection and advocacy system serving the American Indian Consortium to provide services in accordance with this part. The amount of the grant to the protection and advocacy system serving the American Indian Consortium shall be the same amount as is provided to a territory under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) For any fiscal year for which the amount appropriated equals or exceeds $14,000,000, the Secretary may reserve not less than 1.8 percent and not more than 2.2 percent of such amount to provide a grant for training and technical assistance for the programs established under this part.</P>
              <P>(2) All training and technical assistance shall be coordinated with activities provided under 34 CFR 381.22.</P>
              <P>(3) The Secretary shall make a grant pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section to an entity that has experience in or knowledge related to the provision of services authorized under this part.</P>

              <P>(e)(1) Unless prohibited or otherwise provided by State or tribal law, regulation, or policy, the Secretary pays to the designated agency, from the State allotment under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the amount specified in the State's or the eligible protection and advocacy system's approved request. Because the designated agency, including the protection and advocacy system serving the American Indian Consortium, is the eventual, if not the direct, recipient of the CAP funds, 34 CFR part 81 and 2 CFR part 200 apply to the designated agency, whether or not the designated agency is the actual recipient of the CAP grant.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding the grant made to the protection and advocacy system serving the American Indian Consortium under paragraph (c) of this section, the State remains the grantee for purposes of 34 CFR part 76 and 2 CFR part 200 because it is the State that submits an application for and receives the CAP grant.

Post-employment services are available to assist an individual to maintain employment, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> the individual's employment is jeopardized because of conflicts with supervisors or co-workers, and the individual needs mental health services and counseling to maintain the employment; or the individual requires assistive technology to maintain the employment; to regain employment, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> the individual's job is eliminated through reorganization and new placement services are needed; and to advance in employment, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> the employment is no longer consistent with the individual's unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice.</P>

              <P>(d) The Tribal Vocational Rehabilitation unit must develop and maintain written policies regarding the provision of vocational rehabilitation services that ensure that the provision of services is based on the vocational rehabilitation needs of each individual as identified in that individual's IPE and is consistent with the individual's informed choice. The written policies may not establish any arbitrary limits on the nature and scope of vocational rehabilitation services to be provided to the individual to achieve an employment outcome. The policies must be developed in accordance with the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Off-reservation services.</E> (i) The Tribal Vocational Rehabilitation unit may establish a preference for on- or near-reservation services, provided that the preference does not effectively deny an individual a necessary service.

              <P>(B) permits exceptions so that individual needs can be addressed.</P>
              <P>(C) The Tribal Vocational Rehabilitation unit may not place absolute dollar limits on the amount it will pay for specific service categories or on the total services provided to an individual.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Duration of services</E> (i) The Tribal Vocational Rehabilitation unit may establish reasonable time periods for the provision of services provided that the time periods—</P>
              <P>(A) Are not so short as effectively to deny an individual a necessary service; and</P>
              <P>(B) Permit exceptions so that individual needs can be addressed.</P>

              <P>(ii) The Tribal Vocational Rehabilitation unit may not place time limits on the provision of specific services or on the provision of services to an individual.

              <P>(2) To assist applicants and eligible individuals in exercising informed choice in decisions related to the provision of assessment services;</P>
              <P>(3) To develop and implement flexible procurement policies and methods that facilitate the provision of vocational rehabilitation services, and that afford eligible individuals meaningful choices among the methods used to procure vocational rehabilitation services;</P>

Any vending machine income not necessary for such purposes shall be used by the State licensing agency for the maintenance and replacement of equipment, the purchase of new equipment, management services, and assuring a fair minimum return to vendors. Any assessment charged to blind vendors by a State licensing agency shall be reduced pro rata in an amount equal to the total of such remaining vending machine income.</P>

              <P>(c) The State licensing agency shall further set out the method of determining the charge for each of the above purposes listed in paragraph (b) of this section, which will be determined with the active participation of the State Committee of Blind Vendors and which will be designed to prevent, so far as is practicable, a greater charge for any purpose than is reasonably required for that purpose.

              <P>(a) If the Secretary has reason to believe that, in the administration of the program, there is a failure on the part of any State licensing agency to comply substantially with the Act and this part, he shall so inform such agency in <PRTPAGE P="486"/>writing, setting forth, in detail, the areas in which there is such failure and giving it a reasonable opportunity to comply.</P>
              <P>(b) If, after the lapse of a reasonable time, the Secretary is of the opinion that such failure to comply still continues and that the State licensing agency is not taking the necessary steps to comply, he shall offer to such agency, by reasonable notice in writing thereto and to the chief executive of the State, an opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary (or person designated by the Secretary) to determine whether there is a failure on the part of such agency to comply substantially with the provisions of the Act and of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) If it is thereupon determined that there is a failure on the part of such agency to comply substantially with the Act and this part, appropriate written notice shall be given to such agency and to the chief executive of the State suspending such agency's designation as licensing agency effective 90 days from the date of such notice. A copy of such written notice shall be given to each department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States responsible for the maintenance, operation, and protection of Federal property on which vending machines subject to the requirements of § 395.32 are located in the State.

              <P>(d) If, before the expiration of such 90 days, the Secretary (or person designated by him) determines that the State licensing agency is taking the necessary steps to comply, he may postpone the effective date of such suspension for such time as he deems necessary in the best interest of the program.</P>

              <P>(a) Each department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States in control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of Federal property shall take all steps necessary to assure that, wherever feasible, in light of appropriate space and potential patronage, one or more vending facilities for operation by blind licensees shall be located on all Federal property <E T="03">Provided</E> that the location or operation of such facility or facilities would not adversely affect the interests of the United States.

              <P>(a) Effective January 2, 1975, no department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States shall undertake to acquire by ownership, rent, or lease, or to otherwise occupy, in whole or in part, any building unless it is determined that such building includes a satisfactory site or sites for the location and operation of a vending facility by a blind vendor. In those cases where a purchase contract, an agreement to lease, or other similar commitment was entered into prior to January 2, 1975, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply.</P>

              <P>(b) Effective January 2, 1975, no department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, shall undertake to occupy, in whole or in part, any building which is to be constructed, substantially altered, or renovated, or in the case of a building which is occupied on January 2, 1975 by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, no such department, agency, or instrumentality shall undertake to substantially alter or renovate such building, unless it is determined that the design for such construction, substantial alteration, or renovation includes a satisfactory site or sites for the location and operation of a vending facility by a blind vendor. In those cases where a design contract or other similar commitment was entered into prior to January 2, 1975, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply. For purposes of this paragraph, <E T="03">substantial alteration or renovation of a building</E> means a permanent material change in the floor area of such building which would render such building appropriate for the location and operation of a vending facility by a blind vendor.</P>

              <P>(c) The determination that a building contains a satisfactory site or sites under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be made after consultation between the State licensing agency and the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States which is planning to acquire or otherwise occupy such building. In order to make such determination, effective on the publication date of this part each such department, agency, or instrumentality shall provide to the appropriate State licensing agency written notice of its intention to acquire or otherwise occupy such building. Such written notice shall be by certified or registered mail with return receipt and shall be provided as early as practicable but no later than 60 days prior to such intended action. The written notice shall indicate that a satisfactory site or sites for the location and operation of a vending facility by blind persons is included in the plans for the building to be acquired or otherwise occupied and shall further assure that the State licensing agency shall be afforded the opportunity to determine whether such building includes a satisfactory site or sites for a vending facility. The written notice shall further assure that the State licensing agency, subject to the approval of the head of the Federal property managing department, agency, or instrumentality, shall be offered the opportunity to select the location and type of vending facility to be operated by a blind vendor prior to the completion of the final space layout of the building. The receipt of such written notice shall be acknowledged in writing promptly by the State licensing agency but no later than within 30 days and the State licensing agency shall indicate at that time whether <PRTPAGE P="488"/>it is interested in establishing a vending facility. A copy of the written notice to the State licensing agency and the State licensing agency's acknowledgement shall be provided to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(d) When, after a written notice has been provided under paragraph (c) of this section, the State licensing agency determines that the number of persons using the Federal property is or will be insufficient to support a vending facility, and the Secretary concurs with such determination, the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply. The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall also not apply when fewer than 100 Federal Government employees are or will be located during normal working hours in the building to be acquired or otherwise occupied or when such building contains less than 15,000 square feet of interior space to be utilized for Federal Government purposes in the case of buildings in which services are to be provided to the public.</P>

              <P>(e) The operation of a vending facility established under pre-existing arrangements shall not be affected by the provisions of this section. The provisions of this section shall further not preclude future arrangements under which vending facilities to be operated by blind vendors may be established in buildings of a size or with an employee population less than that specified in paragraph (d) of this section: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That both the State licensing agency and the Federal property managing department, agency or instrumentality concur in such establishment.</P>
              <P>(f) Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United States, when leasing property in privately owned buildings, shall make every effort to lease property capable of accommodating a vending facility. When, however, such department, agency, or instrumentality is leasing part of a privately owned building in which prior to the execution of the lease, the lessor or any of his tenants had in operation or had entered into a contract for the operation of a restaurant or other food facility in a part of the building not included in such lease and the operation of a vending facility by a blind vendor would be in proximate and substantial direct competition with such restaurant or other food facility, the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall not apply.</P>

              <P>(e) The determination that a vending machine on Federal property is in direct competition with a vending facility operated by a blind vendor shall be the responsibility of the on-site official responsible for the Federal property of each property managing department, agency or instrumentality of the United States, subject to the concurrence of the State licensing agency.</P>
              <P>(f) In the case of vending machine income which, prior to the effective date of this part, has been disbursed to a blind vendor by a property managing department, agency, or instrumentality from proceeds which accrued from operations subsequent to January 2, 1975, pursuant to agreements in effect prior to such time, such income may be deducted, at the discretion of such property managing department, agency or instrumentality, from vending machine income due to the State licensing agency under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) In order to establish the ability of blind vendors to operate a cafeteria in such a manner as to provide food service at comparable cost and of comparable high quality as that available from other providers of cafeteria services, the appropriate State licensing agency shall be invited to respond to solicitations for offers when a cafeteria contract is contemplated by the appropriate property managing department, agency, or instrumentality. Such solicitations for offers shall establish criteria under which all responses will be judged. Such criteria may include sanitation practices, personnel, staffing, menu pricing and portion sizes, menu variety, budget and accounting practices. If the proposal received from the State licensing agency is judged to be within a competitive range and has been ranked among those proposals which have a reasonable chance of being selected for final award, the property managing department, agency, or instrumentality shall consult with the Secretary as required under paragraph (a) of this section.
