      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), the Department maintains a public reading room containing agency records that the FOIA requires to be made regularly available for public inspection and copying. Published records of the Department, whether or not available for purchase, are made available for examination. The Department's public reading room is located at the National Library of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Plaza Level (Level B), Washington, DC 20202-0008. The hours of operation are 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday (except Federal holidays).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reading room records.</E> Agency records maintained in the public reading room include final opinions and orders in adjudications, statements of policy and interpretations adopted by the Department and not published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> administrative staff manuals and instructions affecting the public, and copies of all agency records regardless of form or format released to the public pursuant to a FOIA request that the Department determines are likely to be the subject of future FOIA requests.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Electronic access.</E> The Department makes reading room records created on <PRTPAGE P="8"/>or after November 1, 1996, available through its electronic reading room, located on the Department's FOIA Web site at <E T="03">http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/foia/readingroom.html.</E>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Department discloses business information it obtains from a submitter under the Act in accordance with this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Business information</E> means commercial or financial information obtained by the Department from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) (Exemption 4 of the Act).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity (including corporations; State, local, and tribal governments; and foreign governments) from whom the Department obtains business information.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation of business information.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) A submitter must use good faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that it considers to be business information protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(2) A submitter's designations are not binding on the Department and will expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</P>
            <P>(3) A blanket designation on each page of a submission that all information contained on the page is protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 presumptively will not be considered a good faith effort.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the Department promptly notifies a submitter whenever a FOIA request or administrative appeal is made under the Act seeking disclosure of the information the submitter has designated in good faith as business information protected from disclosure under paragraph (c) of this section, or the Department otherwise has reason to believe that it may be required to disclose information sought to be designated by the submitter as business information protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the Act. This notice includes either a description of the business information requested or copies of the requested agency records or portions of agency records containing the requested business information as well as a time period, consistent with § 5.21(c), within which the submitter can object to the disclosure pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) If a submitter objects to disclosure, it must submit to the Department a detailed written statement specifying all grounds under Exemption 4 of the Act for denying access to the information, or a portion of the information sought.</P>
            <P>(2) A submitter's failure to object to the disclosure by the deadline established by the Department in the notice provided under paragraph (d) of this section constitutes a waiver of the submitter's right to object to disclosure under paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) A submitter's response to a notice from the Department under paragraph (d) of this section may itself be subject to disclosure under the Act.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> The Department considers a submitter's objections and submissions made in support thereof in deciding whether to disclose business information sought to be protected by the submitter. Whenever the Department decides to disclose information over a submitter's objection, the Department gives the submitter written notice, which includes:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement of the reasons why the submitter's objections to disclosure were not sustained.</P>
            <P>(2) A description of the information to be disclosed.</P>
            <P>(3) A specified disclosure date that is a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Exceptions to notice requirements.</E> The notice requirements of paragraph (d) of this section do not apply if—</P>
            <P>(1) The Department does not disclose the business information of the submitter;</P>

            <P>(2) The Department has previously lawfully published the information;<PRTPAGE P="9"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) The information has been made available to the public by the requester or by third parties;</P>
            <P>(4) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the Act) or regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 (52 FR 23781, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 235); or</P>
            <P>(5) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such case, the Department must provide the submitter with written notice of any final administrative disclosure determination in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of a submitter's business information, the Department promptly notifies the submitter.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Corresponding notice to requester.</E> The Department notifies the requester whenever it notifies a submitter of its opportunity to object to disclosure, of the Department's intent to disclose requested information designated as business information by the submitter, or of the filing of a lawsuit.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Notice of reverse FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of the submitter's information, the Department promptly notifies the requester, and advises the requester that its request will be held in abeyance until the lawsuit initiated by the submitter is resolved.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements for making FOIA requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Making a FOIA request.</E> Any FOIA request for an agency record must be in writing (via paper, facsimile, or electronic mail) and transmitted to the Department as indicated on the Department's Web site. <E T="03">See http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/foia/request_foia.html.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Description of agency records sought.</E> A FOIA request must reasonably describe the agency record sought, to enable Department personnel to locate the agency record or records with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, a FOIA request should describe the type of agency record requested, the subject matter of the agency record, the date, if known, or general time period when it was created, and the person or office that created it. Requesters who have detailed information that would assist in identifying and locating the agency records sought are urged to provide this information to the Department to expedite the handling of a FOIA request.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">FOIA request deemed insufficient.</E> If the Department determines that a FOIA request does not reasonably describe the agency record or records sought, the FOIA request will be deemed insufficient under the Act. In that case, the Department informs the requester of the reason the FOIA request is insufficient and, at the Department's option, either administratively closes the FOIA request as insufficient without determining whether to grant the FOIA request or provides the requester an opportunity to modify the <PRTPAGE P="10"/>FOIA request to meet the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Verification of identity.</E> In compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, FOIA requests for agency records pertaining to the requester, a minor, or an individual who is legally incompetent must include verification of the requester's identity pursuant to 34 CFR 5b.5.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 5.21</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Procedures for processing FOIA requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgements of FOIA requests.</E> The Department promptly notifies the requester when it receives a FOIA request.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Consultation and referrals.</E> When the Department receives a FOIA request for a record or records created by or otherwise received from another agency of the Federal Government, it either responds to the FOIA request after consultation with the other agency, or refers the FOIA request to the other agency for processing. When the Department refers a FOIA request to another agency for processing, the Department will so notify the requester.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Decisions on FOIA requests.</E> The Department determines whether to comply with a FOIA request within 20 working days after the appropriate component of the Department first receives the request. This time period commences on the date that the request is received by the appropriate component of the Department, but commences no later than 10 calendar days after the request is received by the component of the Department designated pursuant to § 5.20(a) to receive FOIA requests for agency records. The Department's failure to comply with these time limits constitutes exhaustion of the requester's administrative remedies for the purposes of judicial action to compel disclosure.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Requests for additional information.</E> The Department may make one request for additional information from the requester and toll the 20-day period while awaiting receipt of the additional information.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Extension of time period for processing a FOIA request.</E> The Department may extend the time period for processing a FOIA request only in unusual circumstances, as described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section, in which case the Department notifies the requester of the extension in writing. A notice of extension affords the requester the opportunity either to modify its FOIA request so that it may be processed within the 20-day time limit, or to arrange with the Department an alternative time period within which the FOIA request will be processed. For the purposes of this section, unusual circumstances include:</P>
            <P>(1) The need to search for and collect the requested agency records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request.</P>
            <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and review and process voluminous agency records responsive to the FOIA request.</P>
            <P>(3) The need to consult with another agency or two or more agency components having a substantial interest in the determination on the FOIA request.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">FOIA Public Liaison and FOIA Requester Service Center.</E> The Department's FOIA Public Liaison assists in the resolution of disputes between the requester and the Department. The Department provides information about the status of a FOIA request to the requester through the Department's FOIA Requester Service Center. Contact information for the Department's FOIA Public Liaison and FOIA Requester Service Center may be found at <E T="03">http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/foia/contacts.html.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Notification of determination.</E> Once the Department makes a determination to grant a FOIA request in whole or in part, it notifies the requester in writing of its decision.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Denials of FOIA requests.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Only Departmental officers or employees delegated the authority to deny a FOIA request may deny a FOIA request on behalf of the Department.</P>

            <P>(2)(i) The Department notifies the requester in writing of any decision to deny a FOIA request in whole or in part. Denials under this paragraph can include the following: A determination to deny access in whole or in part to <PRTPAGE P="11"/>any agency record responsive to a request; a determination that a requested agency record does not exist or cannot be located in the Department's records; a determination that a requested agency record is not readily retrievable or reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; a determination on any disputed fee matter, including a denial of a request for a fee waiver; and a denial of a request for expedited processing.</P>
            <P>(ii) All determinations denying a FOIA request in whole or in part are signed by an officer or employee designated under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, and include:</P>
            <P>(A) The name and title or position of the denying officer or employee.</P>
            <P>(B) A brief statement of the reason or reasons for the denial, including any exemptions applicable under the Act.</P>
            <P>(C) An estimate of the volume of agency records or information denied, by number of pages or other reasonable estimate (except where the volume of agency records or information denied is apparent from deletions made on agency records disclosed in part, or providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption under the Act).</P>
            <P>(D) Where an agency record has been disclosed only in part, an indication of the exemption under the Act justifying the redaction in the agency record (unless providing this information would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption under the Act).</P>
            <P>(E) A statement of appeal rights and a list of requirements for filing an appeal under § 5.40.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Timing of responses to FOIA requests.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Multitrack processing.</E>
            </P>
            <P>The Department may use two or more processing tracks to distinguish between simple and more complex FOIA requests based on one or more of the following: the time and work necessary to process the FOIA request, the volume of agency records responsive to the FOIA request, and whether the FOIA request qualifies for expedited processing as described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The Department gives expedited treatment to FOIA requests and appeals whenever the Department determines that a FOIA request involves one or more of the following:</P>
            <P>(A) A circumstance in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.</P>
            <P>(B) The urgent need of a person primarily engaged in disseminating information to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity; or</P>
            <P>(C) Other circumstances that the Department determines demonstrate a compelling need for expedited processing.</P>
            <P>(ii) A requester may ask for expedited processing at the time of the initial FOIA request or at any time thereafter.</P>
            <P>(iii) A request for expedited processing must contain a detailed explanation of the basis for the request, and must be accompanied by a statement certifying the truth of the circumstances alleged or other evidence of the requester's compelling need acceptable to the Department.</P>
            <P>(iv) The Department makes a determination whether to grant or deny a request for expedited processing within 10 calendar days of its receipt by the component of the Department designated pursuant to § 5.20(a) to receive FOIA requests for agency records, and processes FOIA requests accepted for expedited processing as soon as practicable and on a priority basis.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fees generally.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The Department assesses fees for processing FOIA requests in accordance with § 5.32(a), except where fees are limited under § 5.32(b) or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under § 5.33. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the U.S. Department of Education, and must include the FOIA request number on the check or money order. <PRTPAGE P="12"/>The Department retains full discretion to limit or adjust fees.</P>
            <SECAUTH>(Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A), 20 U.S.C. 3474)</SECAUTH>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 5.31</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Fee definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> means a request from or on behalf of a FOIA requester seeking information for a use or purpose that furthers the requester's commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. For the purpose of assessing fees under the Act, the Department determines, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested agency records.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> mean those expenses that an agency actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use FOIA requests, reviewing) agency records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the pro rata salary of the employee(s) performing the work (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> basic rate of pay plus 16 percent) and the cost of operating duplication machinery. The Department's other overhead expenses are not included in direct costs.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Duplication</E> means making a copy of the agency record, or of the information in it, as necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can be made in several forms and formats, including paper and electronic records. The Department honors a requester's specified preference as to form or format of disclosure, provided that the agency record is readily reproducible with reasonable effort in the requested form or format.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education, that operates a program of scholarly research. To qualify as an educational institution under this part, a requester must demonstrate that an educational institution authorized the request and that the agency records are not sought for individual or commercial use, but are instead sought to further scholarly research. A request for agency records for the purpose of affecting a requester's application for, or prospect of obtaining, new or additional grants, contracts, or similar funding is presumptively a commercial use request.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A noncommercial scientific institution does not operate for a “commercial use”, as the term is defined in paragraph (a) of this section. To qualify as a noncommercial scientific institution under this part, a requester must demonstrate that a noncommercial scientific institution authorized the request and that the agency records are sought to further scientific research and not for a commercial use. A request for agency records for the purpose of affecting a requester's application for, or prospect of obtaining, new or additional grants, contracts, or similar funding is presumptively a commercial use request.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Representative of the news media,</E> or <E T="03">news media requester,</E> means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. For the purposes of this section, the term “news” means information about current events or information that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that qualify as disseminators of news and make their products available for purchase by, subscription by, or free distribution to the general public. To be regarded as a representative of the news media, a “freelance” journalist must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication, such as a publication contract or a past publication record. For inclusion in this category, a requester must not be seeking the requested agency records for a commercial use.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Review</E> means the examination of an agency record located in response to a FOIA request to determine whether <PRTPAGE P="13"/>any portion of the record is exempt from disclosure under the Act. Reviewing the record includes processing the agency record for disclosure and making redactions and other preparations for disclosure. Review costs are recoverable even if an agency record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time includes time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure but does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions under the Act.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Search</E> means the process of looking for and retrieving agency records or information responsive to a FOIA request. Searching includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within agency records and reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from agency records maintained in electronic form or format, provided that such efforts do not significantly interfere with the operation of the Department's automated information systems.</P>
            <SECAUTH>(Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A), 20 U.S.C. 3474)</SECAUTH>

            <SECTNO>§ 5.32</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Assessment of fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Fees.</E> In responding to FOIA requests, the Department charges the following fees (in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget's “Uniform FOIA Fee Schedule and Guidelines,” 52 FR 10012 (March 27, 1987)), unless it has granted a waiver or reduction of fees under § 5.33 and subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (b) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Search.</E> The Department charges search fees, subject to the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section. Search time includes time spent searching, regardless of whether the search results in the location of responsive agency records and, if so, whether such agency records are released to the requester under the Act. The requester will be charged the direct costs, as defined in § 5.31(b), of the search. In the case of computer searches for agency records, the Department charges the requester for the direct cost of conducting the search, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Review.</E> (i) The Department charges fees for initial agency record review at the same rate as for searches, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) No fees are charged for review at the administrative appeal level except in connection with—</P>
            <P>(A) The review of agency records other than agency records identified as responsive to the FOIA request in the initial decision; and</P>
            <P>(B) The Department's decision regarding whether to assert that an exemption exists under the Act that was not cited in the decision on the initial FOIA request.</P>
            <P>(iii) Review fees are not assessed for FOIA requests other than those made for a “commercial use,” as the term is defined in § 5.31(a).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> The Department charges duplication fees at the rate of $0.20 per page for paper photocopies of agency records, $3.00 per CD for documents recorded on CD, and at the direct cost for duplication for electronic copies and other forms of duplication, subject to the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitations on fees.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Fees are limited to charges for document duplication when agency records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by—</P>
            <P>(i) An educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A representative of the news media.</P>
            <P>(2) For FOIA requests other than commercial use FOIA requests, the Department provides the first 100 pages of agency records released (or the cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search (or the cost equivalent) without charge, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(iv)(II).</P>
            <P>(3) Whenever the Department calculates that the fees assessable for a FOIA request under paragraph (a) of this section total $25.00 or less, the Department processes the FOIA request without charge to the requester.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.</E> When the Department estimates or determines that the fees for processing a FOIA request will total more than $25 and the requester has not stated a willingness to pay such fees, the Department notifies the requester of <PRTPAGE P="14"/>the anticipated amount of fees before processing the FOIA request. If the Department can readily anticipate fees for processing only a portion of a request, the Department advises the requester that the anticipated fee is for processing only a portion of the request. When the Department has notified a requester of anticipated fees greater than $25, the Department does not further process the request until the requester agrees in writing to pay the anticipated total fee.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Charges for other services.</E> When the Department chooses as a matter of administrative discretion to provide a special service, such as certification of agency records, it charges the requester the direct cost of providing the service.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> The Department charges interest on any unpaid bill assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717. In charging interest, the Department follows the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended (Pub. L. 97-365), and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Aggregating FOIA requests.</E> When the Department reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting together, is attempting to divide a FOIA request into a series of FOIA requests for the purpose of avoiding or reducing otherwise applicable fees, the Department may aggregate such FOIA requests for the purpose of assessing fees. The Department does not aggregate multiple FOIA requests involving unrelated matters.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) For FOIA requests other than those described in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section, the Department does not require the requester to pay fees in advance.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the Department estimates or determines that fees for processing a FOIA request will total more than $250, it may require the requester to pay the fees in advance, except where the Department receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees.</P>
            <P>(3) The Department may require a requester who has previously failed to pay a properly assessed FOIA fee within 30 calendar days of the billing date to pay in advance the full amount of estimated or actual fees before it further processes a new or pending FOIA request from that requester.</P>
            <P>(4) When the Department requires advance payment of estimated or assessed fees, it does not consider the FOIA request received and does not further process the FOIA request until payment is received.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Tolling.</E> When necessary for the Department to clarify issues regarding fee assessment with the FOIA requester, the time limit for responding to the FOIA request is tolled until the Department resolves such issues with the requester.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Other statutory requirements.</E> The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for producing particular types of agency records.</P>
            <SECAUTH>(Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A), 20 U.S.C. 3474)</SECAUTH>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Department processes a FOIA request for agency records without charge or at a charge less than that established under § 5.32(a) when the Department determines that—</P>
            <P>(1) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government; and</P>
            <P>(2) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(b) To determine whether a FOIA request is eligible for waiver or reduction of fees pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Department considers the following factors:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether the subject of the request specifically concerns identifiable operations or activities of the government.</P>
            <P>(2) Whether the disclosable portions of the requested information will be meaningfully informative in relation to the subject matter of the request.</P>

            <P>(3) The disclosure's contribution to public understanding of government operations, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the understanding of <PRTPAGE P="15"/>the public at large, as opposed to an individual or a narrow segment of interested persons (including whether the requester has expertise in the subject area of the FOIA request as well as the intention and demonstrated ability to disseminate the information to the public).</P>

            <P>(4) The significance of the disclosure's contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the public's understanding of the subject matter existing prior to the disclosure must be likely to be enhanced significantly by the disclosure.</P>
            <P>(c) To determine whether a FOIA request is eligible for waiver or reduction of fees pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Department considers the following factors:</P>

            <P>(1) The existence of the requester's commercial interest, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure.</P>
            <P>(2) If a commercial interest is identified, whether the commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(d) When the fee waiver requirements are met only with respect to a portion of a FOIA request, the Department waives or reduces fees only for that portion of the request.</P>
            <P>(e) A requester seeking a waiver or reduction of fees must submit evidence demonstrating that the FOIA request meets all the criteria listed in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) A requester must seek a fee waiver for each FOIA request for which a waiver is sought. The Department does not grant standing fee waivers but considers each fee waiver request independently on its merits.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Appeals of adverse determinations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> A requester may seek an administrative review of an adverse determination on the FOIA request made by the requester by submitting an appeal of the determination to the Department. Adverse determinations include denials of access to agency records, in whole or in part; “no agency records” responses; and adverse fee decisions, including denials of requests for fee waivers, and all aspects of fee assessments.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Appeal requirements.</E> A requester must submit an appeal within 35 calendar days of the date on the adverse determination letter issued by the Department or, where the requester has received no determination, at any time after the due date for such determination. An appeal must be in writing and must include a detailed statement of all legal and factual bases for the appeal. The requester's failure to comply with time limits set forth in this section constitutes exhaustion of the requester's administrative remedies for the purposes of initiating judicial action to compel disclosure.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination on appeal.</E> (1) The Department makes a written determination on an administrative appeal within 20 working days after receiving the appeal. The time limit may be extended in accordance with § 5.21(c) through (e). The Department's failure to comply with time limits set forth in this section constitutes exhaustion of the requester's administrative remedies for the purposes of initiating judicial action to compel disclosure.</P>
            <P>(2) The Department's determination on an appeal constitutes the Department's final action on the FOIA request. Any Department determination denying an appeal in whole or in part includes the reasons for the denial, including any exemptions asserted under the Act, and notice of the requester's right to seek judicial review of the determination in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). Where the Department makes a determination to grant an appeal in whole or in part, it processes the FOIA request subject to the appeal in accordance with the determination on appeal.</P>

          <P>(b) All components of the Department are governed by the provisions of this part. Also governed by the provisions of this part are advisory committees and councils within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act which provide advice to (1) any official or component of the Department or (2) the President and for which the Department has been delegated responsibility for providing services.</P>

          <P>(d) This part does not:</P>
          <P>(1) Make available to a subject individual records which are not retrieved by that individual's name or other personal identifier.</P>
          <P>(2) Make available to the general public records which are retrieved by a subject individual's name or other personal identifier or make available to the general public records which would otherwise not be available to the general public under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and part 5 of this title.</P>
          <P>(3) Govern the maintenance or disclosure of, notification of or access to, records in the possession of the Department which are subject to regulations of another agency, such as personnel records subject to the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management.</P>
          <P>(4) Apply to grantees, including State and local governments or subdivisions thereof, administering federally funded programs.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
          <P>It is the policy of the Department to protect the privacy of individuals to the fullest extent possible while nonetheless permitting the exchange of records required to fulfill the administrative and program responsibilities of the Department, and responsibilities of the Department for disclosing records which the general public is entitled to have under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and part 5 of this title.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 5b.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Maintenance of records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) No record will be maintained by the Department unless:</P>
          <P>(1) It is relevant and necessary to accomplish a Department function required to be accomplished by statute or Executive Order;</P>

          <P>(2) It is acquired to the greatest extent practicable from the subject individual when maintenance of the record may result in a determination about the subject individual's rights, benefits or privileges under Federal programs;<PRTPAGE P="18"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) The individual providing the record is informed of the authority for providing the record (including whether the providing of the record is mandatory or voluntary, the principal purpose for maintaining the record, the routine uses for the record, what effect his refusal to provide the record may have on him), and if the record is not required by statute or Executive Order to be provided by the individual, he agrees to provide the record.</P>
          <P>(b) No record will be maintained by the Department which describes how an individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized (1) by statute, or (2) by the subject individual, or (3) unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 5b.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Notification of or access to records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Times, places, and manner of requesting notification of or access to a record.</E> (1) Any individual may request notification of a record. He may at the same time request access to any record pertaining to him. An individual may be accompanied by another individual of his choice when he requests access to a record in person; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That he affirmatively authorizes the presence of such other individual during any discussion of a record to which access is requested.</P>
          <P>(2) An individual making a request for notification of or access to a record shall address his request to the responsible Department official and shall verify his identity when required in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. At the time the request is made, the individual shall specify which systems of records he wishes to have searched and the records to which he wishes to have access. He may also request that copies be made of all or any such records. An individual shall also provide the responsible Department official with sufficient particulars to enable such official to distinguish between records on subject individuals with the same name. The necessary particulars are set forth in the notices of systems of records.</P>

          <P>(3) An individual who makes a request in person may leave with any responsible Department official a request for notification of or access to a record under the control of another responsible Department official; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the request is addressed in writing to the appropriate responsible Department official.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Verification of identity</E>—(1) <E T="03">When required.</E> Unless an individual, who is making a request for notification of or access to a record in person, is personally known to the responsible Department official, he shall be required to verify his identity in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section if:</P>
          <P>(i) He makes a request for notification of a record and the responsible Department official determines that the mere disclosure of the existence of the record would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy if disclosed to someone other than the subject individual; or,</P>
          <P>(ii) He makes a request for access to a record which is not required to be disclosed to the general public under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and part 5 of this title.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Manner of verifying identity.</E> (i) An individual who makes a request in person shall provide to the responsible Department official at least one piece of tangible identification such as a driver's license, passport, alien or voter registration card, or union card to verify his identity. If an individual does not have identification papers to verify his identity, he shall certify in writing that he is the individual who he claims to be and that he understands that the knowing and willful request for or acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Act subject to a $5,000 fine.</P>

          <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, an individual who does not make a request in person shall submit a notarized request to the responsible Department official to verify his identity or shall certify in his request that he is the individual who he claims to be and that he understands that the knowing and willful request for or acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Act subject to a $5,000 fine.<PRTPAGE P="19"/>
          </P>

          <P>(iii) An individual who makes a request on behalf of a minor or legal incompetent as authorized under § 5b.10 of this part shall verify his relationship to the minor or legal incompetent, in addition to verifying his own identity, by providing a copy of the minor's birth certificate, a court order, or other competent evidence of guardianship to the responsible Department official; <E T="03">except that,</E> an individual is not required to verify his relationship to the minor or legal incompetent when he is not required to verify his own identity or when evidence of his relationship to the minor or legal incompetent has been previously given to the responsible Department official.</P>
          <P>(iv) An individual shall further verify his identity if he is requesting notification of or access to sensitive records. Any further verification shall parallel the record to which notification or access is being sought. Such further verification may include such particulars as the individual's years of attendance at a particular educational institution, rank attained in the uniformed services, date or place of birth, names of parents, or an occupation.</P>
          <P>(v) An individual who makes a request by telephone shall verify his identity by providing to the responsible Department official identifying particulars which parallel the record to which notification or access is being sought. If the responsible Department official determines that the particulars provided by telephone are insufficient, the requester will be required to submit the request in writing or in person. Telephone requests will not be accepted where an individual is requesting notification of or access to sensitive records.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Granting notification of or access to a record.</E> (1) Subject to the provisions governing exempt systems in § 5b.11 of this part, a responsible Department official, who receives a request for notification of or access to a record and, if required, verification of an individual's identity, will review the request and grant notification or access to a record, if the individual requesting access to the record is the subject individual.</P>
          <P>(2) If the responsible Department official determines that there will be a delay in responding to a request because of the number of requests being processed, a breakdown of equipment, shortage of personnel, storage of records in other locations, etc., he will so inform the individual and indicate when notification or access will be granted.</P>
          <P>(3) Prior to granting notification of or access to a record, the responsible Department official may at his discretion require an individual making a request in person to reduce his request to writing if the individual has not already done so at the time the request is made.</P>

          <P>(a) Any subject individual may request that his record be corrected or amended if he believes that the record is not accurate, timely, complete, or relevant or necessary to accomplish a Department function. A subject individual making a request to amend or correct his record shall address his request to the responsible Department official in writing; <E T="03">except that,</E> the request need not be in writing if the subject individual makes his request in person and the responsible Department official corrects or amends the record at that time.

          <P>(1) The system of records from which the record is retrieved;</P>
          <P>(2) The particular record which he is seeking to correct or amend;</P>

          <P>(b) A request for correction or amendment of a record will be acknowledged within 10 working days of its receipt unless the request can be processed and the subject individual informed of the responsible Department official's decision on the request within that 10 day period.</P>

          <P>(c) If the responsible Department official agrees that the record is not accurate, timely, or complete based on a preponderance of the evidence, the record will be corrected or amended. The record will be deleted without regard to its accuracy, if the record is <PRTPAGE P="20"/>not relevant or necessary to accomplish the Department function for which the record was provided or is maintained. In either case, the subject individual will be informed in writing of the correction, amendment, or deletion and, if accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.</P>
          <P>(d) If the responsible Department official does not agree that the record should be corrected or amended, the subject individual will be informed in writing of the refusal to correct or amend the record. He will also be informed that he may appeal the refusal to correct or amend his record § 5b.8 of this part.</P>

          <P>(2) An appeal will be completed within 30 working days from its receipt by the appeal authority; <E T="03">except that,</E> the appeal authority may for good cause extend this period for an additional 30 days. Should the appeal period be extended, the subject individual appealing the refusal to correct or amend the record will be informed in writing of the extension and the circumstances of the delay. The subject individual's request to amend or correct the record, the responsible Department official's refusal to correct or amend, and any other pertinent material relating to the appeal will be reviewed. No hearing will be held.</P>
          <P>(3) If the appeal authority agrees that the record subject to the appeal should be corrected or amended, the record will be amended and the subject individual will be informed in writing of the correction or amendment. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.</P>
          <P>(4) If the appeal is denied, the subject individual will be informed in writing:</P>
          <P>(i) Of the denial and the reasons for the denial;</P>
          <P>(ii) That he has a right to seek judicial review of the denial; and,</P>
          <P>(iii) That he may submit to the responsible Department official a concise statement of disagreement to be associated with the disputed record and disclosed whenever the record is disclosed.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Notation and disclosure of disputed records.</E> Whenever a subject individual submits a statement of disagreement to the responsible Department official in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, the record will be noted to indicate that it is disputed. In any subsequent disclosure, a copy of the subject individual's statement of disagreement, will be disclosed with the record. If the responsible Department official deems it appropriate, a concise statement of the appeal authority's reasons for denying the subject individual's appeal may also be disclosed with the record. While the subject individual will have access to this statement of reasons, such statement will not be subject to correction or amendment. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be provided a copy of the subject individual's statement of disagreement, as well as the statement, if any, of the appeal authority's reasons for denying the subject individual's appeal.</P>

          <P>(f) <E T="03">Notification of or access to records in exempt systems of records.</E> (1) If a system of records is exempt under this section, an individual may nonetheless request notification of or access to a record in that system.

          <P>(2) An individual will be granted notification of or access to a record in an exempt system but only to the extent that notification or access would not reveal the identity of a source who furnished the record to the Department under an express promise, and, prior to September 27, 1975, an implied promise, that his identity would be held in confidence if—</P>
          <P>(i) The record is in a system of records or that portion of a system of records that is exempt under subsection (k)(2), but not under subsection (j)(2), of the Act and the individual has been, as a result of the maintenance of the record, denied a right, privilege, or benefit to which he or she would otherwise be eligible; or</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> All employees are required to be aware of their responsibilities under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. Regulations implementing the Act are set forth in 34 CFR 5b. Instruction on the requirements of the Act and regulation shall be provided to all new employees of the Department. In addition, supervisors shall be responsible for assuring that employees who are working with systems of records or who undertake new duties which require the use of systems of records are informed of their responsibilities. Supervisors shall also be responsible for assuring that all employees who work with such systems of records are periodically reminded of the requirements of the Act and are advised of any new provisions or interpretations of the Act.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Penalties.</E> (1) All employees must guard against improper disclosure of records which are governed by the Act. Because of the serious consequences of improper invasions of personal privacy, employees may be subject to disciplinary action and criminal prosecution for knowing and willful violations of the Act and regulation. In addition, employees may also be subject to disciplinary action for unknowing or unwillful violations, where the employee had notice of the provisions of the Act and regulations and failed to inform himself sufficiently or to conduct himself in accordance with the requirements to avoid violations.</P>
          <P>(2) The Department may be subjected to civil liability for the following actions undertaken by its employees:</P>

          <P>(a) Making a determination under the Act and §§ 5b.7 and 5b.8 of the regulation not to amend an individual's record in accordance with his request, or failing to make such review in conformity with those provisions;<PRTPAGE P="25"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) Refusing to comply with an individual's request for notification of or access to a record pertaining to him;</P>
          <P>(c) Failing to maintain any record pertaining to any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is necessary to assure fairness in any determination relating to the qualifications, character, rights, or opportunities of, or benefits to the individual that may be made on the basis of such a record, and consequently a determination is made which is adverse to the individual; or</P>
          <P>(d) Failing to comply with any other provision of the Act or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual.</P>
          <P>(3) “An employee may be personally subject to criminal liability as set forth below and in 5 U.S.C. 552a (i):</P>

          <P>(b) “Any officer or employee of any agency who willfully maintains a system of records without meeting the notice requirements [of the Act] shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.”</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Rules Governing Employees Not Working With Systems of Records.</E> Employees whose duties do not involve working with systems of records will not generally disclose to any one, without specific authorization from their supervisors, records pertaining to employees or other individuals which by reason of their official duties are available to them. Notwithstanding the above, the following records concerning Federal employees are a matter of public record and no further authorization is necessary for disclosure:</P>

          </P>
          <FP>In addition, employees shall disclose records which are listed in the Department's Freedom of Information Regulation as being available to the public. Requests for other records will be referred to the responsible Department official. This does not preclude employees from discussing matters which are known to them personally, and without resort to a record, to official investigators of Federal agencies for official purposes such as suitability checks, Equal Employment Opportunity investigations, adverse action proceedings, grievance proceedings, etc.</FP>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Rules governing employees whose duties require use or reference to systems of records.</E> Employees whose official duties require that they refer to, maintain, service, or otherwise deal with systems of records (hereinafter referred to as “Systems Employees”) are governed by the general provisions.

          <P>(b) Permit unauthorized individuals to be present in controlled areas. Any unauthorized individuals observed in controlled areas shall be reported to a supervisor or to the guard force.</P>
          <P>(c) Knowingly or willfully take action which might subject the Department to civil liability.</P>
          <P>(d) Make any arrangements for the design development, or operation of any system of records without making reasonable effort to provide that the system can be maintained in accordance with the Act and regulation.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Contracting officers.</E> In addition to any applicable provisions set forth above, those employees whose official duties involve entering into contracts on behalf of the Department shall also be governed by the following provisions:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Contracts for design, or development of systems and equipment.</E> No contract for the design or development of a system of records, or for equipment to store, service or maintain a system of records shall be entered into unless the contracting officer has made reasonable effort to ensure that the product to be purchased is capable of being used without violation of the Act or regulation. Special attention shall be given to provision of physical safeguards.<PRTPAGE P="26"/>
          </P>

If a determination is made that the operation of the system is to accomplish a Department function, the contracting officer shall be responsible for including in the contract appropriate provisions to apply the provisions of the Act and regulation to the system, including prohibitions against improper release by the contractor, his employees, agents, or subcontractors.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Other service contracts.</E> Contracting officers entering into general service contracts shall be responsible for determining the appropriateness of including provisions in the contract to prevent potential misuse (inadvertent or otherwise) by employees, agents, or subcontractors of the contractor.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Rules Governing Responsible Department Officials.</E> In addition to the requirements for Systems Employees, responsible Department officials shall:</P>

          <P>(b) To encourage and recognize individual and cooperative achievement in research and investigations; and</P>
          <P>(c) To establish a procedure, consistent with pertinent statutes, Executive orders and general Government regulations, for the determination of rights and obligations relating to the patenting of inventions.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 6.1</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Publication or patenting of inventions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>It is the general policy of the Department that the results of Department research should be made widely, promptly and freely available to other research workers and to the public. This availability can generally be adequately preserved by the dedication of a Government-owned invention to the public. Determinations to file a domestic patent application on inventions in which the Department has an interest will be made where the circumstances indicate that this is desirable in the public interest, and if it is practicable to do so. Department determinations not to apply for a domestic patent on employee inventions are subject to review and approval by the Commissioner of Patents. Except where deemed necessary for protecting the patent claim, the fact that a patent application has been or may be filed will not require any departure from normal policy regarding the dissemination of the results of Department research.</P>

          <P>(a) Licenses to practice inventions covered by patents and pending patent applications owned by the U.S. Government as represented by this Department will generally be royalty free, revocable and nonexclusive. They will normally be issued to all applicants and will generally contain no limitations or standards relating to the quality or testing of the products to be manufactured, sold, or distributed thereunder.</P>
          <P>(b) Where it appears however that the public interest will be served under the circumstances of the particular case by licenses which impose conditions, such as those relating to quality or testing of products, requirement of payment of royalties to the Government, etc., or by the issuance of limited exclusive licenses by the Secretary after notice and opportunity for hearing thereon, such licenses may be issued.</P>

Invention reports required from employees or others for the purpose of obtaining determinations of ownership, and documents and information obtained for the purpose of prosecuting patent applications shall be confidential and shall be disclosed only as required for official purposes or with the consent of the inventor.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Who are employees.</SUBJECT>
          <P>As used in this part, the term <E T="03">Government employee</E> means any officer or employee, civilian or military, except such part-time employees or part-time consultants as may be excluded therefrom by a determination made in writing by the head of the employee's office or constituent organization, pursuant to an exemption approved by the Commissioner of Patents that to include him or them would be impracticable or inequitable, given the reasons therefor. A person shall not be considered to be a part-time employee or part-time consultant for this purpose unless the terms of his employment contemplate that he shall work for less than the minimum number of hours per day, or less than a minimum number of days per week, or less than the minimum number of weeks per year, regularly required of full-time employees of his class.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Duty of employee to report inventions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Every Department employee is required to report to the Secretary in accordance with the procedures established therefor, every invention made by him (whether or not jointly with others) which bears any relation to his official duties or which was made in whole or in any part during working hours, or with any contribution of Government facilities, equipment, material, funds, or information, or of time or services of other Government employees on official duty.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 7.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Determination as to domestic rights.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The determination of the ownership of the domestic right, title, and interest in and to an invention which is or may be patentable, made by a Government employee while under the administrative jurisdiction of the Department, will be made in writing by the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 10096 and Government-wide regulations issued thereunder by the Commissioner of Patents as follows:</P>
          <P>(a) The Government as represented by the Secretary shall obtain the entire domestic right, title and interest in and to all inventions made by any Government employee (1) during working hours, or (2) with a contribution by the Government of facilities, equipment, materials, funds, or information, or of time or services of other Government employees on official duty, or (3) which bear a direct relation to or are made in consequence of the official duties of the inventor.</P>

          <P>(b) In any case where the contribution of the Government, as measured by any one or more of the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, to the invention is insufficient equitably to justify a requirement of assignment to the Government of the entire domestic right, title and interest in and to such invention, or in any case where the Government has insufficient interest in an invention to obtain the entire domestic right, title, and interest therein (although the Government could obtain same under paragraph (a) of this section), the Department, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, shall leave title to such invention in the employee, subject, however, to the reservation to the Government of a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention with power to grant licenses for all governmental purposes, such reservation to <PRTPAGE P="29"/>appear, where practicable, in any patent, domestic or foreign, which may issue on such invention.</P>
          <P>(c) In applying the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, to the facts and circumstances relating to the making of any particular invention, it shall be presumed that an invention made by an employee who is employed or assigned (1) to invent or improve or perfect any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, (2) to conduct or perform research, development work, or both, (3) to supervise, direct, coordinate, or review Government financed or conducted research, development work, or both, or (4) to act in a liaison capacity among governmental or nongovernmental agencies or individuals engaged in such work, falls within the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, and it shall be presumed that any invention made by any other employee falls within the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. Either presumption may be rebutted by a showing of the facts and circumstances and shall not preclude a determination that these facts and circumstances justify leaving the entire right, title and interest in and to the invention in the Government employee, subject to law.</P>
          <P>(d) In any case wherein the Government neither (1) obtains the entire domestic right, title and interest in and to an invention pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, nor (2) reserves a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention, with power to grant licenses for all governmental purposes, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the Government shall leave the entire right, title and interest in and to the invention in the Government employee, subject to law.</P>

          <P>In any case where it is determined that all domestic rights should be assigned to the Government, it shall further be determined, pursuant to Executive Order 9865 and Government-wide regulations issued thereunder, that the Government shall reserve an option to require the assignment of such rights in all or in any specified foreign countries. In case where the inventor is not required to assign the patent rights in any foreign country or countries to the Government or the Government fails to exercise its option within such period of time as may be provided by regulations issued by the Commissioner of Patents, any application for a patent which may be filed in such country or countries by the inventor or his assignee shall nevertheless be subject to a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to the Government for all governmental purposes, including the power to issue sublicenses for use in behalf of the Government and/or in furtherance of the foreign policies of the Government.</P>

Notice need not be given if the employee stated in writing that he would agree to the determination of ownership which was in fact made.</P>

            <P>(a) If there is more than one applicant for the same surplus Federal real property, the Secretary transfers or leases the property to the applicant whose proposed program and plan of use the Secretary determines provides the greatest public benefit, using the criteria contained in appendix A to this part that broadly address the weight given to each type of entity applying and its proposed program and plan of use.

            <SUBJECT>How is a Public Benefit Allowance (PBA) calculated?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Secretary calculates a PBA in accordance with the provisions of appendix A to this part taking into account the nature of the applicant, and the need for, impact of, and type of program and plan of use for the property, as described in that appendix.</P>
            <P>(b) The following are illustrative examples of how a PBA would be calculated and applied under appendix A:</P>
            <P>(1) Entity A is a specialized school that has had a building destroyed by fire, and that has existing facilities determined by the Secretary to be between 26 and 50% inadequate. It is proposing to use the surplus Federal real property to add a new physical education program. Entity A would receive a basic PBA of 70%, a 10% hardship organization allowance, a 20% allowance for inadequacy of existing school plant facilities, and a 10% utilization allowance for introduction of new instructional programs. Entity A would have a total PBA of 110%. If Entity A is awarded the surplus Federal real property, it would not be required to pay any cash for the surplus Federal real property, since the total PBA exceeds 100%.</P>
            <P>(2) Entity B proposes to use the surplus Federal real property for nature walks. Because this qualifies as an outdoor educational program, Entity B would receive a basic PBA of 40%. If Entity B is awarded the surplus Federal real property, it would be required to pay 60% of the fair market value of the surplus Federal real property in cash at the time of the transfer.</P>
            <P>(3) Entity C is an accredited university, has an ROTC unit, and proposes to use the surplus Federal real property for a school health clinic and for special education of the physically handicapped. Entity C would receive a basic PBA of 50% (as a college or university), a 20% accreditation organization allowance (accredited college or university), a 10% public service training organization allowance (ROTC), a 10% student health and welfare utilization allowance (school health clinic), and a 10% service to the handicapped utilization allowance (education of the physically handicapped). Entity C would have a total PBA of 100%. If Entity C is awarded the surplus Federal real property, it would not be required to pay any cash for the surplus Federal real property, since the total PBA is 100%.</P>
            <P>(4) Entities A, B, and C all submit applications for the same surplus Federal real property. Unless the Secretary decides to apportion it, the Secretary transfers or leases the surplus Federal real property to Entity A, since its proposed program and plan of use has the highest total PBA.</P>

            <P>(1)(i) If the attorney, agent, or expert witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services; or</P>
            <P>(ii) If the attorney, agent, or expert witness is an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services.</P>
            <P>(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or expert witness ordinarily performs services.</P>
            <P>(3) The time the attorney, agent, or expert witness actually spent on the applicant's behalf with respect to the adversary adjudication.</P>
            <P>(4) The time the attorney, agent, or expert witness reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the covered issues in the adversary adjudication.</P>
            <P>(5) Any other factors that may bear on the value of the services provided by the attorney, agent, or expert witness.</P>
            <P>(b) The adjudicative officer may not grant—</P>
            <P>(1) An award for the fee of an attorney or agent in excess of $75.00 per hour; or</P>
            <P>(2) An award to compensate an expert witness in excess of the highest rate at which the Department pays expert witnesses.</P>

            <P>(2) The costs claimed by the applicant for this item or items are reasonable.</P>

            <P>(d) The adjudicative officer may not make an award to an eligible party if the adjudicative officer, the CRRA, or the Secretary on review finds that, <PRTPAGE P="48"/>based on a review of the administrative record as a whole—</P>
            <P>(1) The position of the Department, as defined in § 21.3, was substantially justified; or</P>

              <P>(c)(1) In determining whether a debtor has requested an opportunity set forth under paragraph (b)(3) of this section in a timely manner, the Secretary relies on:</P>
              <P>(i) A legibly dated U.S. Postal Service postmark for the debtor's request; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A legibly stamped U.S. Postal service mail receipt for debtor's request.</P>

              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>The U.S. Postal Service does not uniformly provide a dated postmark. Before relying on this method for proof of mailing, a debtor should check with its local post office.</P>

            <P>(2) The Secretary determines that the charging of interest or the collection of administrative costs or penalties is—</P>
            <P>(i) Against equity and good conscience; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Not in the best interests of the United States.</P>
            <P>(c) The Secretary may exercise waiver under paragraph (b)(1) of this section without regard to the amount of the debt.</P>
            <P>(d) The Secretary may exercise waiver under paragraph (b)(2) of this section if—</P>
            <P>(1) The Secretary has accepted an installment plan under 4 CFR 102.11;</P>
            <P>(2) There is no indication of fault or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor; and</P>
            <P>(3) The amount of interest, administrative costs, and penalties is such a large portion of the installments that the debt may never be repaid if that amount is collected.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) The Secretary does not charge interest on any portion of a debt, other than a loan, owed by a person subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 if the debt is paid within 30 days after the date of the first demand for payment.</P>
            <P>(2) The Secretary may extend the period under paragraph (e)(1) of this section if the Secretary determines that the extension is appropriate.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 30.70</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How does the Secretary exercise discretion to compromise a debt or to suspend or terminate collection of a debt?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) The Secretary uses the standards in the FCCS, 31 CFR part 902, to determine whether compromise of a debt is appropriate if the debt arises under a program administered by the Department, unless compromise of the debt is subject to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) If the amount of the debt is more than $100,000, or such higher amount as the Department of Justice may prescribe, the Secretary refers a proposed compromise of the debt to the Department of Justice for approval, unless the compromise is subject to paragraph (b) of this section or the debt is one described in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) Under the provisions in 34 CFR 81.36, the Secretary may enter into certain compromises of debts arising because a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement under an applicable Department program has spent some of these funds in a manner that is not allowable. For purposes of this section, neither a program authorized under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), nor the Impact Aid Program is an applicable Department program.</P>

            <P>(c)(1) The Secretary uses the standards in the FCCS, 31 CFR part 903, to determine whether suspension or termination of collection action on a debt is appropriate.<PRTPAGE P="60"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (e), the Secretary—</P>
            <P>(i) Refers the debt to the Department of Justice to decide whether to suspend or terminate collection action if the amount of the debt outstanding at the time of the referral is more than $100,000 or such higher amount as the Department of Justice may prescribe; or</P>
            <P>(ii) May suspend or terminate collection action if the amount of the debt outstanding at the time of the Secretary's determination that suspension or termination is warranted is less than or equal to $100,000 or such higher amount as the Department of Justice may prescribe.</P>
            <P>(d) In determining the amount of a debt under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the Secretary deducts any partial payments or recoveries already received, and excludes interest, penalties, and administrative costs.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) Subject to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, under the provisions of 31 CFR part 902 or 903, the Secretary may compromise a debt in any amount, or suspend or terminate collection of a debt in any amount, if the debt arises under the Federal Family Education Loan Program authorized under title IV, part B, of the HEA, the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program authorized under title IV, part D of the HEA, or the Perkins Loan Program authorized under title IV, part E, of the HEA.</P>
            <P>(2) The Secretary refers a proposed compromise, or suspension or termination of collection, of a debt that exceeds $1,000,000 and that arises under a loan program described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to the Department of Justice for review. The Secretary does not compromise, or suspend or terminate collection of, a debt referred to the Department of Justice for review until the Department of Justice has provided a response to that request.</P>
            <P>(f) The Secretary refers a proposed resolution of a debt to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) for review and approval before referring the debt to the Department of Justice if—</P>
            <P>(1) The debt arose from an audit exception taken by GAO to a payment made by the Department; and</P>
            <P>(2) The GAO has not granted an exception from the GAO referral requirement.</P>
            <P>(g) Nothing in this section precludes—</P>
            <P>(1) A contracting officer from exercising his authority under applicable statutes, regulations, or common law to settle disputed claims relating to a contract; or</P>
            <P>(2) The Secretary from redetermining a claim.</P>
            <P>(h) Nothing in this section authorizes the Secretary to compromise, or suspend or terminate collection of, a debt—</P>
            <P>(1) Based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws; or</P>
            <P>(2) Involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Voluntary repayment agreement.</E> Within 7 days of receipt of the written notice under § 32.3, the employee may submit a request to the Secretary to arrange for a voluntary repayment schedule.

The Secretary notifies the employee, in writing, whether the Secretary will reduce the rate of the involuntary deduction.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Pre-offset hearing—general.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) An employee who wishes a review of the existence or amount of the overpayment or an involuntary repayment schedule may request a pre-offset hearing. The pre-offset hearing does not review:</P>
          <P>(1) The denial of a waiver of repayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584;</P>
          <P>(2) The involuntary repayment schedule or financial hardship caused by the amount of the involuntary deduction from the employee's disposable pay, unless the employee has submitted the financial statement and written explanation required under § 32.4(c); and</P>
          <P>(3) The determination under paragraph (b) of this section that the pre-offset hearing is on the written submissions.</P>
          <P>(b) Unless the Secretary determines that a matter reviewable under paragraph (a) of this section turns on an issue of credibility or veracity or cannot be resolved by a review of the documentary evidence, the pre-offset hearing is on the written submissions.</P>
          <P>(c) A pre-offset hearing is based on the written submissions for overpayments arising from:</P>
          <P>(1) A termination of a temporary promotion;</P>
          <P>(2) A cash award;</P>
          <P>(3) An erroneous salary rate;</P>
          <P>(4) Premature granting of a within-grade increase;</P>
          <P>(5) A lump sum payment for annual leave;</P>
          <P>(6) Unauthorized appointment to a position;</P>
          <P>(7) An error on time and attendance records; or</P>
          <P>(8) Other circumstances where the Secretary determines that an oral hearing is not required.</P>

          <P>(d) The hearing is conducted by a hearing official who is not an employee <PRTPAGE P="70"/>of the Department or under the supervision or control of the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(e) Formal discovery between the parties is not provided.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 32.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Request for a pre-offset hearing.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Except for an employee who has requested a waiver of collection of the debt under § 32.4(b), an employee who wishes a pre-offset hearing must request the hearing within 15 days of receipt of the written notice given under § 32.3. The Secretary waives the 15-day requirement if the employee shows that the delay was because of circumstances beyond his or her control or because of failure to receive notice and lack of knowledge of the time limit.</P>
          <P>(b) An employee who has requested a waiver under § 32.4(b) may request a hearing within 10 days of receipt of a determination by the Secretary denying a waiver.</P>
          <P>(c) The request for a hearing must:</P>
          <P>(1) Be in writing;</P>
          <P>(2) State why the employee:</P>
          <P>(i) Contests the existence or amount of the overpayment; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Claims that the involuntary repayment schedule will cause extreme financial hardship;</P>
          <P>(3) Include all documents on which the employee is relying, other than those provided by the Secretary under § 32.3; any document which is a statement of an individual must be in the form of an affidavit; and</P>
          <P>(4) Be submitted to the designated hearing official with a copy to the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(d) If the employee timely requests a pre-offset hearing or the timelines are waived under paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary:</P>
          <P>(1) Notifies the employee whether the employee may elect an oral hearing; and</P>
          <P>(2) Provides the hearing official with a copy of all records on which the determination of the overpayment and any involuntary repayment schedule are based.</P>
          <P>(e) An employee who has been given the opportunity to elect an oral hearing and who does elect an oral hearing must notify the hearing official and the Secretary of his or her election in writing within 7 days of receipt of the notice under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and must identify all proposed witnesses and all facts and evidence about which they will testify.</P>
          <P>(f) Where an employee requests an oral hearing, the hearing official notifies the Secretary and the employee of the date, time, and location of the hearing. However:</P>
          <P>(1) The employee subsequently may elect to have the hearing based only on the written submissions by notifying the hearing official and the Secretary at least 3 calendar days before the date of the oral hearing. The hearing official may waive the 3-day requirement for good cause when the employee notifies the hearing official before the date of the hearing; and</P>
          <P>(2) The request for a hearing of an employee who fails to appear at the oral hearing must be dismissed and the Secretary's decision affirmed.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Pre-offset oral hearing.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Oral hearings are informal in nature. The Secretary and the employee, through their representatives, and by reference to the documentation submitted, explain their case. The employee may testify on his or her own behalf, subject to cross examination. Other witnesses may be called to testify only where the hearing official determines that their testimony is relevant and not redundant.</P>
          <P>(b) The hearing official shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Conduct a fair and impartial hearing; and</P>
          <P>(2) Preside over the course of the hearing, maintain decorum, and avoid delay in the disposition of the hearing.</P>
          <P>(c) The employee may represent himself or herself or may be represented by another person at the hearing. The employee may not be represented by a person whose representation creates an actual or apparent conflict of interest.</P>
          <P>(d) Oral hearings are open to the public. However, the hearing official may close all or any portion of the hearing where to do so is in the best interests of the employee or the public.</P>

          <P>(e) Oral hearings may be conducted by conference call—<PRTPAGE P="71"/>
          </P>
          <P>(1) If the employee is located in a city outside the Washington, DC Metropolitan area;</P>
          <P>(2) At the request of the employee; or</P>
          <P>(3) At the discretion of the hearing official.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 32.9</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Written decision.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The hearing official issues a written decision stating the facts supporting the nature and origin of the debt and the hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions as to the amount of the debt and the repayment schedule within 60 days of filing of the employee's request for a pre-offset hearing, unless the employee requests, and the hearing official grants, a delay in the proceedings.</P>
          <P>(b) The hearing official decides whether the Secretary's determination of the existence and the amount of the overpayment or the extreme financial hardship caused by the involuntary repayment schedule is clearly erroneous. A determination is clearly erroneous if although there is evidence to support the determination, the hearing official, considering the record as a whole, is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake was made.</P>
          <P>(c) In making the decision, the hearing official is governed by applicable Federal statutes, rules and regulations.</P>
          <P>(d) The hearing official decides the issue of extreme financial hardship caused by the involuntary repayment schedule only where the employee has submitted the financial statement and written explanation required under § 32.4(c). Where the hearing official determines that the involuntary repayment schedule creates extreme financial hardship, he or she must establish a schedule that alleviates the financial hardship but may not reduce the involuntary repayment schedule to a deduction of zero percent.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 32.10</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Deductions process.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Debts must be collected in one lump sum where possible. If the employee does not agree to a lump sum that exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay, the debt must be collected in installment deductions at officially established pay intervals in the amount established under:</P>
          <P>(1) A voluntary repayment agreement;</P>
          <P>(2) An involuntary repayment schedule where no hearing is requested; or</P>
          <P>(3) The schedule established under the written hearing decision.</P>
          <P>(b) Installment deductions must be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment, except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section. If possible, the installment payment must be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in, at most, three years. Installment payments of less than $25 may be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.</P>
          <P>(c) Deductions must begin:</P>
          <P>(1) After the employee has entered a voluntary repayment schedule;</P>
          <P>(2) If a waiver is requested under § 32.4(b), after the employee has been denied a waiver by the Secretary; or</P>
          <P>(3) If a hearing is requested under § 32.5, after a written decision.</P>

          <P>(d) If the employee retires or resigns or his or her employment ends before collection of the debt is completed, the amount necessary to liquidate the debt must be offset from subsequent payments of any nature (for example, final salary payment and/or lump sum annual leave payment) due the employee on the date of separation. If the debt cannot be liquidated by offset from any such final payment due the employee on the date of separation, the debt must be liquidated by administrative offset pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 from later payments of any kind due the employee, where appropriate. After the Secretary has complied with the procedures in this part, the Secretary may refer the debt to a paying agency for collection by offset under 5 CFR 550.1108.<PRTPAGE P="72"/>
          </P>
          <P>(e) Interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts collected under this part must be assessed, in accordance with the provisions of 4 CFR 102.13.</P>
          <P>(f) An employee's payment, whether voluntary or involuntary, of all or any portion of an alleged debt collected pursuant to this part may not be construed as a waiver of any rights which the employee may have under this part or any other provision of law, except as otherwise provided by law.</P>
          <P>(g) Amounts paid or deducted pursuant to this part by an employee for a debt that is waived or otherwise found not owing to the United States or which the Secretary is ordered to refund must be promptly refunded to the employee.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the Department head, upon appeal, evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating fraudulent conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages <PRTPAGE P="84"/>and a significant civil penalty is imposed.</P>

          <P>(b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the Department head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:</P>
          <P>(1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements.</P>
          <P>(2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made.</P>
          <P>(3) The degree of the defendent's culpability with respect to the misconduct.</P>
          <P>(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed.</P>
          <P>(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation.</P>
          <P>(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss.</P>
          <P>(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs.</P>
          <P>(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct.</P>
          <P>(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct.</P>
          <P>(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it.</P>
          <P>(11) If the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude the misconduct.</P>
          <P>(12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct.</P>
          <P>(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers.</P>
          <P>(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions.</P>
          <P>(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly.</P>
          <P>(16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.</P>
          <P>(c) Nothing in this section may be construed to limit the ALJ or the Department head from considering any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.</P>

Any such written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of the witness, in a manner that allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena the witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts must be exchanged as provided in § 33.22(a).<PRTPAGE P="85"/>
          </P>
          <P>(c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:</P>

          <P>(e) At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on matters relevant to the proceeding without regard to the scope of his or her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination must be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.</P>
          <P>(f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of—</P>
          <P>(1) A party who is an individual;</P>

          <P>(a)(1) We have the burden of proving the existence and amount of a debt.</P>
          <P>(2) We meet this burden by including in the record and making available to the debtor on request records that show that—</P>
          <P>(i) The debt exists in the amount stated in the garnishment notice; and</P>
          <P>(ii) The debt is currently delinquent.</P>
          <P>(b) If you dispute the existence or amount of the debt, you must prove by a preponderance of the credible evidence that—</P>
          <P>(1) No debt exists;</P>
          <P>(2) The amount we claim to be owed on the debt is incorrect, or</P>
          <P>(3) You are not delinquent with respect to the debt.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) If you object that the proposed garnishment rate would cause financial hardship, you bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the credible evidence that withholding the amount of wages proposed in the notice would leave you unable to meet the basic living expenses of you and your dependents.</P>
          <P>(2) The standards for proving financial hardship are those in § 34.24.</P>

          <P>(d)(1) If you object on the ground that applicable law bars us from collecting the debt by garnishment at this time, you bear the burden of proving the facts that would establish that claim.<PRTPAGE P="93"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) Examples of applicable law that may prevent collection by garnishment include the automatic stay in bankruptcy (11 U.S.C. 362(a)), and the preclusion of garnishment action against a debtor who was involuntarily separated from employment and has been reemployed for less than a continuous period of 12 months (31 U.S.C. 3720D(b)(6)).</P>
          <P>(e) The fact that applicable law may limit the amount that an employer may withhold from your pay to less than the amount or rate we state in the garnishment order does not bar us from issuing the order.</P>

          <P>(b) You may, at any time, object that the amount or the rate of withholding which our order specifies your employer must withhold causes financial hardship.</P>

          <P>(4) If you claim for any basic living expense an amount that exceeds the amount in the National Standards, you must prove that the amount you claim is reasonable and necessary.</P>

            <P>(a) For purposes of the regulations in this part, a claim shall be deemed to have been presented when the Department of Education receives, at a place designated in paragraph (b) of this section, an executed Standard Form 95 or other written notification of an incident accompanied by a claim for money damages in a sum certain for damage to or loss of property, for personal injury, or for death, alleged to have occurred by reason of the incident. A claim which should have been presented to the Department but which was mistakenly addressed to or filed with another Federal agency, shall be deemed to be presented to the Department as of the date that the claim is received by the Department. A claim mistakenly addressed to or filed with the Department shall forthwith be transferred to the appropriate Federal agency, if ascertainable, or returned to the claimant.</P>
            <P>(b) A claim presented in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final action by the Secretary or prior to the exercise of the claimant's option to bring suit under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). Amendments shall be submitted in writing and signed by the claimant or his duly authorized agent or legal representative. Upon the timely filing of an amendment to a pending claim, the Department shall have 6 months in which to make a final disposition of the claim as amended and the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) shall not accrue until 6 months after the filing of an amendment.</P>

          <P>Any person in Government service should:</P>
          <P>Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or Government department.</P>

          <P>Uphold the Constitution, laws, and regulations of the United States and of all governments therein and never be a party to their evasion.<PRTPAGE P="103"/>
          </P>
          <P>Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay; giving earnest effort and best thought to the performance of duties.</P>
          <P>Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished.</P>
          <P>Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and never accept, for himself or herself or for family members, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of governmental duties.</P>
          <P>Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a Government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty.</P>
          <P>Engage in no business with the Government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of governmental duties.</P>
          <P>Never use any information gained confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means of making private profit.</P>
          <P>Expose corruption wherever discovered.</P>

          <P>Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.
          </P>

              <P>(a) The regulations in part 75 apply to each direct grant program of the Department of Education.</P>

              <P>(b) If a direct grant program does not have implementing regulations, the Secretary implements the program under the authorizing statute and, to the extent consistent with the authorizing statute, under the General Education Provisions Act and the regulations in this part. For the purposes of this part, the term “direct grant program” includes any grant program of the Department other than a program whose authorizing statute or implementing regulations provide a formula for allocating program funds among eligible States. With respect to Public Law 81-874 (the Impact Aid Program), the term “direct grant program” includes only the entitlement increase for children with disabilities under section 3(d)(2)(C) of Public Law 81-874 (20 <PRTPAGE P="106"/>U.S.C. 238(d)(2)(C) and disaster assistance under section 7 of that law (20 U.S.C. 241-1).

              <P>(b) An applicant may show that it is a nonprofit organization by any of the following means:</P>

              <P>(3) A certified copy of the applicant's certificate of incorporation or similar document if it clearly establishes the nonprofit status of the applicant; or</P>
              <P>(4) Any item described in paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section if that item applies to a State or national parent organization, together with a statement by the State or parent organization that the applicant is a local nonprofit affiliate.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility of faith-based organizations for a grant and nondiscrimination against those organizations.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a)(1) A faith-based organization is eligible to apply for and to receive a grant under a program of the Department on the same basis as any other <PRTPAGE P="107"/>private organization, with respect to programs for which such other organizations are eligible.</P>
              <P>(2) In the selection of grantees, the Department may not discriminate for or against a private organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation and must ensure that all decisions about grant awards are free from political interference, or even the appearance of such interference, and are made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of religion or religious belief, or the lack thereof.</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions of § 75.532 apply to a faith-based organization that receives a grant under a program of the Department.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) A private organization that engages in explicitly religious activities, such as religious worship, instruction, or proselytization, must offer those activities separately in time or location from any programs or services supported by a grant from the Department, and attendance or participation in any such explicitly religious activities by beneficiaries of the programs and services supported by the grant must be voluntary.</P>
              <P>(2) The limitations on explicitly religious activities under paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply to a faith-based organization that provides services to a beneficiary under a program supported only by “indirect Federal financial assistance.”</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of 2 CFR 3474.15, 34 CFR 75.52, 75.712, 75.713, 75.714, and appendix A to this part, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>(i) Direct Federal financial assistance means that the Department, a grantee, or a subgrantee selects a provider and either purchases goods or services from that provider (such as through a contract) or awards funds to that provider (such as through a grant, subgrant, or cooperative agreement) to carry out services under a program of the Department. Federal financial assistance shall be treated as direct unless it meets the definition of “indirect Federal financial assistance.”</P>
              <P>(ii) Indirect Federal financial assistance means that the choice of a service provider under a program of the Department is placed in the hands of the beneficiary, and the cost of that service is paid through a voucher, certificate, or other similar means of government-funded payment. Federal financial assistance provided to an organization is “indirect” under this definition if—</P>
              <P>(A) The government program through which the beneficiary receives the voucher, certificate, or other similar means of government-funded payment is neutral toward religion;</P>
              <P>(B) The organization receives the assistance as the result of the decision of the beneficiary, not a decision of the government; and</P>

              <P>(C) The beneficiary has at least one adequate secular option for use of the voucher, certificate, or other similar means of government-funded payment.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note to paragraph (<E T="01">c</E>)(3):</HD>
                <P>The definitions of “direct Federal financial assistance” and “indirect Federal financial assistance” do not change the extent to which an organization is considered a “recipient” of “Federal financial assistance” as those terms are defined under 34 CFR parts 100, 104, 106, and 110.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>(d)(1) A faith-based organization that applies for or receives a grant under a program of the Department may retain its independence, autonomy, right of expression, religious character, and authority over its governance.</P>
              <P>(2) A faith-based organization may, among other things—</P>
              <P>(i) Retain religious terms in its name;</P>
              <P>(ii) Continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs;</P>
              <P>(iii) Use its facilities to provide services without removing or altering religious art, icons, scriptures, or other symbols from these facilities;</P>
              <P>(iv) Select its board members and otherwise govern itself on a religious basis; and</P>
              <P>(v) Include religious references in its mission statement and other chartering or governing documents.</P>

              <P>(e) A private organization that receives any Federal financial assistance under a program of the Department shall not discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary in the provision of program services or in outreach activities on the basis of religion or religious belief, a refusal to <PRTPAGE P="108"/>hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice. However, an organization that participates in a program funded by indirect financial assistance need not modify its program activities to accommodate a beneficiary who chooses to expend the indirect aid on the organization's program.</P>
              <P>(f) If a grantee contributes its own funds in excess of those funds required by a matching or grant agreement to supplement federally funded activities, the grantee has the option to segregate those additional funds or commingle them with the funds required by the matching requirements or grant agreement. However, if the additional funds are commingled, this section applies to all of the commingled funds.</P>

              <P>(g) A religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1, is not forfeited when the organization receives financial assistance from the Department.

              <P>(iii) Publishing proposed annual priorities would seriously interfere with an orderly, responsible grant award process or would otherwise be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest;</P>
              <P>(iv) The program statute requires or authorizes the Secretary to establish specified priorities; or</P>
              <P>(v) The annual priorities are chosen from allowable activities specified in the program statute.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">How does the Secretary implement an annual priority?</E> The Secretary may choose one or more of the following methods to implement an annual priority:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Invitations.</E> The Secretary may simply invite applications that meet a priority. If the Secetary chooses this method, an application that meets the priority receives no competitive or absolute preference over applications that do not meet the priority.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Competitive preference.</E> The Secretary may give one of the following kinds of competitive preference to applications that meet a priority.</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary may award some or all bonus points to an application depending on the extent to which the application meets the priority. These points are in addition to any points the applicant earns under the selection criteria (see § 75.200(b)). The notice states the maximum number of additional points that the Secretary may award to an application depending upon how well the application meets the priority.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary may select an application that meets a priority over an application of comparable merit that does not meet the priority.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Absolute preference.</E> The Secretary may give an absolute preference to applications that meet a priority. The Secretary establishes a separate competition for applications that meet the priority and reserves all or part of a program's funds solely for that competition. The Secretary may adjust the amount reserved for the priority after determining the number of high quality applications received.</P>

              <P>(a) Before the Secretary sets the amount of a new grant, the Secretary does a cost analysis of the project. The Secretary:</P>
              <P>(1) Verifies the cost data in the detailed budget for the project;</P>
              <P>(2) Evaluates specific elements of costs; and</P>

              <P>(b) The Secretary uses the cost analysis as a basis for determining the amount of the grant to the applicant. The cost analysis shows whether the applicant can achieve the objectives of the project with reasonable efficiency and economy under the budget in the application.</P>

              <P>(3) Commercial (for-profit) organizations, at 48 CFR part 31 Contract Cost Principles and Procedures.</P>
              <P>(b) A grantee must have obtained a current indirect cost rate agreement from its cognizant agency, to charge indirect costs to a grant. To obtain an indirect cost rate, a grantee must submit an indirect cost proposal to its cognizant agency within 90 days after the date the Department issues the Grant Award Notification (GAN).</P>
              <P>(c) If a grantee does not have a federally recognized indirect cost rate agreement, the Secretary may permit the grantee to charge its grant for indirect costs at a temporary rate of 10 percent of budgeted direct salaries and wages.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) If a grantee fails to submit an indirect cost rate proposal to its cognizant agency within the required 90 days, the grantee may not charge indirect costs to its grant from the end of the 90-day period until it obtains a federally recognized indirect cost rate agreement applicable to the grant.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary determines that exceptional circumstances warrant continuation of a temporary indirect cost rate, the Secretary may authorize the grantee to continue charging indirect costs to its grant at the temporary rate specified in paragraph (c) of this section even though the grantee has not submitted its indirect cost rate proposal within the 90-day period.</P>
              <P>(3) Once a grantee obtains a federally recognized indirect cost rate that is applicable to the affected grant, the grantee may use that indirect cost rate to claim indirect cost reimbursement for expenditures made on or after the date the grantee submitted its indirect cost proposal to its cognizant agency or the start of the project period, whichever is later. However, this authority is subject to the following limitations:</P>
              <P>(i) The total amount of funds recovered by the grantee under the federally recognized indirect cost rate is reduced by the amount of indirect costs previously recovered under the temporary indirect cost rate.</P>
              <P>(ii) The grantee must obtain prior approval from the Secretary to shift direct costs to indirect costs in order to recover indirect costs at a higher negotiated indirect cost rate.</P>
              <P>(iii) The grantee may not request additional funds to recover indirect costs that it cannot recover by shifting direct costs to indirect costs.</P>
              <P>(e) The Secretary accepts an indirect cost rate negotiated by a grantee's cognizant agency, but may establish a restricted indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the statutory requirements of certain programs administered by the Department.</P>

              <P>(d) A grantee using the training rate of eight percent is required to have documentation available for audit that shows that its negotiated indirect cost rate is at least eight percent.</P>

              <P>(a) A faith-based organization that receives a grant, subgrant, or contract under a program of the Department supported in whole or in part by direct Federal financial assistance must give written notice to a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary of certain protections. This notice must state that:</P>
              <P>(1) The organization may not discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary on the basis of religion or religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice;</P>
              <P>(2) The organization may not require a beneficiary to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities that are offered by the organization, and any participation by the beneficiaries in such activities must be purely voluntary;</P>
              <P>(3) The organization must separate in time or location any privately funded explicitly religious activities from activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance;</P>

              <P>(4) If a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary objects to the religious character of the organization, the organization will undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider to <PRTPAGE P="139"/>which the beneficiary has no objection; and</P>

              <P>(b)(1) A faith-based organization that receives a grant, subgrant, or contract under a program of the Department must provide beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries with the written notice required under paragraph (a) of this section prior to the time they enroll in or receive services from the organization.</P>
              <P>(2) When the nature of the services provided or exigent circumstances make it impracticable to provide the written notice in advance of the actual services, the organization must advise beneficiaries of their protections at the earliest available opportunity.</P>
              <P>(c) The notice that a faith-based organization must use to notify beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries of their rights under paragraph (a) of this section is specified in appendix A to this part.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) A faith-based organization may satisfy the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section by referring a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary to another faith-based organization if the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary does not object to that provider.</P>
              <P>(2) If the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary requests a secular provider, and one is available, the faith-based organization must make a referral to that provider.</P>
              <P>(c) The faith-based organization must make a referral to an alternative provider that—</P>
              <P>(1) Is in reasonable geographic proximity to the location where the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary is receiving or would receive services (except for services provided by telephone, internet, or similar means);</P>
              <P>(2) Offers services that are similar in substance and quality to those offered by the organization; and</P>
              <P>(3) Has the capacity to accept additional beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) When a faith-based organization makes a referral to an alternative provider, the organization must maintain a record of the referral in its grant records, including the date of the referral, the name of the alternative provider, its address, and contact information for the alternative provider;</P>
              <P>(2) When a faith-based organization determines that it is unable to identify an alternative provider, the organization must promptly notify the subgrantee, grantee, or Department that made the award under which the referral could not be made. If the organization is unable to identify an alternative provider, the subgrantee, grantee, or Department that made the award under which the referral could not be made must determine whether there is any other suitable alternative provider to which the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary may be referred. If the entity that made the award under which the referral could not be made cannot make a referral, that entity must promptly notify the grantee or the Department, as appropriate, and the grantee or the Department must determine whether a suitable referral can be made.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility of faith-based organizations for a subgrant and nondiscrimination against those organizations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) A faith-based organization is eligible to apply for and to receive a subgrant under a program of the Department on the same basis as any other private organization, with respect to programs for which such other organizations are eligible.</P>

              <P>(2) In the selection of subgrantees and contractors, States may not discriminate for or against a private organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation and must ensure that all decisions <PRTPAGE P="146"/>about subgrants are free from political interference, or even the appearance of such interference, and are made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of religion or religious belief or a lack thereof.</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions of § 76.532 apply to a faith-based organization that receives a subgrant from a State under a State-administered program of the Department.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) A private organization that engages in explicitly religious activities, such as religious worship, instruction, or proselytization, must offer those activities separately in time or location from any programs or services supported by a subgrant from a State under a State-administered program of the Department, and attendance or participation in any such explicitly religious activities by beneficiaries of the programs and services supported by the subgrant must be voluntary.</P>
              <P>(2) The limitations on explicitly religious activities under paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply to a faith-based organization that provides services to a beneficiary under a program supported only by “indirect Federal financial assistance.”</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of 2 CFR 3474.15, 34 CFR 76.52, 76.712, 76.713, and 76.714, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>(i) Direct Federal financial assistance means that the Department, grantee, or subgrantee selects a provider and either purchases services from that provider (such as through a contract) or awards funds to that provider (such as through a grant, subgrant, or cooperative agreement) to carry out services under a program of the Department. Federal financial assistance shall be treated as direct unless it meets the definition of “indirect Federal financial assistance.”</P>
              <P>(ii) Indirect Federal financial assistance means that the choice of a service provider under a program of the Department is placed in the hands of the beneficiary, and the cost of that service is paid through a voucher, certificate, or other similar means of government-funded payment. Federal financial assistance provided to an organization is “indirect” under this definition if—</P>
              <P>(A) The government program through which the beneficiary receives the voucher, certificate, or other similar means of government-funded payment is neutral toward religion;</P>
              <P>(B) The organization receives the assistance as the result of the decision of the beneficiary, not a decision of the government; and</P>

              <P>(C) The beneficiary has at least one adequate secular option for use of the voucher, certificate, or other similar means of government-funded payment.

              <P>(d)(1) A faith-based organization that applies for or receives a subgrant from a State under a State-administered program of the Department may retain its independence, autonomy, right of expression, religious character, and authority over its governance.</P>
              <P>(2) A faith-based organization may, among other things—</P>
              <P>(i) Retain religious terms in its name;</P>
              <P>(ii) Continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs;</P>
              <P>(iii) Use its facilities to provide services without removing or altering religious art, icons, scriptures, or other symbols from these facilities;</P>
              <P>(iv) Select its board members and otherwise govern itself on a religious basis; and</P>
              <P>(v) Include religious references in its mission statement and other chartering or governing documents.</P>

              <P>(e) A private organization that receives any Federal financial assistance under a program of the Department shall not discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary in the provision of program services or in outreach activities on the basis of religion or religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice. However, an organization that participates in a program funded by indirect financial assistance need not <PRTPAGE P="147"/>modify its program activities to accommodate a beneficiary who chooses to expend the indirect aid on the organization's program.</P>
              <P>(f) If a State or subgrantee contributes its own funds in excess of those funds required by a matching or grant agreement to supplement Federally funded activities, the State or subgrantee has the option to segregate those additional funds or commingle them with the funds required by the matching requirements or grant agreement. However, if the additional funds are commingled, this section applies to all of the commingled funds.</P>

              <P>(g) A religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1, is not forfeited when the organization receives financial assistance from the Department.

              <SUBJECT>When a State may begin to obligate funds.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The Secretary may establish, for a program subject to this part, a date by which a State must submit for review by the Department a State plan and any other documents required to be submitted under guidance provided by the Department under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary does not establish a date for the submission of State plans and any other documents required under guidance provided by the Department, the date for submission is three months before the date the Secretary may begin to obligate funds under the program.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) This paragraph (b) describes the circumstances under which the submission date for a State plan may be deferred.</P>
              <P>(2) If a State asks the Secretary in writing to defer the submission date for a State plan because of a Presidentially declared disaster that has occurred in that State, the Secretary may defer the submission date for the State plan and any other document required under guidance provided by the Department if the Secretary determines that the disaster significantly impairs the ability of the State to submit a timely State plan or other document required under guidance provided by the Department.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) The Secretary establishes, for a program subject to this part, a date by which the program office must deliver guidance to the States regarding the contents of the State plan under that program.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary may only establish a date for the delivery of guidance to the States so that there are at least as many days between that date and the date that State plans must be submitted to the Department as there are days between the date that State plans must be submitted to the Department and the date that funds are available for obligation by the Secretary on July 1, or October 1, as appropriate.</P>

              <P>(iii) If a State does not receive the guidance by the date established under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the submission date for the State plan under the program is deferred one day for each day that the guidance is late in being received by the State.

                <P>The following examples describe how the regulations in § 76.703(b)(3) would act to defer the date that a State would have to submit its State plan.</P>
              </NOTE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>

                <P>The Secretary decides that State plans under a forward-funded program must be submitted to the Department by May first. The Secretary must provide guidance to the States under this program by March first, so that the States have at least <PRTPAGE P="166"/>as many days between the guidance date and the submission date (60) as the Department has between the submission date and the date that funds are available for obligation (60). If the program transmits guidance to the States on February 15, specifying that State plans must be submitted by May first, States generally would have to submit State plans by that date. However, if, for example, a State did not receive the guidance until March third, that State would have until May third to submit its State plan because the submission date of its State plan would be deferred one day for each day that the guidance to the State was late.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                <P>If a program publishes the guidance in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on March third, the States would be considered to have received the guidance on that day. Thus, the guidance could not specify a date for the submission of State plans before May second, giving the States 59 days between the date the guidance is published and the submission date and giving the Department 58 days between the submission date and the date that funds are available for obligation.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(c)(1) For the purposes of this section, the submission date of a State plan or other document is the date that the Secretary receives the plan or document.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary does not determine whether a State plan is substantially approvable until the plan and any documents required under guidance provided by the Department have been submitted.</P>
              <P>(3) The Secretary notifies a State when the Department has received the State plan and all documents required under guidance provided by the Department.</P>
              <P>(d) If a State submits a State plan in substantially approvable form (or an amendment to the State plan that makes it substantially approvable), and submits any other document required under guidance provided by the Department, on or before the date the State plan must be submitted to the Department, the State may begin to obligate funds on the date that the funds are first available for obligation by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(e) If a State submits a State plan in substantially approvable form (or an amendment to the State plan that makes it substantially approvable) or any other documents required under guidance provided by the Department after the date the State plan must be submitted to the Department, and—</P>
              <P>(1) The Department determines that the State plan is substantially approvable on or before the date that the funds are first available for obligation by the Secretary, the State may begin to obligate funds on the date that the funds are first available for obligation by the Secretary; or</P>
              <P>(2) The Department determines that the State plan is substantially approvable after the date that the funds are first available for obligation by the Secretary, the State may begin to obligate funds on the earlier of the two following dates:</P>
              <P>(i) The date that the Secretary determines that the State plan is substantially approvable.</P>
              <P>(ii) The date that is determined by adding to the date that funds are first available for obligation by the Secretary—</P>
              <P>(A) The number of days after the date the State plan must be submitted to the Department that the State plan or other document required under guidance provided by the Department is submitted; and</P>
              <P>(B) If applicable, the number of days after the State receives notice that the State plan is not substantially approvable that the State submits additional information that makes the plan substantially approvable.</P>
              <P>(f) Additional information submitted under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section must be signed by the person who submitted the original State plan (or an authorized delegate of that officer).</P>
              <P>(g)(1) If the Department does not complete its review of a State plan during the period established for that review, the Secretary will grant pre-award costs for the period after funds become available for obligation by the Secretary and before the State plan is found substantially approvable.</P>

              <P>(2) The period established for the Department's review of a plan does not include any day after the State has received notice that its plan is not substantially approvable.

              <P>(3) The organization must separate in time or location any privately funded explicitly religious activities from activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance;</P>
              <P>(4) If a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary objects to the religious character of the organization, the organization will undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary has no objection; and</P>

              <P>(5) A beneficiary or prospective beneficiary may report violations of these protections to, or may file a written complaint regarding a denial of services or benefits, with the State agency administering the program or subgrantee that made the award under which the violation occurred.<PRTPAGE P="170"/>

              <P>(b)(1) A faith-based organization may satisfy the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section by referring a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary to another faith-based organization if the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary does not object to that provider.</P>
              <P>(2) If the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary requests a secular provider, and one is available, the faith-based organization must make a referral to that provider.</P>
              <P>(c) The faith-based organization must make a referral to an alternative provider that—</P>
              <P>(1) Is in reasonable geographic proximity to the location where the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary is receiving or would receive services (except for services provided by telephone, internet, or similar means);</P>

              <P>(3) Has the capacity to accept additional beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) When a faith-based organization makes a referral to an alternative provider, the organization must maintain a record of the referral in its grant records, including the date of the referral, the name of the alternative provider, its address, and contact information for the alternative provider.</P>
              <P>(2) When the organization determines that it is unable to identify an alternative provider, the organization must promptly notify the State or subgrantee that made the award under which the referral could not be made. If the organization is unable to identify an alternative provider, the State agency or subgrantee that made the award under which the referral could not be made must determine whether there is any other suitable alternative provider to which the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary may be referred. If the entity that made the award under which the referral could not be made cannot make a referral, that entity must promptly notify the grantee or the Department, as appropriate, and the grantee or the Department must determine whether a suitable referral can be made.</P>

          <P>(i) A randomized controlled trial employs random assignment of, for example, students, teachers, classrooms, or schools to receive the project component being evaluated (the treatment group) or not to receive the project component (the control group).</P>

          <P>(ii) A regression discontinuity design study assigns the project component being evaluated using a measured variable (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> assigning students reading below a cutoff score to tutoring or developmental education classes) and controls for that variable in the analysis of outcomes.</P>

          <P>(iii) A single-case design study uses observations of a single case (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a student eligible for a behavioral intervention) over time in the absence and presence of a controlled treatment manipulation to determine whether the outcome is systematically related to the treatment.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Facilities</E> means one or more structures in one or more locations.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Fiscal year</E> means the Federal fiscal year—a period beginning on October 1 and ending on the following September 30.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">GEPA</E> means The General Education Provisions Act.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Grant</E> means financial assistance, including cooperative agreements, that provides support or stimulation to accomplish a public purpose. 2 CFR part 200, as adopted in 2 CFR part 3474, uses the broader, undefined term “Award” to cover grants, subgrants, and other agreements in the form of money or property, in lieu of money, by the Federal Government to an eligible recipient. The term does not include—</P>
          <P>(1) Technical assistance, which provides services instead of money;</P>
          <P>(2) Other assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, or insurance;</P>
          <P>(3) Direct payments of any kind to individuals; and</P>
          <P>(4) Contracts that are required to be entered into and administered under procurement laws and regulations.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Grantee</E> means the legal entity to which a grant is awarded and that is accountable to the Federal Government for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the entire legal entity <PRTPAGE P="179"/>even if only a particular component of the entity is designated in the grant award notice (GAN). For example, a GAN may name as the grantee one school or campus of a university. In this case, the granting agency usually intends, or actually intends, that the named component assume primary or sole responsibility for administering the grant-assisted project or program. Nevertheless, the naming of a component of a legal entity as the grantee in a grant award document shall not be construed as relieving the whole legal entity from accountability to the Federal Government for the use of the funds provided. (This definition is not intended to affect the eligibility provision of grant programs in which eligibility is limited to organizations that may be only components of a legal entity.) The term “grantee” does not include any secondary recipients, such as subgrantees and contractors, that may receive funds from a grantee pursuant to a subgrant or contract.</P>

          <P>(1) A city, county, township, school district, or other political subdivision of a State; or</P>
          <P>(2) Such combination of school districts or counties a State recognizes as an administrative agency for its public elementary or secondary schools; or</P>
          <P>(b) Any other public institution or agency that has administrative control and direction of a public elementary or secondary school.</P>
          <P>(c) As used in 34 CFR parts 400, 408, 525, 526 and 527 (vocational education programs), the term also includes any other public institution or agency that has administrative control and direction of a vocational education program.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Logic model</E> (also referred to as a theory of action) means a framework that identifies key project components of the proposed project (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the active “ingredients” that are hypothesized to be critical to achieving the relevant outcomes) and describes the theoretical and operational relationships among the key project components and relevant outcomes.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Minor remodeling</E> means minor alterations in a previously completed building. The term also includes the extension of utility lines, such as water and electricity, from points beyond the confines of the space in which the minor remodeling is undertaken but within the confines of the previously completed building. The term does not include building construction, stuctural alterations to buildings, building maintenance, or repairs.</P>

            <P>(a) A ruling by an ALJ may not be appealed to the Secretary until the issuance of an initial decision, except that the Secretary may, at any time prior to the issuance of an initial decision, grant review of a ruling upon either an ALJ's certification of the ruling to the Secretary for review, or the filing of a petition seeking review of an interim ruling by one or both of the parties, if—</P>
            <P>(1) That ruling involves a controlling question of substantive or procedural law; and</P>
            <P>(2) The immediate resolution of the question will materially advance the final disposition of the proceeding or subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) A petition for interlocutory review of an interim ruling must include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) A brief statement of the facts necessary to an understanding of the issue on which review is sought.</P>
            <P>(ii) A statement of the issue.</P>
            <P>(iii) A statement of the reasons showing that the ruling complained of involves a controlling question of substantive or procedural law and why immediate review of the ruling will materially advance the disposition of the case, or why subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy.</P>
            <P>(2) A petition may not exceed ten pages, double-spaced, and must be accompanied by a copy of the ruling and any findings and opinions relating to the ruling. The petition must be filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals, which immediately forwards the petition to the Office of the Secretary.</P>
            <P>(c) A copy of the petition must be provided to the ALJ at the time the petition is filed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and a copy of a petition or any certification must be served upon the parties by certified mail, return receipt requested. The petition or certification must reflect that service.</P>
            <P>(d) If a party files a petition under this section, the ALJ may state to the Secretary a view as to whether review is appropriate or inappropriate by submitting a brief statement addressing the party's petition within 10 days of the ALJ's receipt of the petition for interlocutory review. A copy of the statement must be served on all parties by certified mail, return receipt requested.</P>

            <P>(e)(1) A party's response, if any, to a petition or certification for interlocutory review must be filed within seven days after service of the petition or certification, and may not exceed ten pages, double-spaced, in length. A copy of the response must be filed with the <PRTPAGE P="192"/>ALJ by hand delivery, by regular mail, or by facsimile transmission.</P>
            <P>(2) A party shall serve a copy of its response on all parties on the filing date by hand-delivery or regular mail. If agreed upon by the parties, service of a copy of the response may be made upon the other parties by facsimile transmission.</P>
            <P>(f) The filing of a request for interlocutory review does not automatically stay the proceedings. Rather, a stay during consideration of a petition for review may be granted by the ALJ if the ALJ has certified or stated to the Secretary that review of the ruling is appropriate. The Secretary may order a stay of proceedings at any time after the filing of a request for interlocutory review.</P>
            <P>(g) The Secretary notifies the parties if a petition or certification for interlocutory review is accepted, and may provide the parties a reasonable time within which to submit written argument or other existing material in the administrative record with regard to the merit of the petition or certification.</P>
            <P>(h) If the Secretary takes no action on a request for interlocutory review within 15 days of receipt of it, the request is deemed to be denied.</P>
            <P>(i) The Secretary may affirm, modify, set aside, or remand the ALJ's ruling.</P>

            <P>(4) The recipient's reliance on the guidance was reasonable.</P>
            <P>(c) Mitigating circumstances exist if it would be unjust to compel the recovery of funds because the recipient's violation was caused by the Department's failure to provide timely guidance. To prove mitigating circumstances under this paragraph, the recipient shall prove that—</P>
            <P>(1) The recipient in good faith submitted a written request for guidance with respect to the legality of a proposed expenditure or practice;</P>

            <P>(2) The request was submitted to the Department at the address provided by notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under this section;</P>
            <P>(3) The request—</P>
            <P>(i) Accurately described the proposed expenditure or practice; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Included the facts necessary for the Department's determination of its legality;</P>
            <P>(4) The request contained the certification of the chief legal officer of the appropriate State educational agency that the officer—</P>
            <P>(i) Examined the proposed expenditure or practice; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Believed it was permissible under State and Federal law applicable at the time of the certification;</P>
            <P>(5) The recipient reasonably believed the proposed expenditure or practice was permissible under State and Federal law applicable at the time it submitted the request to the Department;</P>

            <P>(d) Mitigating circumstances exist if it would be unjust to compel the recovery of funds because the recipient's violation was caused by the recipient's compliance with a judicial decree from a court of competent jurisdiction. To prove mitigating circumstances under this paragraph, the recipient shall prove that—</P>
            <P>(1) The recipient was legally bound by the decree;</P>
            <P>(2) The recipient actually relied on the decree when it engaged in the conduct that constituted the violation; and</P>
            <P>(3) The recipient's reliance on the decree was reasonable.</P>
            <P>(e) If a Departmental official authorized to provide the requested guidance responds to a request described in paragraph (c) of this section more than 90 days after its receipt, the recipient that made the request shall comply with the guidance at the earliest practicable time.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Notice of a disallowance decision.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If an authorized Departmental official decides that a recipient must return funds under § 81.30, the official gives the recipient written notice of a disallowance decision. The official sends the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, or other means that ensure proof of receipt.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The notice must establish a prima facie case for the recovery of funds, including an analysis reflecting the value of the program services actually obtained in a determination of harm to the Federal interest.</P>

            <P>(3) A statement that the recipient failed to maintain records required by law or failed to allow an authorized representative of the Secretary access to those records constitutes a prima facie case for the recovery of the funds affected.</P>
            <P>(i) If the recipient failed to maintain records, the statement must briefly describe the types of records that were not maintained and identify the recordkeeping requirement that was violated.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the recipient failed to allow access to records, the statement must briefly describe the recipient's actions that constituted the failure and identify the access requirement that was violated.</P>
            <P>(c) The notice must inform the recipient that it may—</P>
            <P>(1) Obtain a review of the disallowance decision by the OALJ; and</P>
            <P>(2) Request mediation under § 81.13.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix to Part 81—Illustrations of Proportionality</HD>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Ineligible beneficiaries.</E> A State uses 15 percent of its grant to meet the special educational needs of children who were migratory, but who have not migrated for more than five years as a Federal program statute requires for eligibility to participate in the program. Result: Recovery of 15 percent of the grant—all program funds spent for the benefit of those children. Although the services were authorized, the children were not eligible to receive them.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Ineligible beneficiaries.</E> A Federal program designed to meet the special educational needs of gifted and talented children requires that at least 80 percent of the children served in any project must be identified as gifted or talented. A local educational agency (LEA) conducts a project in which 76 students are identified as gifted or talented and 24 are not. The project was designed and implemented to meet the special educational needs of gifted and talented students. Result: The LEA must return five percent of the project costs. The LEA provided authorized services for a project in which the 76 target students had to constitute at least 80 percent of the total. Thus, the maximum number of non-target students permitted was 19. Project costs relating to the remaining five students must be returned.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Ineligible beneficiaries.</E> Same as the example in paragraph (2), except that only 15 percent of the children were identified as gifted or talented. On the basis of the low percentage of these children and other evidence, the authorized Departmental official finds that the project as a whole did not address their special educational needs and was outside the purpose of the statute. Result: The LEA must return its entire award. The difference between the required percentage of gifted and talented children and the percentage actually enrolled is so substantial that, if consistent with other evidence, the official may reasonably conclude the entire grant was misused.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Ineligible beneficiaries.</E> Same as the example in paragraph (2), except that 60 percent of the children were identified as gifted or talented, and it is not clear whether the project was designed or implemented to meet the special educational needs of these children. Result: If it is determined that the project was designed and implemented to serve their special educational needs, the LEA must return 25 percent of the project costs. A project that included 60 target children would meet the requirement that 80 percent of the children served be gifted and talented if it included no more than 15 other children. Thus, while the LEA provided authorized services, only 75 percent of the beneficiaries were authorized to participate in the project (60 target children and 15 others). If the authorized Departmental official, after examining all the relevant facts, determines that the project was not designed and implemented to serve the special educational needs of gifted or talented students, the LEA must return its entire award because it did not provide services authorized by the statute.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Unauthorized activities.</E> An LEA uses ten percent of its grant under a Federal program that authorizes activities only to meet the special educational needs of educationally deprived children to pay for health services that are available to all children in the LEA. All the children who use the Federally funded health services happen to be educationally deprived, and thus eligible to receive program services. Result: Recovery of ten percent of the grant—all program funds spent for the health services. Although the children were eligible to receive program services, the health services were unrelated to a special educational need and, therefore, not authorized by law.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Set-aside requirement.</E> A State uses 22 percent of its grant for one fiscal year under a Federal adult education program to provide programs of equivalency to a certificate of graduation from a secondary school. The adult education program statute restricts those programs to no more than 20 percent of the State's grant. Result: Two percent of the State's grant must be returned. Although all 22 percent of the funds supported adult education, the State had no authority to spend more than 20 percent on secondary school equivalency programs.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Set-aside requirement.</E> A State uses eight percent of its basic State grant under a Federal vocational education program to pay for the excess cost of vocational education services and activities for handicapped individuals. The program statute requires a State to use ten percent of its basic State grant for this purpose. Result: The State must return two percent of its basic State grant, regardless of how it was used. Because the State was required to spend that two percent on services and activities for handicapped individuals and did not do so, it diverted those funds from their intended purposes, and the Federal interest was harmed to that extent.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Excess cost requirement.</E> An LEA uses funds reserved for the disadvantaged under a Federal vocational education program to pay for the cost of the same vocational education services it provides to non-disadvantaged individuals. The program statute requires that funds reserved for the disadvantaged must be <PRTPAGE P="199"/>used to pay only for the supplemental or additional costs of vocational education services that are not provided to other individuals and that are required for disadvantaged individuals to participate in vocational education. Result: All the funds spent on the disadvantaged must be returned. Although the funds were spent to serve the disadvantaged, the funds were available to pay for only the supplemental or additional costs of providing services to the disadvantaged.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Maintenance-of-effort requirement.</E> An LEA participates in a Federal program in fiscal year 1988 that requires it to maintain its expenditures from non-Federal sources for program purposes to receive its full allotment. The program statute requires that non-Federal funds expended in the first preceding fiscal year must be at least 90 percent of non-Federal funds expended in the second preceding fiscal year and provides for a reduction in grant amount proportional to the shortfall in expenditures. No waiver of the requirement is authorized. In fiscal year 1986 the LEA spent $100,000 from non-Federal sources for program purposes; in fiscal year 1987, only $87,000. Result: The LEA must return <FR>1/30</FR> of its fiscal year 1988 grant—the amount of its grant that equals the proportion of its shortfall ($3,000) to the required level of expenditures ($90,000). If, instead, the statute made maintenance of expenditures a clear condition of the LEA's eligibility to receive funds and did not provide for a proportional reduction in the grant award, the LEA would be required to return its entire grant.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Supplanting prohibition.</E> An LEA uses funds under a Federal drug education program to provide drug abuse prevention counseling to students in the eighth grade. The LEA is required to provide that same counseling under State law. Funds under the Federal program statute are subject to a supplement-not-supplant requirement. Result: All the funds used to provide the required counseling to the eighth-grade students must be returned. The Federal funds did not increase the total amount of spending for program purposes because the counseling would have been provided with non-Federal funds if the Federal funds were not available.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Matching requirement.</E> A State receives an allotment of $90,000 for fiscal year 1988 under a Federal adult education program. It expends its full allotment and $8,000 from its own resources for adult education. Under the Federal statute, the Federal share of expenditures for the State's program is 90 percent. Result: The State must return the unmatched Federal funds, or $18,000. Expenditure of a $90,000 Federal allotment required $10,000 in matching State expenditures, $2,000 more than the State's actual expenditures. At a ratio of one State dollar for every nine Federal dollars, $18,000 in Federal funds were unmatched.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Application requirements.</E> In order to receive funds under a Federal program that supports a wide range of activities designed to improve the quality of elementary and secondary education, an LEA submits an application to its State educational agency (SEA) for a subgrant to carry out school-level basic skills development programs. The LEA submits its application after conducting an assessment of the needs of its students in consultation with parents, teachers, community leaders, and interested members of the general public. The Federal program statute requires the application and consultation processes. The SEA reviews the LEA's application, determines that the proposed programs are sound and the application is in compliance with Federal law, and approves the application. After the LEA receives the subgrant, it unilaterally decides to use 20 percent of the funds for gifted and talented elementary school students—an authorized activity under the Federal statute. However, the LEA does not consult with interested parties and does not amend its application. Result: 20 percent of the LEA's subgrant must be returned. The LEA had no legal authority to use Federal funds for programs or activities other than those described in its approved application, and its actions with respect to 20 percent of the subgrant not only impaired the integrity of the application process, but caused significant harm to other Federal interests associated with the program as follows: the required planning process was circumvented because the LEA did not consult with the specified local interests; program accountability was impaired because neither the SEA nor the various local interests that were to be consulted had an opportunity to review and comment on the merits of the gifted and talented program activities, and the LEA never had to justify those activities to them; and fiscal accountability was impaired because the SEA and those various local interests were, in effect, misled by the LEA's unamended application regarding the expenditure of Federal funds.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Harmless violation.</E> Under a Federal program, a grantee is required to establish a 15-member advisory council of affected teachers, school administrators, parents, and students to assist in program design, monitoring, and evaluation. Although the law requires at least three student members of the council, a grantee's council contains only two. The project is carried out, and no damage to the project attributable to the lack of a third student member can be identified. Result: No financial recovery is required, although the grantee must take other appropriate steps to come into compliance with the law. The grantee's violation has not <PRTPAGE P="200"/>measurably harmed a Federal interest associated with the program.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Professional and technical services.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 82.100(a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, <PRTPAGE P="204"/>amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
            <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>

            <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 82.110(a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.</P>

            <P>(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>

            <P>(b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's conviction, you must either_</P>
            <P>(1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or</P>

            <SUBJECT>To what does this policy apply?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as detailed in § 97.104, this policy applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by any Federal department or agency that takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by Federal civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal Government outside the United States. Institutions that are engaged in research described in this paragraph and institutional review boards (IRBs) reviewing research that is subject to this policy must comply with this policy.</P>
            <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(c) Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a particular activity is covered by this policy and this judgment shall be exercised consistent with the ethical principles of the Belmont Report.<SU>62</SU>

            <P>(d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal department or agency but not otherwise covered by this policy comply with some or all of the requirements of this policy.</P>
            <P>(e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent federal laws or regulations that provide additional protections for human subjects.</P>
            <P>(f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or regulations (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections for human subjects.</P>
            <P>(g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections to human subjects of research.</P>

            <P>(h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. In these circumstances, if a department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those provided in this policy, the department or agency head may approve <PRTPAGE P="227"/>the substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the procedural requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise required by statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, notices of these actions as they occur will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or will be otherwise published as provided in department or agency procedures.</P>
            <P>(i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy to specific research activities or classes of research activities otherwise covered by this policy, provided the alternative procedures to be followed are consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.<SU>63</SU>

              <FTREF/> Except when otherwise required by statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward advance notices of these actions to the Office for Human Research Protections, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or any successor office, or to the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency, and shall also publish them in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or in such other manner as provided in department or agency procedures. The waiver notice must include a statement that identifies the conditions under which the waiver will be applied and a justification as to why the waiver is appropriate for the research, including how the decision is consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.</P>

            <P>(a) Each institution engaged in research that is covered by this policy, with the exception of research eligible for exemption under § 97.104, and that is conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements of this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, and approved for Federal-wide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office. Federal departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has provided an assurance that it will comply with the requirements of this policy, as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB (if such certification is required by § 97.103(d)).</P>
            <P>(b) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head prescribes.</P>
            <P>(c) The department or agency head may limit the period during which any assurance shall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict the assurance.</P>
            <P>(d) Certification is required when the research is supported by a Federal department or agency and not otherwise waived under § 97.101(i) or exempted under § 97.104. For such research, institutions shall certify that each proposed research study covered by the assurance and this section has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted as prescribed by the Federal department or agency component supporting the research. Under no condition shall research covered by this section be initiated prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB.</P>

            <P>(e) For nonexempt research involving human subjects covered by this policy (or exempt research for which limited <PRTPAGE P="231"/>IRB review takes place pursuant to § 97.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), or (d)(7) or (8)) that takes place at an institution in which IRB oversight is conducted by an IRB that is not operated by the institution, the institution and the organization operating the IRB shall document the institution's reliance on the IRB for oversight of the research and the responsibilities that each entity will undertake to ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> in a written agreement between the institution and the IRB, by implementation of an institution-wide policy directive providing the allocation of responsibilities between the institution and an IRB that is not affiliated with the institution, or as set forth in a research protocol).</P>

            <P>(a) Unless otherwise required by law or by department or agency heads, research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories in paragraph (d) of this section are exempt from the requirements of this policy, except that such activities must comply with the requirements of this section and as specified in each category.</P>
            <P>(b) Use of the exemption categories for research subject to the requirements of subparts B, C, and D: Application of the exemption categories to research subject to the requirements of 45 CFR part 46, subparts B, C, and D, is as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Subpart B.</E> Each of the exemptions at this section may be applied to research subject to subpart B if the conditions of the exemption are met.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Subpart C.</E> The exemptions at this section do not apply to research subject to subpart C, except for research aimed at involving a broader subject population that only incidentally includes prisoners.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Subpart D.</E> The exemptions at paragraphs (d)(1), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) of this section may be applied to research subject to subpart D if the conditions of the exemption are met. Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section only may apply to research subject to subpart D involving educational tests or the observation of public behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed. Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied to research subject to subpart D.</P>
            <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this policy:</P>
            <P>(1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.</P>
            <P>(2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
            <P>(i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
            <P>(ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 97.111(a)(7).</P>

            <P>(3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or <PRTPAGE P="232"/>written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
            <P>(A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
            <P>(B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
            <P>(C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 97.111(a)(7).</P>
            <P>(ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.</P>
            <P>(iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.</P>

            <P>(a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and agencies and after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for public comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk;</P>
            <P>(ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption under § 97.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).</P>
            <P>(2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in § 97.108(b).</P>

            <P>(c) Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals that have been approved under the procedure.<PRTPAGE P="236"/>

            <SUBJECT>Criteria for IRB approval of research.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:</P>
            <P>(1) Risks to subjects are minimized:</P>
            <P>(i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and</P>
            <P>(ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.</P>

            <P>(2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.</P>
            <P>(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.</P>
            <P>(4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, § 97.116.</P>
            <P>(5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented or appropriately waived in accordance with § 97.117.</P>
            <P>(6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.</P>
            <P>(7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
            <P>(i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget's privacy office and other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, issue guidance to assist IRBs in assessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
            <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by § 97.104(d)(7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the following determinations:</P>
            <P>(i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in accordance with the requirements of § 97.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);</P>
            <P>(ii) Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate, in accordance with § 97.117; and</P>
            <P>(iii) If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
            <P>(b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.</P>

            <P>(5) Except for broad consent obtained in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) Informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.</P>
            <P>(ii) Informed consent as a whole must present information in sufficient detail relating to the research, and must be organized and presented in a way that does not merely provide lists of isolated facts, but rather facilitates the prospective subject's or legally authorized representative's understanding of the reasons why one might or might not want to participate.</P>
            <P>(6) No informed consent may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the legally authorized representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Basic elements of informed consent.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section, in seeking informed consent the following information shall be provided to each subject or the legally authorized representative:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Documentation of informed consent.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written informed consent form approved by the IRB and signed (including in an electronic format) by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A written copy shall be given to the person signing the informed consent form.</P>
            <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the informed consent form may be either of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of § 97.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.</P>
            <P>(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the elements of informed consent required by § 97.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the key information required by § 97.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds any of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;</P>
            <P>(ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or</P>
            <P>(iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.</P>
            <P>(2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement regarding the research.</P>

            <P>ED conducts or funds research in which the IRB finds that more than minimal risk to children is presented by an intervention or procedure that does not hold out the prospect of direct benefit for the individual subject, or by a monitoring procedure which is not likely to contribute to the well-being of the subject, only if the IRB finds that—</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements for permission by parents or guardians and for assent by children.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) In addition to the determinations required under other applicable sections of this subpart, the IRB shall determine that adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children, if in the judgment of the IRB the children are capable of providing assent. In determining whether children are capable of assenting, the IRB shall take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological state of the children involved. This judgment may be made for all children to be involved in research under a particular protocol, or for each child, as the IRB deems appropriate. If the IRB determines that the capability of some or all of the children is so limited that they cannot reasonably be consulted or that the intervention or procedure involved in the research holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health or well-being of the children and is available only in the context of the research, the assent of the children is not a necessary condition for proceeding with the research. Even if the IRB determines that the subjects are capable of assenting, the IRB may still waive the assent requirement under <PRTPAGE P="246"/>circumstances in which consent may be waived in accord with § 97.116.</P>
            <P>(b) In addition to the determinations required under other applicable sections of this subpart, the IRB shall determine, in accordance with and to the extent that consent is required by § 97.116, that adequate provisions are made for soliciting the permission of each child's parent(s) or guardian(s). If parental permission is to be obtained, the IRB may find that the permission of one parent is sufficient for research to be conducted under § 97.404 or § 97.405. If research is covered by §§ 97.406 and 97.407 and permission is to be obtained from parents, both parents must give their permission unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or if only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.</P>
            <P>(c) In addition to the provisions for waiver contained in § 97.116, if the IRB determines that a research protocol is designed for conditions or for a subject population for which parental or guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the subjects (for example, neglected or abused children), it may waive the consent requirements in subpart A of this part and paragraph (b) of this section, provided an appropriate mechanism for protecting the children who will participate as subjects in the research is substituted, and provided further that the waiver is not inconsistent with Federal, State, or local law. The choice of an appropriate mechanism depends upon the nature and purpose of the activities described in the protocol, the risk and anticipated benefit to the research subjects, and their age, maturity, status, and condition.</P>
            <P>(d) Permission by parents or guardians must be documented in accordance with and to the extent required by § 97.117.</P>
            <P>(e) If the IRB determines that assent is required, it shall also determine whether and how assent must be documented.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Wards.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Children who are wards of the State or any other agency, institution, or entity may be included in research approved under § 97.406 or § 97.407 only if that research is—</P>
            <P>(1) Related to their status as wards; or</P>
            <P>(2) Conducted in schools, camps, hospitals, institutions, or similar settings in which the majority of children involved as subjects are not wards.</P>

            <P>(b) If research is approved under paragraph (a) of this section, the IRB shall require appointment of an advocate for each child who is a ward, in addition to any other individual acting on behalf of the child as guardian or <E T="03">in loco parentis.</E> One individual may serve as advocate for more than one child. The advocate must be an individual who has the background and experience to act in, and agrees to act in, the best interest of the child for the duration of the child's participation in the research and who is not associated in any way (except in the role as advocate or member of the IRB) with the research, the investigator or investigators, or the guardian organization.</P>

            <P>The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter referred to as the “Act”) to the end that no person in the United States shall; on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department of Education.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Application of this regulation.</SUBJECT>

            <P>This regulation applies to any program to which Federal financial assistance is authorized to be extended to a recipient under a law administered by the Department, including the Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A of this regulation. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of the regulation pursuant to an application approved prior to such effective date. This regulation does not apply to (a) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts, (b) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended before the effective date of this regulation, (c) the use of any assistance by any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary, or (d) any employment practice, or any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in § 100.3. The fact that a type of Federal assistance is not listed in appendix A shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list by notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.</E> (1) A recipient under any program to which this part applies may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on ground of race, color, or national origin:</P>
            <P>(i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>
            <P>(ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;</P>

            <P>(iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;<PRTPAGE P="278"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
            <P>(v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>
            <P>(vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section).</P>
            <P>(vii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.</P>
            <P>(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
            <P>(3) In determining the site or location of a facilities, an applicant or recipient may not make selections with the effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any programs to which this regulation applies, on the ground of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation.</P>
            <P>(4) As used in this section, the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefits provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(6)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.</P>
            <P>(ii) Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Employment practices.</E> (1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this regulation applies is to provide employment, a recipient may not (directly or through contractual or other arrangements) subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and use of facilities), including programs where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is (i) to reduce the employment of such individuals or to help them through employment to meet subsistence needs, (ii) to assist such individuals through employment to meet expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education or training, (iii) to provide work experience which contributes to the education or training of <PRTPAGE P="279"/>such individuals, or (iv) to provide remunerative activity to such individuals who because of handicaps cannot be readily absorbed in the competitive labor market. The following, under existing laws, have one of the above objectives as a primary objective:</P>
            <P>(A) Projects under the Public Works Acceleration Act, Pub. L. 87-658, 42 U.S.C. 2641-2643.</P>
            <P>(B) Work-study under the Vocational Education Act of 1963, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1371-1374.</P>
            <P>(C) Programs assisted under laws listed in appendix A as respects employment opportunities provided thereunder, or in facilities provided thereunder, which are limited, or for which preference is given, to students, fellows, or other persons in training for the same or related employments.</P>
            <P>(D) Assistance to rehabilitation facilities under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 32-34, 41a and 41b.</P>
            <P>(2) The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to Part III of Executive Order 11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.</P>
            <P>(3) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Indian health and Cuban refugee services.</E> An individual shall not be deemed subjected to discrimination by reason of his exclusion from benefits limited by Federal law to individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin different from his.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Medical emergencies.</E> Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a recipient of Federal financial assistance shall not be deemed to have failed to comply with paragraph (a) of this section if immediate provision of a service or other benefit to an individual is necessary to prevent his death or serious impairment of his health, and such service or other benefit cannot be provided except by or through a medical institution which refuses or fails to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assurances required.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies, except an application to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. In the case of an application for Federal financial assistance to provide real property or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. In the case of personal property the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which he retains ownership or possession of the property. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application. The responsible Department official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other <PRTPAGE P="280"/>participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.</P>
            <P>(2) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein from the Federal Government the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant to any subsequent transfer of the property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible Department official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In the event a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the responsible Department official may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Continuing Federal financial assistance.</E> Every application by a State or a State agency for continuing Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies (including the Federal financial assistance listed in part 2 of appendix A) shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application (1) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this regulation, and (2) provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the program as are found by the responsible Department official to give reasonable assurance that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this regulation.</P>

In any case in which a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future modification of such order.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Assurance from institutions.</E> (1) In the case of any application for Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education (including assistance for construction, for research, for special training project, for student loans <PRTPAGE P="281"/>or for any other purpose), the assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Illustrative application.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The following examples will illustrate the programs aided by Federal financial assistance of the Department. (In all cases the discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin prohibited by title VI of the Act and this regulation, as a condition of the receipt of Federal financial assistance).</P>
            <P>(a) In federally-affected area assistance (Pub. L. 815 and Pub. L. 874) for construction aid and for general support of the operation of elementary or secondary schools, or in more limited support to such schools such as for the acquisition of equipment, the provision of vocational education, or the provision of guidance and counseling services, discrimination by the recipient school district in any of its elementary or secondary schools in the admission of students, or in the treatment of its students in any aspect of the educational process, is prohibited. In this and the following illustrations the prohibition of discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of the grantee or other recipient.</P>
            <P>(b) In a research, training, demonstration, or other grant to a university for activities to be conducted in a graduate school, discrimination in the admission and treatment of students in the graduate school is prohibited, and the prohibition extends to the entire university.</P>
            <P>(c) In a training grant to a hospital or other nonacademic institution, discrimination is prohibited in the selection of individuals to be trained and in their treatment by the grantee during their training. In a research or demonstration grant to such an institution discrimination is prohibited with respect to any educational activity and any provision of medical or other services and any financial aid to individuals incident to the program.</P>
            <P>(d) In grants to assist in the construction of facilities for the provision of health, educational or welfare services, assurances will be required that services will be provided without discrimination, to the same extent that discrimination would be prohibited as a condition of Federal operating grants for the support of such services. Thus, as a condition of grants for the construction of academic, research, or other facilities at institutions of higher education, assurances will be required that there will be no discrimination in the admission or treatment of students.</P>
            <P>(e) Upon transfers of real or personal surplus property for educational uses, discrimination is prohibited to the same extent as in the case of grants for the construction of facilities or the provision of equipment for like purposes.</P>
            <P>(f) Each applicant for a grant for the construction of educational television facilities is required to provide an assurance that it will, in its broadcast services, give due consideration to the interests of all significant racial or ethnic groups within the population to be served by the applicant.</P>

            <P>(g) A recipient may not take action that is calculated to bring about indirectly what this regulation forbids it to accomplish directly. Thus, a State, in selecting or approving projects or sites for the construction of public libraries which will receive Federal financial assistance, may not base its selections or approvals on criteria which <PRTPAGE P="282"/>have the effect of defeating or of substantially impairing accomplishments of the objectives of the Federal assistance as respects individuals of a particular race, color or national origin.</P>
            <P>(h) In some situations, even though past discriminatory practices attributable to a recipient or applicant have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 100.6(d), to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity and the rights of beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary under the requirement stated in paragraph (i) of § 100.3(b)(6) for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subject to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for obtaining referrals or making selections which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.</P>
            <P>(i) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances, an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.</P>

For example, recipients should have available for the Department racial and ethnic data showing the extent to which members of minority groups are beneficiaries of and participants in federally-assisted programs. In the case in which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.</P>

Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information. Asserted considerations of privacy or confidentiality may not operate to bar the Department from evaluating or seeking to enforce compliance with this part.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this regulation, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, <PRTPAGE P="284"/>and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Noncompliance with § 100.4.</E> If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 100.4 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that the Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.</E> No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible Department official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3) the expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</P>

This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible Department official that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 100.8(c) of this regulation and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as may be filed as the record.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Hearings shall be held at the offices of the Department in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the responsible Department official unless he determines that <PRTPAGE P="285"/>the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the Department requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before a hearing examiner designated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3105 and 3344 (section 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Right to counsel.</E> In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and the Department shall have the right to be represented by counsel.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures, evidence, and record.</E> (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the Department and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing. Any person (other than a Government employee considered to be on official business) who, having been invited or requested to appear and testify as a witness on the Government's behalf, attends at a time and place scheduled for a hearing provided for by this part, may be reimbursed for his travel and actual expenses of attendance in an amount not to exceed the amount payable under the standardized travel regulations to a Government employee traveling on official business.</P>
            <P>(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues.

Where the initial decision referred to in this paragraph or in paragraph (c) of this section is made by the hearing examiner, the applicant or recipient or the counsel for the Department may, within the period provided for in the rules of procedure issued by the responsible Department official, file with the reviewing authority exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. Upon the filing of such exceptions the reviewing authority shall review the initial decision and issue its own decision thereof including the reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions <PRTPAGE P="286"/>the initial decision shall constitute the final decision, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Decisions on record or review by the reviewing authority.</E> Whenever a record is certified to the reviewing authority for decision or it reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with it briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the reviewing authority shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Rulings required.</E> Each decision of a hearing examiner or reviewing authority shall set forth a ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Review in certain cases by the Secretary.</E> If the Secretary has not personally made the final decision referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section, a recipient or applicant or the counsel for the Department may request the Secretary to review a decision of the Reviewing Authority in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Department official. Such review is not a matter of right and shall be granted only where the Secretary determines there are special and important reasons therefor. The Secretary may grant or deny such request, in whole or in part. He may also review such a decision upon his own motion in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Department official. In the absence of a review under this paragraph, a final decision referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) of this section shall become the final decision of the Department when the Secretary transmits it as such to Congressional committees with the report required under section 602 of the Act. Failure of an applicant or recipient to file an exception with the Reviewing Authority or to request review under this paragraph shall not be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose of obtaining judicial review.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of orders.</E> The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this regulation, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended under such law or laws to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this regulation, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this regulation unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Department official that it will fully comply with this regulation.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Post-termination proceedings.</E> (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this part. An elementary or secondary school or school system which is unable to file an assurance of compliance with § 100.3 shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance, if it files a court order or a plan for desegregation which meets the requirements of § 100.4(c), and provides reasonable assurance that it will comply with the court order or plan.</P>

            <P>(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered <PRTPAGE P="287"/>pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible Department official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible Department official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.</P>
            <P>(3) If the responsible Department official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Department official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Responsibilities of All State Agency Recipients</HD>
            <P>State agency recipients, in addition to complying with all other provisions of the Guidelines relevant to them, may not require, approve of, or engage in any discrimination or denial of services on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap in performing any of the following activities:</P>
            <P>1. Establishment of criteria or formulas for distribution of Federal or State funds to vocational education programs in the State;</P>
            <P>2. Establishment of requirements for admission to or requirements for the administration of vocational education programs;</P>
            <P>3. Approval of action by local entities providing vocational education. (For example, a State agency must ensure compliance with Section IV of these Guidelines if and when it reviews a vocational education agency decision to create or change a geographic service area.);</P>
            <P>4. Conducting its own programs. (For example, in employing its staff it may not discriminate on the basis of sex or handicap.)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. State Agencies Performing Oversight Responsibilities</HD>
            <P>The State agency responsible for the administration of vocational education programs must adopt a compliance program to prevent, identify and remedy discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex or handicap by its subrecipients. (A “subrecipient,” in this context, is a local agency or vocational education center that receives financial assistance through a State agency.) This compliance program must include:</P>
            <P>1. Collecting and analyzing civil rights related data and information that subrecipients compile for their own purposes or that are submitted to State and Federal officials under existing authorities;</P>
            <P>2. Conducting periodic compliance reviews of selected subrecipients (i.e., an investigation of a subrecipient to determine whether it engages in unlawful discrimination in any aspect of its program); upon finding unlawful discrimination, notifying the subrecipient of steps it must take to attain compliance and attempting to obtain voluntary compliance;</P>
            <P>3. Providing technical assistance upon request to subrecipients. This will include assisting subrecipients to identify unlawful discrimination and instructing them in remedies for and prevention of such discrimination;</P>
            <P>4. Periodically reporting its activities and findings under the foregoing paragraphs, including findings of unlawful discrimination under paragraph 2, immediately above, to the Office for Civil Rights.</P>
            <P>State agencies are not required to terminate or defer assistance to any subrecipient. Nor are they required to conduct hearings. The responsibilities of the Office for Civil Rights to collect and analyze data, to conduct compliance reviews, to investigate complaints and to provide technical assistance are not diminished or attenuated by the requirements of Section II of the Guidelines.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Distribution of Federal Financial Assistance and Other Funds for Vocational Education</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Agency Responsibilities</HD>
            <P>Recipients that administer grants for vocational education must distribute Federal, State, or local vocational education funds so that no student or group of students is unlawfully denied an equal opportunity to benefit from vocational education on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. Distribution of Funds</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not adopt a formula or other method for the allocation of Federal, State, or local vocational education funds that has the effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. However, a recipient may adopt a formula or other method of allocation that uses as a factor race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap [or an index or proxy for race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap e.g., number of persons receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children or with limited English speaking ability] if the factor is included to compensate for past discrimination or to comply with those provisions of the Vocational Education Amendments of 1976 designed to assist specified protected groups.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">C. Example of a Pattern Suggesting Unlawful Discrimination</HD>
            <P>In each State it is likely that some local recipients will enroll greater proportions of minority students in vocational education than the State-wide proportion of minority students in vocational education. A funding formula or other method of allocation that results in such local recipients receiving per-pupil allocations of Federal or State vocational education funds lower than the State-wide average per-pupil allocation will be presumed unlawfully discriminatory.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">D. Distribution Through Competitive Grants or Contracts</HD>
            <P>Each State agency that establishes criteria for awarding competitive vocational education grants or contracts must establish and apply the criteria without regard to the race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap of any or all of a recipient's students, except to compensate for past discrimination.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">E. Application Processes for Competitive or Discretionary Grants</HD>
            <P>State agencies must disseminate information needed to satisfy the requirements of any application process for competitive or discretionary grants so that all recipients, including those having a high percentage of minority or handicapped students, are informed of and able to seek funds. State agencies that provide technical assistance for the completion of the application process must provide such assistance without discrimination against any one recipient or class of recipients.</P>

            <P>If the Office for Civil Rights finds that a recipient's system for distributing vocational education funds unlawfully discriminates on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap, it will require the recipient to adopt an alternative nondiscriminatory method of distribution. The Office for Civil Rights may also require the recipient to compensate for the effects of its past unlawful discrimination in the distribution of funds.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Access and Admission of Students to Vocational Education Programs</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Recipient Responsibilities</HD>
            <P>Criteria controlling student eligibility for admission to vocational education schools, facilities and programs may not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. A recipient may not develop, impose, maintain, approve, or implement such discriminatory admissions criteria.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. Site Selection for Vocational Schools</HD>
            <P>State and local recipients may not select or approve a site for a vocational education facility for the purpose or with the effect of excluding, segregating, or otherwise discriminating against students on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Recipients must locate vocational education facilities at sites that are readily accessible to both nonminority and minority communities, and that do not tend to identify the facility or program as intended for nonminority or minority students.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">C. Eligibility for Admission to Vocational Education Centers Based on Residence</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not establish, approve or maintain geographic boundaries for a vocational education center service area or attendance zone, (hereinafter “service area”), that unlawfully exclude students on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The Office for Civil Rights will presume, subject to rebuttal, that any one or combination of the following circumstances indicates that the boundaries of a given service area are unlawfully constituted:</P>

            <P>1. A school system or service area contiguous to the given service area, contains minority or nonminority students in substantially greater proportion than the given service area;<PRTPAGE P="294"/>
            </P>
            <P>2. A substantial number of minority students who reside outside the given vocational education center service area, and who are not eligible for the center reside, nonetheless, as close to the center as a substantial number of non-minority students who are eligible for the center;</P>
            <P>3. The over-all vocational education program of the given service area in comparison to the over-all vocational education program of a contiguous school system or service area enrolling a substantially greater proportion of minority students:</P>
            <P>(a) Provides its students with a broader range of curricular offerings, facilities and equipment; or (b) provides its graduates greater opportunity for employment in jobs:</P>
            <P>(i) For which there is a demonstrated need in the community or region; (ii) that pay higher entry level salaries or wages; or (iii) that are generally acknowledged to offer greater prestige or status.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">D. Additions and Renovations to Existing Vocational Education Facilities</HD>
            <P>A recipient may not add to, modify, or renovate the physical plant of a vocational education facility in a manner that creates, maintains, or increases student segregation on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">E. Remedies for Violations of Site Selection and Geographic Service Area Requirements</HD>
            <P>If the conditions specified in paragraphs IV, A, B, C, or D, immediately above, are found and not rebutted by proof of nondiscrimination, the Office for Civil Rights will require the recipient(s) to submit a plan to remedy the discrimination. The following are examples of steps that may be included in the plan, where necessary to overcome the discrimination:</P>
            <P>(1) Redrawing of the boundaries of the vocational education center's service area to include areas unlawfully excluded and/or to exclude areas unlawfully included; (2) provision of transportation to students residing in areas unlawfully excluded; (3) provision of additional programs and services to students who would have been eligible for attendance at the vocational education center but for the discriminatory service area or site selection; (4) reassignment of students; and (5) construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">F. Eligibility for Admission to Secondary Vocational Education Centers Based on Numerical Limits Imposed on Sending Schools</HD>
            <P>A recipient may not adopt or maintain a system for admission to a secondary vocational education center or program that limits admission to a fixed number of students from each sending school included in the center's service area if such a system disproportionately excludes students from the center on the basis of race, sex, national origin or handicap. (Example: Assume 25 percent of a school district's high school students are black and that most of those black students are enrolled in one high school; the white students, 75 percent of the district's total enrollment, are generally enrolled in the five remaining high schools. This paragraph prohibits a system of admission to the secondary vocational education center that limits eligibility to a fixed and equal number of students from each of the district's six high schools.)</P>

            <P>If the Office for Civil Rights finds a violation of paragraph F, above, the recipient must implement an alternative system of admissions that does not disproportionately exclude students on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">H. Eligibility for Admission to Vocational Education Centers, Branches or Annexes Based Upon Student Option</HD>
            <P>A vocational education center, branch or annex, open to all students in a service area and predominantly enrolling minority students or students of one race, national origin or sex, will be presumed unlawfully segregated if:</P>
            <P>(1) It was established by a recipient for members of one race, national origin or sex; or (2) it has since its construction been attended primarily by members of one race, national origin or sex; or (3) most of its program offerings have traditionally been selected predominantly by members of one race, national origin or sex.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Remedies for Facility Segregation Under Student Option Plans</HD>
            <P>If the conditions specified in paragraph IV-H are found and not rebutted by proof of nondiscrimination, the Office for Civil Rights will require the recipient(s) to submit a plan to remedy the segregation. The following are examples of steps that may be included in the plan, where necessary to overcome the discrimination:</P>

            <P>(1) Elimination of program duplication in the segregated facility and other proximate vocational facilities; (2) relocation or “clustering” of programs or courses; (3) adding programs and courses that traditionally have been identified as intended for members of a particular race, national origin or sex to schools that have traditionally served members of the other sex or traditionally served persons of a different race or national origin; (4) merger of programs into one facility through school closings or new construction; <PRTPAGE P="295"/>(5) intensive outreach recruitment and counseling; (6) providing free transportation to students whose enrollment would promote desegregation.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">K. Eligibility Based on Evaluation of Each Applicant Under Admissions Criteria</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not judge candidates for admission to vocational education programs on the basis of criteria that have the effect of disproportionately excluding persons of a particular race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. However, if a recipient can demonstrate that such criteria have been validated as essential to participation in a given program and that alternative equally valid criteria that do not have such a disproportionate adverse effect are unavailable, the criteria will be judged nondiscriminatory. Examples of admissions criteria that must meet this test are past academic performance, record of disciplinary infractions, counselors' approval, teachers' recommendations, interest inventories, high school diplomas and standardized tests, such as the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE).</P>
            <P>An introductory, preliminary, or exploratory course may not be established as a prerequisite for admission to a program unless the course has been and is available without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, and handicap. However, a course that was formerly only available on a discriminatory basis may be made a prerequisite for admission to a program if the recipient can demonstrate that:</P>

            <P>(a) The course is essential to participation in the program; <E T="03">and</E> (b) the course is presently available to those seeking enrollment for the first time and to those formerly excluded.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">L. Eligibility of National Origin Minority Persons With Limited English Language Skills</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not restrict an applicant's admission to vocational education programs because the applicant, as a member of a national origin minority with limited English language skills, cannot participate in and benefit from vocational instruction to the same extent as a student whose primary language is English. It is the responsibility of the recipient to identify such applicants and assess their ability to participate in vocational instruction.</P>
            <P>Acceptable methods of identification include: (1) Identification by administrative staff, teachers, or parents of secondary level students; (2) identification by the student in postsecondary or adult programs; and (3) appropriate diagnostic procedures, if necessary.</P>
            <P>Recipients must take steps to open all vocational programs to these national origin minority students. A recipient must demonstrate that a concentration of students with limited English language skills in one or a few programs is not the result of discriminatory limitations upon the opportunities available to such students.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">M. Remedial Action in Behalf of Persons With Limited English Language Skills</HD>
            <P>If the Office for Civil Rights finds that a recipient has denied national origin minority persons admission to a vocational school or program because of their limited English language skills or has assigned students to vocational programs solely on the basis of their limited English language skills, the recipient will be required to submit a remedial plan that insures national origin minority students equal access to vocational education programs.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">N. Equal Access for Handicapped Students</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not deny handicapped students access to vocational education programs or courses because of architectural or equipment barriers, or because of the need for related aids and services or auxiliary aids. If necessary, recipients must:</P>
            <P>(1) Modify instructional equipment; (2) modify or adapt the manner in which the courses are offered; (3) house the program in facilities that are readily accessible to mobility impaired students or alter facilities to make them readily accessible to mobility impaired students; and (4) provide auxiliary aids that effectively make lectures and necessary materials available to postsecondary handicapped students; (5) provide related aids or services that assure secondary students an appropriate education.</P>
            <P>Academic requirements that the recipient can demonstrate are essential to a program of instruction or to any directly related licensing requirement will not be regarded as discriminatory. However, where possible, a recipient must adjust those requirements to the needs of individual handicapped students.</P>
            <P>Access to vocational programs or courses may not be denied handicapped students on the ground that employment opportunities in any occupation or profession may be more limited for handicapped persons than for non-handicapped persons.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">O. Public Notification</HD>

            <P>Prior to the beginning of each school year, recipients must advise students, parents, employees and the general public that all vocational opportunities will be offered without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. Announcement of this policy of <PRTPAGE P="296"/>non-discrimination may be made, for example, in local newspapers, recipient publications and/or other media that reach the general public, program beneficiaries, minorities (including national origin minorities with limited English language skills), women, and handicapped persons. A brief summary of program offerings and admission criteria should be included in the announcement; also the name, address and telephone number of the person designated to coordinate Title IX and Section 504 compliance activity.</P>
            <P>If a recipient's service area contains a community of national origin minority persons with limited English language skills, public notification materials must be disseminated to that community in its language and must state that recipients will take steps to assure that the lack of English language skills will not be a barrier to admission and participation in vocational education programs.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Counseling and Prevocational Programs</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Recipient Responsibilities</HD>
            <P>Recipients must insure that their counseling materials and activities (including student program selection and career/employment selection), promotional, and recruitment efforts do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. Counseling and Prospects for Success</HD>
            <P>Recipients that operate vocational education programs must insure that counselors do not direct or urge any student to enroll in a particular career or program, or measure or predict a student's prospects for success in any career or program based upon the student's race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. Recipients may not counsel handicapped students toward more restrictive career objectives than nonhandicapped students with similar abilities and interests. If a vocational program disproportionately enrolls male or female students, minority or nonminority students, or handicapped students, recipients must take steps to insure that the disproportion does not result from unlawful discrimination in counseling activities.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">C. Student Recruitment Activities</HD>
            <P>Recipients must conduct their student recruitment activities so as not to exclude or limit opportunities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. Where recruitment activities involve the presentation or portrayal of vocational and career opportunities, the curricula and programs described should cover a broad range of occupational opportunities and not be limited on the basis of the race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap of the students or potential students to whom the presentation is made. Also, to the extent possible, recruiting teams should include persons of different races, national origins, sexes, and handicaps.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">D. Counseling of Students With Limited English-Speaking Ability or Hearing Impairments</HD>
            <P>Recipients must insure that counselors can effectively communicate with national origin minority students with limited English language skills and with students who have hearing impairments. This requirement may be satisfied by having interpreters available.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">E. Promotional Activities</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not undertake promotional efforts (including activities of school officials, counselors, and vocational staff) in a manner that creates or perpetuates stereotypes or limitations based on race, color, national origin, sex or handicap. Examples of promotional efforts are career days, parents' night, shop demonstrations, visitations by groups of prospective students and by representatives from business and industry. Materials that are part of promotional efforts may not create or perpetuate stereotypes through text or illustration. To the extent possible they should portray males or females, minorities or handicapped persons in programs and occupations in which these groups traditionally have not been represented. If a recipient's service area contains a community of national origin minority persons with limited English language skills, promotional literature must be distributed to that community in its language.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Accommodations For Handicapped Students</HD>

            <P>Recipients must place secondary level handicapped students in the regular educational environment of any vocational education program to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the student unless it can be demonstrated that the education of the handicapped person in the regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily. Handicapped students may be placed in a program only after the recipient satisfies the provisions of the Department's Regulation, 34 CFR, part 104, relating to evaluation, placement, and procedural safeguards. If a separate class or facility is identifiable as being for handicapped persons, the facility, the programs, and the services must be comparable to the facilities, programs, and services offered to nonhandicapped students.<PRTPAGE P="297"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. Student Financial Assistance</HD>
            <P>Recipients may not award financial assistance in the form of loans, grants, scholarships, special funds, subsidies, compensation for work, or prizes to vocational education students on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap, except to overcome the effects of past discrimination. Recipients may administer sex restricted financial assistance where the assistance and restriction are established by will, trust, bequest, or any similar legal instrument, if the overall effect of all financial assistance awarded does not discriminate on the basis of sex. Materials and information used to notify students of opportunities for financial assistance may not contain language or examples that would lead applicants to believe the assistance is provided on a discriminatory basis. If a recipient's service area contains a community of national origin minority persons with limited English language skills, such information must be disseminated to that community in its language.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">C. Housing In Residential Postsecondary Vocational Education Centers</HD>
            <P>Recipients must extend housing opportunities without discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. This obligation extends to recipients that provide on-campus housing and/or that have agreements with providers of off-campus housing. In particular, a recipient postsecondary vocational education program that provides on-campus or off-campus housing to its nonhandicapped students must provide, at the same cost and under the same conditions, comparable convenient and accessible housing to handicapped students.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">D. Comparable Facilities</HD>
            <P>Recipients must provide changing rooms, showers, and other facilities for students of one sex that are comparable to those provided to students of the other sex. This may be accomplished by alternating use of the same facilities or by providing separate, comparable facilities.</P>
            <P>Such facilities must be adapted or modified to the extent necessary to make the vocational education program readily accessible to handicapped persons.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Responsibilities in Cooperative Vocational Education Programs, Work-Study Programs, and Job Placement Programs</HD>
            <P>A recipient must insure that: (a) It does not discriminate against its students on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap in making available opportunities in cooperative education, work study and job placement programs; and (b) students participating in cooperative education, work study and job placement programs are not discriminated against by employers or prospective employers on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap in recruitment, hiring, placement, assignment to work tasks, hours of employment, levels of responsibility, and in pay.</P>
            <P>If a recipient enters into a written agreement for the referral or assignment of students to an employer, the agreement must contain an assurance from the employer that students will be accepted and assigned to jobs and otherwise treated without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.</P>
            <P>Recipients may not honor any employer's request for students who are free of handicaps or for students of a particular race, color, national origin, or sex. In the event an employer or prospective employer is or has been subject to court action involving discrimination in employment, school officials should rely on the court's findings if the decision resolves the issue of whether the employer has engaged in unlawful discrimination.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. Apprentice Training Programs</HD>
            <P>A recipient may not enter into any agreement for the provision or support of apprentice training for students or union members with any labor union or other sponsor that discriminates against its members or applicants for membership on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. If a recipient enters into a written agreement with a labor union or other sponsor providing for apprentice training, the agreement must contain an assurance from the union or other sponsor:</P>
            <P>(1) That it does not engage in such discrimination against its membership or applicants for membership; and (2) that apprentice training will be offered and conducted for its membership free of such discrimination.</P>

Every source of faculty must be notified that the recipient does not discriminate in employment on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">C. Patterns Of Discrimination</HD>
            <P>Whenever the Office for Civil Rights finds that in light of the representation of protected groups in the relevant labor market there is a significant underrepresentation or overrepresentation of protected group persons on the staff of a vocational education school or program, it will presume that the disproportion results from unlawful discrimination. This presumption can be overcome by proof that qualified persons of the particular race, color, national origin, or sex, or that qualified handicapped persons are not in fact available in the relevant labor market.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">D. Salary Policies</HD>
            <P>Recipients must establish and maintain faculty salary scales and policy based upon the conditions and responsibilities of employment, without regard to race, color, national origin, sex or handicap.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">E. Employment Opportunities For Handicapped Applicants</HD>
            <P>Recipients must provide equal employment opportunities for teaching and administrative positions to handicapped applicants who can perform the essential functions of the position in question. Recipients must make reasonable accommodation for the physical or mental limitations of handicapped applicants who are otherwise qualified unless recipients can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">F. The Effects Of Past Discrimination</HD>
            <P>Recipients must take steps to overcome the effects of past discrimination in the recruitment, hiring, and assignment of faculty. Such steps may include the recruitment or reassignment of qualified persons of a particular race, national origin, or sex, or who are handicapped.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">G. Staff Of State Advisory Councils Of Vocational Education</HD>
            <P>State Advisory Councils of Vocational Education are recipients of Federal financial assistance and therefore must comply with Section VIII of the Guidelines.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">H. Employment at State Operated Vocational Education Centers Through State Civil-Service Authorities</HD>
            <P>Where recruitment and hiring of staff for State operated vocational education centers is conducted by a State civil service employment authority, the State education agency operating the program must insure that recruitment and hiring of staff for the vocational education center is conducted in accordance with the requirements of these Guidelines.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">IX. Proprietary Vocational Education Schools</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Recipient Responsibilities</HD>
            <P>Proprietary vocational education schools that are recipients of Federal financial assistance through Federal student assistance programs or otherwise are subject to all of the requirements of the Department's regulations and these Guidelines.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. Enforcement Authority</HD>
            <P>Enforcement of the provisions of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is the responsibility of the Department of Education. However, authority to enforce Title VI of the Civil rights Act of 1964 for proprietary vocational education schools has been delegated to the Veterans Administration.</P>
            <P>When the Office for Civil Rights receives a Title VI complaint alleging discrimination by a proprietary vocational education school it will forward the complaint to the Veterans Administration and cite the applicable requirements of the Department's regulations and these Guidelines. The complainant will be notified of such action.</P>

An amicus curiae is not a party and may not introduce evidence at a hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) An amicus curiae may submit a statement of position to the presiding officer prior to the beginning of a hearing, and shall serve a copy on each party.

His brief shall be filed and served on each party within the time limits applicable to the party whose position he deems himself to support; or if he does not deem himself to support the position of any party, within the longest time limit applicable to any party at that particular stage of the proceedings.</P>
              <P>(c) When all parties have completed their initial examination of a witness, any amicus curiae may request the presiding officer to propound specific questions to the witness.

              <P>(a) If any party desires to argue a case orally on exceptions or replies to exceptions to an initial or recommended decision, he shall make such request in writing. The reviewing authority may grant or deny such requests in its discretion. If granted, it will serve notice of oral argument on all parties. The notice will set forth the order of presentation, the amount of time allotted, and the time and place for argument. The names of persons who will argue should be filed with the Department hearing clerk not later than 7 days before the date set for oral argument.</P>
              <P>(b) The purpose of oral argument is to emphasize and clarify the written argument in the briefs. Reading at length from the brief or other texts is not favored. Participants should confine their arguments to points of controlling importance and to points upon which exceptions have been filed. Consolidations of appearances at oral argument by parties taking the same side will permit the parties' interests to be presented more effectively in the time allotted.</P>
              <P>(c) Pamphlets, charts, and other written material may be presented at oral argument only if such material is limited to facts already in the record and is served on all parties and filed with the Department hearing clerk at least 7 days before the argument.</P>

Such request shall be in writing and shall affirmatively show that since entry of the order, it has brought its program or activity into compliance with the requirements of the Act, and with the Regulation thereunder, and shall set forth specifically, and in detail, the steps which it has taken to achieve such compliance. If the responsible Department official denies such request the applicant or recipient shall be given an expeditious hearing if it so requests in writing and specifies why it <PRTPAGE P="309"/>believes the responsible Department official to have been in error. The request for such a hearing shall be addressed to the responsible Department official and shall be made within 30 days after the applicant or recipient is informed that the responsible Department official has refused to authorize payment or permit resumption of Federal financial assistance.</P>

              <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
              <P>(1) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of handicap, and</P>

This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> A recipient may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of health, welfare, or other social services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the requirements of § 104.23, or any other methods that result in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>

The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped persons;</P>
              <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>

              <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve full accessibility in order to comply with paagraph (a) of this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is <PRTPAGE P="318"/>longer than one year, identify the steps of that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education program or activity shall provide a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's jurisdiction, regardless of the nature or severity of the person's handicap.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Appropriate education.</E> (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the provision <PRTPAGE P="319"/>of an appropriate education is the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii) are based upon adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of §§ 104.34, 104.35, and 104.36.</P>
              <P>(2) Implementation of an Individualized Education Program developed in accordance with the Education of the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting the standard established in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) A recipient may place a handicapped person or refer such a person for aid, benefits, or services other than those that it operates or provides as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart. If so, the recipient remains responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this subpart are met with respect to any handicapped person so placed or referred.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Free education</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> For the purpose of this section, the provision of a free education is the provision of educational and related services without cost to the handicapped person or to his or her parents or guardian, except for those fees that are imposed on non-handicapped persons or their parents or guardian. It may consist either of the provision of free services or, if a recipient places a handicapped person or refers such person for aid, benefits, or services not operated or provided by the recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, of payment for the costs of the aid, benefits, or services. Funds available from any public or private agency may be used to meet the requirements of this subpart. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve an insurer or similar third party from an otherwise valid obligation to provide or pay for services provided to a handicapped person.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Transportation.</E> If a recipient places a handicapped person or refers such person for aid, benefits, or services not operated or provided by the recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, the recipient shall ensure that adequate transportation to and from the aid, benefits, or services is provided at no greater cost than would be incurred by the person or his or her parents or guardian if the person were placed in the aid, benefits, or services operated by the recipient.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Residential placement.</E> If a public or private residential placement is necessary to provide a free appropriate public education to a handicapped person because of his or her handicap, the placement, including non-medical care and room and board, shall be provided at no cost to the person or his or her parents or guardian.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Placement of handicapped persons by parents.</E> If a recipient has made available, in conformance with the requirements of this section and § 104.34, a free appropriate public education to a handicapped person and the person's parents or guardian choose to place the person in a private school, the recipient is not required to pay for the person's education in the private school. Disagreements between a parent or guardian and a recipient regarding whether the recipient has made a free appropriate public education available or otherwise regarding the question of financial responsibility are subject to the due process procedures of § 104.36.</P>

              <P>(1) Tests and other evaluation materials have been validated for the specific purpose for which they are used and are administered by trained personnel in conformance with the instructions provided by their producer;</P>
              <P>(2) Tests and other evaluation materials include those tailored to assess specific areas of educational need and not merely those which are designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient; and</P>
              <P>(3) Tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to a student with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the student's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Placement procedures.</E> In interpreting evaluation data and in making placement decisions, a recipient shall (1) draw upon information from a variety of sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, teacher recommendations, physical condition, social or cultural background, and adaptive behavior, (2) establish procedures to ensure that information obtained from all such sources is documented and carefully considered, (3) ensure that the placement decision is made by a group of persons, including persons knowledgeable about the child, the meaning of the evaluation data, and the placement options, and (4) ensure that the placement decision is made in conformity with § 104.34.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reevaluation.</E> A recipient to which this section applies shall establish procedures, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, for periodic reevaluation of students who have been provided special education and related services. A reevaluation procedure consistent with the Education for the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting this requirement.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Qualified handicapped persons may not, on the basis of handicap, be denied admission or be subjected to discrimination in admission or recruitment by a recipient to which this subpart applies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Admissions.</E> In administering its admission policies, a recipient to which this subpart applies:</P>
              <P>(1) May not apply limitations upon the number or proportion of handicapped persons who may be admitted;</P>
              <P>(2) May not make use of any test or criterion for admission that has a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons or any class of handicapped persons unless (i) the test or criterion, as used by the recipient, has been validated as a predictor of success in the education program or activity in question and (ii) alternate tests or criteria that have a less disproportionate, adverse effect are not shown by the Assistant Secretary to be available.</P>
              <P>(3) Shall assure itself that (i) admissions tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to an applicant who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure); (ii) admissions tests that are designed for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills are offered as often and in as timely a manner as are other admissions tests; and (iii) admissions tests are administered in facilities that, on the whole, are accessible to handicapped persons; and</P>
              <P>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may not make preadmission inquiry as to whether an applicant for admission is a handicapped person but, after admission, may make inquiries on a confidential basis as to handicaps that may require accommodation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Preadmission inquiry exception.</E> When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant to § 104.6(a) or when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to § 104.6(b), the recipient may invite applicants for admission to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped, <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
              <P>(1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary action efforts; and</P>
              <P>(2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Validity studies.</E> For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a recipient may base prediction equations on first year grades, but shall conduct periodic validity studies against the criterion of overall success in the education program or activity in question in order to monitor the general validity of the test scores.</P>

Academic requirements that the recipient can demonstrate are essential to the instruction being pursued by such student or to any directly related licensing requirement will not be regarded as discriminatory within the meaning of this section. Modifications may include changes in the length of time permitted for the completion of degree requirements, substitution of specific courses required for the completion of degree requirements, and adaptation of the manner in which specific courses are conducted.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Auxiliary aids.</E> (1) A recipient to which this subpart applies shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that no handicapped student is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination because of the absence of educational auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.</P>
              <P>(2) Auxiliary aids may include taped texts, interpreters or other effective methods of making orally delivered materials available to students with hearing impairments, readers in libraries for students with visual impairments, classroom equipment adapted for use by students with manual impairments, and other similar services and actions. Recipients need not provide attendants, individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services of a personal nature.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Definitions</E>—1. <E T="03">Recipient.</E> Section 104.23 contains definitions used throughout the regulation.</P>
              <P>One comment requested that the regulation specify that nonpublic elementary and secondary schools that are not otherwise recipients do not become recipients by virtue of the fact their students participate in certain federally funded programs. The Secretary believes it unnecessary to amend the regulation in this regard, because almost identical language in the Department's regulations implementing title VI and title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 has consistently been interpreted so as not to render such schools recipients. These schools, however, are indirectly subject to the substantive requirements of this regulation through the application of § 104.4(b)(iv), which prohibits recipients from assisting agencies that discriminate on the basis of handicap in providing services to beneficiaries of the recipients' programs.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Federal financial assistance.</E> In § 104.3(h), defining federal financial assistance, a clarifying change has been made: procurement contracts are specifically excluded. They are covered, however, by the Department of Labor's regulation under section 503. The Department has never considered such contracts to be contracts of assistance; the explicit exemption has been added only to avoid possible confusion.</P>
              <P>The proposed regulation's exemption of contracts of insurance or guaranty has been retained. A number of comments argued for its deletion on the ground that section 504, unlike title VI and title IX, contains no statutory exemption for such contracts. There is no indication, however, in the legislative history of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or of the amendments to that Act in 1974, that Congress intended section 504 to have a broader application, in terms of federal financial assistance, than other civil rights statutes. Indeed, Congress directed that section 504 be implemented in the same manner as titles VI and IX. In view of the long established exemption of contracts of insurance or guaranty under title VI, we think it unlikely that Congress intended section 504 to apply to such contracts.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Handicapped person.</E> Section 104.3(j), which defines the class of persons protected under the regulation, has not been substantially changed. The definition of handicapped person in paragraph (j)(1) conforms to the statutory definition of handicapped person that is applicable to section 504, as set forth in section 111(a) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93-516.</P>
              <P>The first of the three parts of the statutory and regulatory definition includes any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Paragraph (j)(2)(i) further defines physical or mental impairments. The definition does not set forth a list of specific diseases and conditions that constitute physical or mental impairments because of the difficulty of ensuring the comprehensiveness of any such list. The term includes, however, such diseases and conditions as orthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, intellectual disability, emotional illness, and, as discussed below, drug addiction and alcoholism.</P>
              <P>It should be emphasized that a physical or mental impairment does not constitute a handicap for purposes of section 504 unless its severity is such that it results in a substantial limitation of one or more major life activities. Several comments observed the lack of any definition in the proposed regulation of the phrase “substantially limits.” The Department does not believe that a definition of this term is possible at this time.</P>
              <P>A related issue raised by several comments is whether the definition of handicapped person is unreasonably broad. Comments suggested narrowing the definition in various ways. The most common recommendation was that only “traditional” handicaps be covered. The Department continues to believe, however, that it has no flexibility within the statutory definition to limit the term to persons who have those severe, permanent, or progressive conditions that are most commonly regarded as handicaps. The Department intends, however, to give particular attention in its enforcement of section 504 to eliminating discrimination against persons with the severe handicaps that were the focus of concern in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</P>
              <P>The definition of handicapped person also includes specific limitations on what persons are classified as handicapped under the regulation. The first of the three parts of the definition specifies that only physical and mental handicaps are included. Thus, environmental, cultural, and economic disadvantage are not in themselves covered; nor are prison records, age, or homosexuality. Of course, if a person who has any of these characteristics also has a physical or mental handicap, the person is included within the definition of handicapped person.</P>

              <P>In paragraph (j)(2)(i), physical or mental impairment is defined to include, among other impairments, specific learning disabilities. The Department will interpret the term as it is used in section 602 of the Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended. <PRTPAGE P="327"/>Paragraph (15) of section 602 uses the term “specific learning disabilities” to describe such conditions as perceptual handicaps, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (j)(2)(i) has been shortened, but not substantively changed, by the deletion of clause (C), which made explicit the inclusion of any condition which is mental or physical but whose precise nature is not at present known. Clauses (A) and (B) clearly comprehend such conditions.</P>
              <P>The second part of the statutory and regulatory definition of handicapped person includes any person who has a record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Under the definition of “record” in paragraph (j)(2)(iii), persons who have a history of a handicapping condition but no longer have the condition, as well as persons who have been incorrectly classified as having such a condition, are protected from discrimination under section 504. Frequently occurring examples of the first group are persons with histories of mental or emotional illness, heart disease, or cancer; of the second group, persons who have been misclassified as having an intellectual disability.</P>
              <P>The third part of the statutory and regulatory definition of handicapped person includes any person who is regarded as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. It includes many persons who are ordinarily considered to be handicapped but who do not technically fall within the first two parts of the statutory definition, such as persons with a limp. This part of the definition also includes some persons who might not ordinarily be considered handicapped, such as persons with disfiguring scars, as well as persons who have no physical or mental impairment but are treated by a recipient as if they were handicapped.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Drug addicts and alcoholics.</E> As was the case during the first comment period, the issue of whether to include drug addicts and alcoholics within the definition of handicapped person was of major concern to many commenters. The arguments presented on each side of the issue were similar during the two comment periods, as was the preference of commenters for exclusion of this group of persons. While some comments reflected misconceptions about the implications of including alcoholics and drug addicts within the scope of the regulation, the Secretary understands the concerns that underlie the comments on this question and recognizes that application of section 504 to active alcoholics and drug addicts presents sensitive and difficult questions that must be taken into account in interpretation and enforcement.</P>
              <P>The Secretary has carefully examined the issue and has obtained a legal opinion from the Attorney General. That opinion concludes that drug addiction and alcoholism are “physical or mental impairments” within the meaning of section 7(6) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and that drug addicts and alcoholics are therefore handicapped for purposes of section 504 if their impairment substantially limits one of their major life activities. The Secretary therefore believes that he is without authority to exclude these conditions from the definition. There is a medical and legal consensus that alcoholism and drug addiction are diseases, although there is disagreement as to whether they are primarily mental or physical. In addition, while Congress did not focus specifically on the problems of drug addiction and alcoholism in enacting section 504, the committees that considered the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 were made aware of the Department's long-standing practice of treating addicts and alcoholics as handicapped individuals eligible for rehabilitation services under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act.</P>
              <P>The Secretary wishes to reassure recipients that inclusion of addicts and alcoholics within the scope of the regulation will not lead to the consequences feared by many commenters. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the statute and the regulation apply only to discrimination against qualified handicapped persons solely by reason of their handicap. The fact that drug addiction and alcoholism may be handicaps does not mean that these conditions must be ignored in determining whether an individual is qualified for services or employment opportunities. On the contrary, a recipient may hold a drug addict or alcoholic to the same standard of performance and behavior to which it holds others, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the person's drug addiction or alcoholism. In other words, while an alcoholic or drug addict may not be denied services or disqualified from employment solely because of his or her condition, the behavioral manifestations of the condition may be taken into account in determining whether he or she is qualified.</P>

              <P>With respect to the employment of a drug addict or alcoholic, if it can be shown that the addiction or alcoholism prevents successful performance of the job, the person need not be provided the employment opportunity in question. For example, in making employment decisions, a recipient may judge addicts and alcoholics on the same basis it judges all other applicants and employees. Thus, a recipient may consider—for all applicants including drug addicts and alcoholics—past personnel records, absenteeism, disruptive, abusive, or dangerous behavior, violations of rules and unsatisfactory work performance. Moreover, employers may enforce <PRTPAGE P="328"/>rules prohibiting the possession or use of alcohol or drugs in the work-place, provided that such rules are enforced against all employees.</P>
              <P>With respect to other services, the implications of coverage, of alcoholics and drug addicts are two-fold: first, no person may be excluded from services solely by reason of the presence or history of these conditions; second, to the extent that the manifestations of the condition prevent the person from meeting the basic eligibility requirements of the program or cause substantial interference with the operation of the program, the condition may be taken into consideration. Thus, a college may not exclude an addict or alcoholic as a student, on the basis of addiction or alcoholism, if the person can successfully participate in the education program and complies with the rules of the college and if his or her behavior does not impede the performance of other students.</P>
              <P>Of great concern to many commenters was the question of what effect the inclusion of drug addicts and alcoholics as handicapped persons would have on school disciplinary rules prohibiting the use or possession of drugs or alcohol by students. Neither such rules nor their application to drug addicts or alcoholics is prohibited by this regulation, provided that the rules are enforced evenly with respect to all students.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Qualified handicapped person.</E> Paragraph (k) of § 104.3 defines the term “qualified handicapped person.” Throughout the regulation, this term is used instead of the statutory term “otherwise qualified handicapped person.” The Department believes that the omission of the word “otherwise” is necessary in order to comport with the intent of the statute because, read literally, “otherwise” qualified handicapped persons include persons who are qualified except for their handicap, rather than in spite of their handicap. Under such a literal reading, a blind person possessing all the qualifications for driving a bus except sight could be said to be “otherwise qualified” for the job of driving. Clearly, such a result was not intended by Congress. In all other respects, the terms “qualified” and “otherwise qualified” are intended to be interchangeable.</P>
              <P>Section 104.3(k)(1) defines a qualified handicapped person with respect to employment as a handicapped person who can, with reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of the job in question. The term “essential functions” does not appear in the corresponding provision of the Department of Labor's section 503 regulation, and a few commenters objected to its inclusion on the ground that a handicapped person should be able to perform all job tasks. However, the Department believes that inclusion of the phrase is useful in emphasizing that handicapped persons should not be disqualified simply because they may have difficulty in performing tasks that bear only a marginal relationship to a particular job. Further, we are convinced that inclusion of the phrase is not inconsistent with the Department of Labor's application of its definition.</P>
              <P>Certain commenters urged that the definition of qualified handicapped person be amended so as explicitly to place upon the employer the burden of showing that a particular mental or physical characteristic is essential. Because the same result is achieved by the requirement contained in paragraph (a) of § 104.13, which requires an employer to establish that any selection criterion that tends to screen out handicapped persons is job-related, that recommendation has not been followed.</P>
              <P>Section 104.3(k)(2) defines qualified handicapped person, with respect to preschool, elementary, and secondary programs, in terms of age. Several commenters recommended that eligibility for the services be based upon the standard of substantial benefit, rather than age, because of the need of many handicapped children for early or extended services if they are to have an equal opportunity to benefit from education programs. No change has been made in this provision, again because of the extreme difficulties in administration that would result from the choice of the former standard. Under the remedial action provisions of § 104.6(a)(3), however, persons beyond the age limits prescribed in § 104.3(k)(2) may in appropriate cases be required to be provided services that they were formerly denied because of a recipient's violation of section 504.</P>
              <P>Section 104.3(k)(2) states that a handicapped person is qualified for preschool, elementary, or secondary services if the person is of an age at which nonhandicapped persons are eligible for such services or at which State law mandates the provision of educational services to handicapped persons. In addition, the extended age ranges for which recipients must provide full educational opportunity to all handicapped persons in order to be eligible for assistance under the Education of the Handicapped Act—generally, 3-18 as of September 1978, and 3-21 as of September 1980 are incorporated by reference in this paragraph.</P>

              <P>Section 104.3(k)(3) defines qualified handicapped person with respect to postsecondary educational programs. As revised, the paragraph means that both academic and technical standards must be met by applicants to these programs. The term <E T="03">technical standards</E> refers to all nonacademic admissions criteria that are essential to participation in the program in question.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">General prohibitions against discrimination.</E> Section 104.4 contains general prohibitions against discrimination applicable to all recipients of assistance from this Department.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (b)(1(i) prohibits the exclusion of qualified handicapped persons from aids, <PRTPAGE P="329"/>benefits, or services, and paragraph (ii) requires that equal opportunity to participate or benefit be provided. Paragraph (iii) requires that services provided to handicapped persons be as effective as those provided to the nonhandicapped. In paragraph (iv), different or separate services are prohibited except when necessary to provide equally effective benefits.</P>
              <P>In this context, the term <E T="03">equally effective,</E> defined in paragraph (b)(2), is intended to encompass the concept of equivalent, as opposed to identical, services and to acknowledge the fact that in order to meet the individual needs of handicapped persons to the same extent that the corresponding needs of nonhandicapped persons are met, adjustments to regular programs or the provision of different programs may sometimes be necessary. This standard parallels the one established under title VI of Civil Rights Act of 1964 with respect to the provision of educational services to students whose primary language is not English. See <E T="03">Lau</E> v. <E T="03">Nichols,</E> 414 U.S. 563 (1974). To be equally effective, however, an aid, benefit, or service need not produce equal results; it merely must afford an equal opportunity to achieve equal results.</P>
              <P>It must be emphasized that, although separate services must be required in some instances, the provision of unnecessarily separate or different services is discriminatory. The addition to paragraph (b)(2) of the phrase “in the most integrated setting appropriated to the person's needs” is intended to reinforce this general concept. A new paragraph (b)(3) has also been added to § 104.4, requiring recipients to give qualified handicapped persons the option of participating in regular programs despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs. The requirement has been reiterated in §§ 104.38 and 104.47 in connection with physical education and athletics programs.</P>
              <P>Section 104.4(b)(1)(v) prohibits a recipient from supporting another entity or person that subjects participants or employees in the recipient's program to discrimination on the basis of handicap. This section would, for example, prohibit financial support by a recipient to a community recreational group or to a professional or social organization that discriminates against handicapped persons. Among the criteria to be considered in each case are the substantiality of the relationship between the recipient and the other entity, including financial support by the recipient, and whether the other entity's activities relate so closely to the recipient's program or activity that they fairly should be considered activities of the recipient itself. Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) was added in response to comment in order to make explicit the prohibition against denying qualified handicapped persons the opportunity to serve on planning and advisory boards responsible for guiding federally assisted programs or activities.</P>
              <P>Several comments appeared to interpret § 104.4(b)(5), which proscribes discriminatory site selection, to prohibit a recipient that is located on hilly terrain from erecting any new buildings at its present site. That, of course, is not the case. This paragraph is not intended to apply to construction of additional buildings at an existing site. Of course, any such facilities must be made accessible in accordance with the requirements of § 104.23.</P>
              <P>7. <E T="03">Assurances of compliance.</E> Section 104.5(a) requires a recipient to submit to the Assistant Secretary an assurance that each of its programs and activities receiving or benefiting from Federal financial assistance from this Department will be conducted in compliance with this regulation. Many commenters also sought relief from the paperwork requirements imposed by the Department's enforcement of its various civil rights responsibilities by requesting the Department to issue one form incorporating title VI, title IX, and section 504 assurances. The Secretary is sympathetic to this request. While it is not feasible to adopt a single civil rights assurance form at this time, the Office for Civil Rights will work toward that goal.</P>
              <P>8. <E T="03">Private rights of action.</E> Several comments urged that the regulation incorporate provision granting beneficiaries a private right of action against recipients under section 504. To confer such a right is beyond the authority of the executive branch of Government. There is, however, case law holding that such a right exists. <E T="03">Lloyd</E> v. <E T="03">Regional Transportation Authority,</E> 548 F. 2d 1277 (7th Cir. 1977); <E T="03">see Hairston</E> v. <E T="03">Drosick,</E> Civil No. 75-0691 (S.D. W. Va., Jan. 14, 1976); <E T="03">Gurmankin</E> v. <E T="03">Castanzo,</E> 411 F. Supp. 982 (E.D. Pa. 1976); <E T="03">cf. Lau</E> v. <E T="03">Nichols, supra.</E>
              </P>
              <P>9. <E T="03">Remedial action.</E> Where there has been a finding of discrimination, § 104.6 requires a recipient to take remedial action to overcome the effects of the discrimination. Actions that might be required under paragraph (a)(1) include provision of services to persons previously discriminated against, reinstatement of employees and development of a remedial action plan. Should a recipient fail to take required remedial action, the ultimate sanctions of court action or termination of Federal financial assistance may be imposed.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (a)(2) extends the responsibility for taking remedial action to a recipient that exercises control over a noncomplying recipient. Paragraph (a)(3) also makes clear that handicapped persons who are not in the program at the time that remedial action is required to be taken may also be the subject of such remedial action. This paragraph has been revised in response to comments in order to include persons who would have <PRTPAGE P="330"/>been in the program if discriminatory practices had not existed. Paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) have also been amended in response to comments to make plain that, in appropriate cases, remedial action might be required to redress clear violations of the statute itself that occurred before the effective date of this regulation.</P>
              <P>10. <E T="03">Voluntary action.</E> In § 104.6(b), the term “voluntary action” has been substituted for the term “affirmative action” because the use of the latter term led to some confusion. We believe the term “voluntary action” more accurately reflects the purpose of the paragraph. This provision allows action, beyond that required by the regulation, to overcome conditions that led to limited participation by handicapped persons, whether or not the limited participation was caused by any discriminatory actions on the part of the recipient. Several commenters urged that paragraphs (a) and (b) be revised to require remedial action to overcome effects of prior discriminatory practices regardless of whether there has been an express finding of discrimination. The self-evaluation requirement in paragraph (c) accomplishes much the same purpose.</P>
              <P>11. <E T="03">Self-evaluation.</E> Paragraph (c) requires recipients to conduct a self-evaluation in order to determine whether their policies or practices may discriminate against handicapped persons and to take steps to modify any discriminatory policies and practices and their effects. The Department received many comments approving of the addition to paragraph (c) of a requirement that recipients seek the assistance of handicapped persons in the self-evaluation process. This paragraph has been further amended to require consultation with handicapped persons or organizations representing them before recipients undertake the policy modifications and remedial steps prescribed in paragraphs (c) (ii) and (iii).</P>
              <P>Paragraph (c)(2), which sets forth the recordkeeping requirements concerning self-evaluation, now applies only to recipients with fifteen or more employees. This change was made as part of an effort to reduce unnecessary or counterproductive administrative obligations on small recipients. For those recipients required to keep records, the requirements have been made more specific; records must include a list of persons consulted and a description of areas examined, problems identified, and corrective steps taken. Moreover, the records must be made available for public inspection.</P>
              <P>12. <E T="03">Grievance procedure.</E> Section 104.7 requires recipients with fifteen or more employees to designate an individual responsible for coordinating its compliance efforts and to adopt a grievance procedure. Two changes were made in the section in response to comment. A general requirement that appropriate due process procedures be followed has been added. It was decided that the details of such procedures could not at this time be specified because of the varied nature of the persons and entities who must establish the procedures and of the programs to which they apply. A sentence was also added to make clear that grievance procedures are not required to be made available to unsuccessful applicants for employment or to applicants for admission to colleges and universities.</P>
              <P>The regulation does not require that grievance procedures be exhausted before recourse is sought from the Department. However, the Secretary believes that it is desirable and efficient in many cases for complainants to seek resolution of their complaints and disputes at the local level and therefore encourages them to use available grievance procedures.</P>
              <P>A number of comments asked whether compliance with this section or the notice requirements of § 104.8 could be coordinated with comparable action required by the title IX regulation. The Department encourages such efforts.</P>
              <P>13. <E T="03">Notice.</E> Section 104.8 (formerly § 84.9) sets forth requirements for dissemination of statements of nondicrimination policy by recipients.</P>
              <P>It is important that both handicapped persons and the public at large be aware of the obligations of recipients under section 504. Both the Department and recipients have responsibilities in this regard. Indeed the Department intends to undertake a major public information effort to inform persons of their rights under section 504 and this regulation. In § 104.8 the Department has sought to impose a clear obligation on major recipients to notify beneficiaries and employees of the requirements of section 504, without dictating the precise way in which this notice must be given. At the same time, we have avoided imposing requirements on small recipients (those with fewer than fifteen employees) that would create unnecessary and counterproductive paper work burdens on them and unduly stretch the enforcement resources of the Department.</P>
              <P>Section 104.8(a), as simplified, requires recipients with fifteen or more employees to take appropriate steps to notify beneficiaries and employees of the recipient's obligations under section 504. The last sentence of § 104.8(a) has been revised to list possible, rather than required, means of notification. Section 104.8(b) requires recipients to include a notification of their policy of nondiscrimination in recruitment and other general information materials.</P>

              <P>In response to a number of comments, § 104.8 has been revised to delete the requirements of publication in local newspapers, which has proved to be both troublesome and ineffective. Several commenters suggested <PRTPAGE P="331"/>that notification on separate forms be allowed until present stocks of publications and forms are depleted. The final regulation explicitly allows this method of compliance. The separate form should, however, be included with each significant publication or form that is distributed.</P>
              <P>Section 104 which prohibited the use of materials that might give the impression that a recipient excludes qualified handicapped persons from its program, has been deleted. The Department is convinced by the comments that this provision is unnecessary and difficult to apply. The Department encourages recipients, however, to include in their recruitment and other general information materials photographs of handicapped persons and ramps and other features of accessible buildings.</P>
              <P>Under new § 104.9 the Assistant Secretary may, under certain circumstances, require recipients with fewer than fifteen employees to comply with one or more of these requirements. Thus, if experience shows a need for imposing notice or other requirements on particular recipients or classes of small recipients, the Department is prepared to expand the coverage of these sections.</P>
              <P>14. <E T="03">Inconsistent State laws.</E> Section 104.10(a) states that compliance with the regulation is not excused by State or local laws limiting the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons to receive services or to practice an occupation. The provision thus applies only with respect to state or local laws that unjustifiably differentiate on the basis of handicap.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b) further points out that the presence of limited employment opportunities in a particular profession, does not excuse a recipient from complying with the regulation. Thus, a law school could not deny admission to a blind applicant because blind laywers may find it more difficult to find jobs than do nonhandicapped lawyers.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart B—Employment Practices</HD>
              <P>Subpart B prescribes requirements for nondiscrimination in the employment practices of recipients of Federal financial assistance administered by the Department. This subpart is consistent with the employment provisions of the Department's regulation implementing title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (34 CFR, part 106) and the regulation of the Department of Labor under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, which requries certain Federal contractors to take affirmative action in the employment and advancement of qualified handicapped persons. All recipients subject to title IX are also subject to this regulation. In addition, many recipients subject to this regulation receive Federal procurement contracts in excess of $2,500 and are therefore also subject to section 503.</P>
              <P>15. <E T="03">Discriminatory practices.</E> Section 104.11 sets forth general provisions with respect to discrimination in employment. A new paragraph (a)(2) has been added to clarify the employment obligations of recipients that receive Federal funds under Part B of the Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended (EHA). Section 606 of the EHA obligates elementary or secondary school systems that receive EHA funds to take positive steps to employ and advance in employment qualified handicapped persons. This obligation is similar to the nondiscrimination requirement of section 504 but requires recipients to take additional steps to hire and promote handicapped persons. In enacting section 606 Congress chose the words “positive steps” instead of “affirmative action” advisedly and did not intend section 606 to incorporate the types of activities required under Executive Order 11246 (affirmative action on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin) or under sections 501 and 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b) of § 104.11 sets forth the specific aspects of employment covered by the regulation. Paragraph (c) provides that inconsistent provisions of collective bargaining agreements do not excuse noncompliance.</P>
              <P>16. <E T="03">Reasonable accommodation.</E> The reasonable accommodation requirement of § 104.12 generated a substantial number of comments. The Department remains convinced that its approach is both fair and effective. Moreover, the Department of Labor reports that it has experienced little difficulty in administering the requirements of reasonable accommodation. The provision therefore remains basically unchanged from the proposed regulation.</P>
              <P>Section 104.12 requires a recipient to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of a handicapped applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. Where a handicapped person is not qualified to perform a particular job, where reasonable accommodation does not overcome the effects of a person's handicap, or where reasonable accommodation causes undue hardship to the employer, failure to hire or promote the handicapped person will not be considered discrimination.</P>
              <P>Section 104.12(b) lists some of the actions that constitute reasonable accommodation. The list is neither all-inclusive nor meant to suggest that employers must follow all of the actions listed.</P>

              <P>Reasonable accommodation includes modification of work schedules, including part-time employment, and job restructuring. Job restructuring may entail shifting nonessential duties to other employees. In other <PRTPAGE P="332"/>cases, reasonable accommodation may include physical modifications or relocation of particular offices or jobs so that they are in facilities or parts of facilities that are accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. If such accommodations would cause undue hardship to the employer, they need not be made.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (c) of this section sets forth the factors that the Office for Civil Rights will consider in determining whether an accommodation necessary to enable an applicant or employee to perform the duties of a job would impose an undue hardship. The weight given to each of these factors in making the determination as to whether an accommodation constitutes undue hardship will vary depending on the facts of a particular situation. Thus, a small day-care center might not be required to expend more than a nominal sum, such as that necessary to equip a telephone for use by a secretary with impaired hearing, but a large school district might be required to make available a teacher's aide to a blind applicant for a teaching job. The reasonable accommodation standard in § 104.12 is similar to the obligation imposed upon Federal contractors in the regulation implementing section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, administered by the Department of Labor. Although the wording of the reasonable accommodation provisions of the two regulations is not identical, the obligation that the two regulations impose is the same, and the Federal Government's policy in implementing the two sections will be uniform. The Department adopted the factors listed in paragraph (c) instead of the “business necessity” standard of the Labor regulation because that term seemed inappropriate to the nature of the programs operated by the majority of institutions subject to this regulation, e.g., public school systems, colleges and universities. The factors listed in paragraph (c) are intended to make the rationale underlying the business necessity standard applicable to an understandable by recipients of ED funds.</P>
              <P>17. <E T="03">Tests and selection criteria.</E> Revised § 104.13(a) prohibits employers from using test or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out handicapped persons unless the test or criterion is shown to be job-related and alternative tests or criteria that do not screen out or tend to screen out as many handicapped persons are not shown by the Assistant Secretary to be available. This paragraph is an application of the principle established under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in <E T="03">Griggs</E> v. <E T="03">Duke Power Company,</E> 401 U.S. 424 (1971).</P>
              <P>Under the proposed section, a statistical showing of adverse impact on handicapped persons was required to trigger an employer's obligation to show that employment criteria and qualifications relating to handicap were necessary. This requirement was changed because the small number of handicapped persons taking tests would make statistical showings of “disproportionate, adverse effect” difficult and burdensome. Under the altered, more workable provision, once it is shown that an employment test substantially limits the opportunities of handicapped persons, the employer must show the test to be job-related. A recipient is no longer limited to using predictive validity studies as the method for demonstrating that a test or other selection criterion is in fact job-related. Nor, in all cases, are predictive validity studies sufficient to demonstrate that a test or criterion is job-related. In addition, § 104.13(a) has been revised to place the burden on the Assistant Secretary, rather than the recipient, to identify alternate tests.</P>
              <P>Section 104.13(b) requires that a recipient take into account that some tests and criteria depend upon sensory, manual, or speaking skills that may not themselves be necessary to the job in question but that may make the handicapped person unable to pass the test. The recipient must select and administer tests so as best to ensure that the test will measure the handicapped person's ability to perform on the job rather than the person's ability to see, hear, speak, or perform manual tasks, except, of course, where such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure. For example, a person with a speech impediment may be perfectly qualified for jobs that do not or need not, with reasonable accommodation, require ability to speak clearly. Yet, if given an oral test, the person will be unable to perform in a satisfactory manner. The test results will not, therefore, predict job performance but instead will reflect impaired speech.</P>
              <P>18. <E T="03">Preemployment inquiries.</E> Section 104.14, concerning preemployment inquiries, generated a large number of comments. Commenters representing handicapped persons strongly favored a ban on preemployment inquiries on the ground that such inquiries are often used to discriminate against handicapped persons and are not necessary to serve any legitimate interests of employers. Some recipients, on the other hand, argued that preemployment inquiries are necessary to determine qualifications of the applicant, safety hazards caused by a particular handicapping condition, and accommodations that might be required.</P>

              <P>The Secretary has concluded that a general prohibition of preemployment inquiries is appropriate. However, a sentence has been added to paragraph (a) to make clear that an employer may inquire into an applicant's ability to perform job-related tasks but may not ask if the person has a handicap. For example, an employer may not ask on an employment form if an applicant is visually impaired but may ask if the person has a current driver's license (if that is a necessary <PRTPAGE P="333"/>qualification for the position in question). Similarly, employers may make inquiries about an applicant's ability to perform a job safely. Thus, an employer may not ask if an applicant is an epileptic but may ask whether the person can perform a particular job without endangering other employees.</P>
              <P>Section 104.14(b) allows preemployment inquiries only if they are made in conjunction with required remedial action to correct past discrimination, with voluntary action to overcome past conditions that have limited the participation of handicapped persons, or with obligations under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In these instances, paragraph (b) specifies certain safeguards that must be followed by the employer.</P>
              <P>Finally, the revised provision allows an employer to condition offers of employment to handicapped persons on the results of medical examinations, so long as the examinations are administered to all employees in a nondiscriminatory manner and the results are treated on a confidential basis.</P>
              <P>19. <E T="03">Specific acts of Discrimination.</E> Sections 104.15 (recruitment), 104.16 (compensation), 104.17 (job classification and structure) and 104.18 (fringe benefits) have been deleted from the regulation as unnecessarily duplicative of § 104.11 (discrimination prohibited). The deletion of these sections in no way changes the substantive obligations of employers subject to this regulation from those set forth in the July 16 proposed regulation. These deletions bring the regulation closer in form to the Department of Labor's section 503 regulation.</P>
              <P>A proposed section, concerning fringe benefits, had allowed for differences in benefits or contributions between handicapped and nonhandicapped persons in situations only where such differences could be justified on an actuarial basis. Section 104.11 simply bars discrimination in providing fringe benefits and does not address the issue of actuarial differences. The Department believes that currently available data and experience do not demonstrate a basis for promulgating a regulation specifically allowing for differences in benefits or contributions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart C—Program Accessibility</HD>
              <P>In general, Subpart C prohibits the exclusion of qualified handicapped persons from federally assisted programs or activities because a recipient's facilities are inaccessible or unusable.</P>
              <P>20. <E T="03">Existing facilities.</E> Section 104.22 maintains the same standard for nondiscrimination in regard to existing facilities as was included in the proposed regulation. The section states that a recipients program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, must be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Paragraphs (a) and (b) make clear that a recipient is not required to make each of its existing facilities accessible to handicapped persons if its program as a whole is accessible. Accessibility to the recipient's program or activity may be achieved by a number of means, including redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, and making aides available to beneficiaries. In choosing among methods of compliance, recipients are required to give priority consideration to methods that will be consistent with provision of services in the most appropriate integrated setting. Structural changes in existing facilities are required only where there is no other feasible way to make the recipient's program accessible.</P>
              <P>Under § 104.22, a university does not have to make all of its existing classroom buildings accessible to handicapped students if some of its buildings are already accessible and if it is possible to reschedule or relocate enough classes so as to offer all required courses and a reasonable selection of elective courses in accessible facilities. If sufficient relocation of classes is not possible using existing facilities, enough alterations to ensure program accessibility are required. A university may not exclude a handicapped student from a specifically requested course offering because it is not offered in an accessible location, but it need not make every section of that course accessible.</P>
              <P>Commenters representing several institutions of higher education have suggested that it would be appropriate for one postsecondary institution in a geographical area to be made accessible to handicapped persons and for other colleges and universities in that area to participate in that school's program, thereby developing an educational consortium for the postsecondary education of handicapped students. The Department believes that such a consortium, when developed and applied only to handicapped persons, would not constitute compliance with § 104.22, but would discriminate against qualified handicapped persons by restricting their choice in selecting institutions of higher education and would, therefore, be inconsistent with the basic objectives of the statute.</P>

              <P>Nothing in this regulation, however, should be read as prohibiting institutions from forming consortia for the benefit of all students. Thus, if three colleges decide that it would be cost-efficient for one college to offer biology, the second physics, and the third chemistry to all students at the three colleges, the arrangement would not violate section 504. On the other hand, it would violate the regulation if the same institutions set up a consortium under which one college undertook to make its biology lab accessible, another its physics lab, and a third its chemistry lab, and under which mobility-impaired handicapped students (but not other <PRTPAGE P="334"/>students) were required to attend the particular college that is accessible for the desired courses.</P>
              <P>Similarly, while a public school district need not make each of its buildings completely accessible, it may not make only one facility or part of a facility accessible if the result is to segregate handicapped students in a single setting.</P>
              <P>All recipients that provide health, welfare, or other social services may also comply with § 104.22 by delivering services at alternate accessible sites or making home visits. Thus, for example, a pharmacist might arrange to make home deliveries of drugs. Under revised § 104.22(c), small providers of health, welfare, and social services (those with fewer than fifteen employees) may refer a beneficiary to an accessible provider of the desired service, but only if no means of meeting the program accessibility requirement other than a significant alteration in existing facilities is available. The referring recipient has the responsibility of determining that the other provider is in fact accessible and willing to provide the service.</P>
              <P>A recent change in the tax law may assist some recipients in meeting their obligations under this section. Under section 2122 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, recipients that pay federal income tax are eligible to claim a tax deduction of up to $25,000 for architectural and transportation modifications made to improve accessibility for handicapped persons. See 42 FR 17870 (April 4, 1977), adopting 26 CFR 7.190.</P>
              <P>Several commenters expressed concern about the feasibility of compliance with the program accessibility standard. The Secretary believes that the standard is flexible enough to permit recipients to devise ways to make their programs accessible short of extremely expensive or impractical physical changes in facilities. Accordingly, the section does not allow for waivers. The Department is ready at all times to provide technical assistance to recipients in meeting their program accessibility responsibilities. For this purpose, the Department is establishing a special technical assistance unit. Recipients are encouraged to call upon the unit staff for advice and guidance both on structural modifications and on other ways of meeting the program accessibility requirement.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (d) has been amended to require recipients to make all nonstructural adjustments necessary for meeting the program accessibility standard within sixty days. Only where structural changes in facilities are necessary will a recipient be permitted up to three years to accomplish program accessibility. It should be emphasized that the three-year time period is not a waiting period and that all changes must be accomplished as expeditiously as possible. Further, it is the Department's belief, after consultation with experts in the field, that outside ramps to buildings can be constructed quickly and at relatively low cost. Therefore, it will be expected that such structural additions will be made promptly to comply with § 104.22(d).</P>
              <P>The regulation continues to provide, as did the proposed version, that a recipient planning to achieve program accessibility by making structural changes must develop a transition plan for such changes within six months of the effective date of the regulation. A number of commenters suggested extending that period to one year. The secretary believes that such an extension is unnecessary and unwise. Planning for any necessary structural changes should be undertaken promptly to ensure that they can be completed within the three-year period. The elements of the transition plan as required by the regulation remain virtually unchanged from the proposal but § 104.22(d) now includes a requirement that the recipient make the plan available for public inspection.</P>
              <P>Several commenters expressed concern that the program accessibility standard would result in the segregation of handicapped persons in educational institutions. The regulation will not be applied to permit such a result. See § 104.4(c)(2)(iv), prohibiting unnecessarily separate treatment; § 104.35, requiring that students in elementary and secondary schools be educated in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs; and new § 104.43(d), applying the same standard to postsecondary education.</P>
              <P>We have received some comments from organizations of handicapped persons on the subject of requiring, over an extended period of time, a barrier-free environment—that is, requiring the removal of all architectural barriers in existing facilities. The Department has considered these comments but has decided to take no further action at this time concerning these suggestions, believing that such action should only be considered in light of experience in implementing the program accessibility standard.</P>
              <P>21. <E T="03">New construction.</E> Section 104.23 requires that all new facilities, as well as alterations that could affect access to and use of existing facilities, be designed and constructed in a manner so as to make the facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Section 104.23(a) has been amended so that it applies to each newly constructed facility if the construction was commenced after the effective date of the regulation. The words “if construction has commenced” will be considered to mean “if groundbreaking has taken place.” Thus, a recipient will not be required to alter the design of a facility that has progressed beyond groundbreaking prior to the effective date of the regulation.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (b) requires certain alterations to conform to the requirement of physical <PRTPAGE P="335"/>accessibility in paragraph (a). If an alteration is undertaken to a portion of a building the accessibility of which could be improved by the manner in which the alteration is carried out, the alteration must be made in that manner. Thus, if a doorway or wall is being altered, the door or other wall opening must be made wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs. On the other hand, if the alteration consists of altering ceilings, the provisions of this section are not applicable because this alteration cannot be done in a way that affects the accessibility of that portion of the building. The phrase “to the maximum extent feasible” has been added to allow for the occasional case in which the nature of an existing facility is such as to make it impractical or prohibitively expensive to renovate the building in a manner that results in its being entirely barrier-free. In all such cases, however, the alteration should provide the maximum amount of physical accessibility feasible.</P>
              <P>Section 104.23(d) of the proposed regulation, providing for a limited deferral of action concerning facilities that are subject to section 502 as well as section 504 of the Act, has been deleted. The Secretary believes that the provision is unnecessary and inappropriate to this regulation. The Department will, however, seek to coordinate enforcement activities under this regulation with those of the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart D—Preschool, Elementary, and Secondary Education</HD>
              <P>Subpart D sets forth requirements for nondiscrimination in preschool, elementary, secondary, and adult education programs and activities, including secondary vocational education programs. In this context, the term “adult education” refers only to those educational programs and activities for adults that are operated by elementary and secondary schools.</P>
              <P>The provisions of Subpart D apply to state and local educational agencies. Although the subpart applies, in general, to both public and private education programs and activities that are federally assisted, §§ 104.32 and 104.33 apply only to public programs and § 104.39 applies only to private programs; §§ 104.35 and 104.36 apply both to public programs and to those private programs that include special services for handicapped students.</P>

              <P>Subpart B generally conforms to the standards established for the education of handicapped persons in <E T="03">Mills</E> v. <E T="03">Board of Education of the District of Columbia,</E> 348 F. Supp. 866 (D.D.C. 1972), <E T="03">Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children</E> v. <E T="03">Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,</E> 344 F. Supp. 1257 (E.D. 1971), 343 F. Supp. 279 (E.D. Pa. 1972), and <E T="03">Lebanks</E> v. <E T="03">Spears,</E> 60, F.R.D. 135 (E.D. La. 1973), as well as in the Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended by Pub. L. 94-142 (the EHA).</P>
              <P>The basic requirements common to those cases, to the EHA, and to this regulation are (1) that handicapped persons, regardless of the nature or severity of their handicap, be provided a free appropriate public education, (2) that handicapped students be educated with nonhandicapped students to the maximum extent appropriate to their needs, (3) that educational agencies undertake to identify and locate all unserved handicapped children, (4) that evaluation procedures be improved in order to avoid the inappropriate education that results from the misclassification of students, and (5) that procedural safeguard be established to enable parents and guardians to influence decisions regarding the evaluation and placement of their children. These requirements are designed to ensure that no handicapped child is excluded from school on the basis of handicap and, if a recipient demonstrates that placement in a regular educational setting cannot be achieved satisfactorily, that the student is provided with adequate alternative services suited to the student's needs without additional cost to the student's parents or guardian. Thus, a recipient that operates a public school system must either educate handicapped children in its regular program or provide such children with an appropriate alternative education at public expense.</P>
              <P>It is not the intention of the Department, except in extraordinary circumstances, to review the result of individual placement and other educational decisions, so long as the school district complies with the “process” requirements of this subpart (concerning identification and location, evaluation, and due process procedures). However, the Department will place a high priority on investigating cases which may involve exclusion of a child from the education system or a pattern or practice of discriminatory placements or education.</P>
              <P>22. <E T="03">Location and notification.</E> Section 104.32 requires public schools to take steps annually to identify and locate handicapped children who are not receiving an education and to publicize to handicapped children and their parents the rights and duties established by section 504 and this regulation. This section has been shortened without substantive change.</P>
              <P>23. <E T="03">Free appropriate public education.</E> Under § 104.33(a), a recipient is responsible for providing a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's jurisdiction. The word “in” encompasses the concepts of both domicile and actual residence. If a recipient places a child in a program other than its own, it remains financially responsible for the child, whether or not the other program is operated by another recipient or educational <PRTPAGE P="336"/>agency. Moreover, a recipient may not place a child in a program that is inappropriate or that otherwise violates the requirements of Subpart D. And in no case may a recipient refuse to provide services to a handicapped child in its jurisdiction because of another person's or entity's failure to assume financial responsibility.</P>
              <P>Section 104.33(b) concerns the provision of appropriate educational services to handicapped children. To be appropriate, such services must be designed to meet handicapped children's individual educational needs to the same extent that those of nonhandicapped children are met. An appropriate education could consist of education in regular classes, education in regular classes with the use of supplementary services, or special education and related services. Special education may include specially designed instruction in classrooms, at home, or in private or public institutions and may be accompanied by such related services as developmental, corrective, and other supportive services (including psychological, counseling, and medical diagnostic services). The placement of the child must however, be consistent with the requirements of § 104.34 and be suited to his or her educational needs.</P>
              <P>The quality of the educational services provided to handicapped students must equal that of the services provided to nonhandicapped students; thus, handicapped student's teachers must be trained in the instruction of persons with the handicap in question and appropriate materials and equipment must be available. The Department is aware that the supply of adequately trained teachers may, at least at the outset of the imposition of this requirement, be insufficient to meet the demand of all recipients. This factor will be considered in determining the appropriateness of the remedy for noncompliance with this section. A new § 104.33(b)(2) has been added, which allows this requirement to be met through the full implementation of an individualized education program developed in accordance with the standards of the EHA.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (c) of § 104.33 sets forth the specific financial obligations of a recipient. If a recipient does not itself provide handicapped persons with the requisite services, it must assume the cost of any alternate placement. If, however, a recipient offers adequate services and if alternate placement is chosen by a student's parent or guardian, the recipient need not assume the cost of the outside services. (If the parent or guardian believes that his or her child cannot be suitably educated in the recipient's program, he or she may make use of the procedures established in § 104.36.) Under this paragraph, a recipient's obligation extends beyond the provision of tuition payments in the case of placement outside the regular program. Adequate transportation must also be provided. Recipients must also pay for psychological services and those medical services necessary for diagnostic and evaluative purposes.</P>
              <P>If the recipient places a student, because of his or her handicap, in a program that necessitates his or her being away from home, the payments must also cover room and board and nonmedical care (including custodial and supervisory care). When residential care is necessitated not by the student's handicap but by factors such as the student's home conditions, the recipient is not required to pay the cost of room and board.</P>
              <P>Two new sentences have been added to paragraph (c)(1) to make clear that a recipient's financial obligations need not be met solely through its own funds. Recipients may rely on funds from any public or private source including insurers and similar third parties.</P>
              <P>The EHA requires a free appropriate education to be provided to handicapped children “no later than September 1, 1978,” but section 504 contains no authority for delaying enforcement. To resolve this problem, a new paragraph (d) has been added to § 104.33. Section 104.33(d) requires recipients to achieve full compliance with the free appropriate public education requirements of § 104.33 as expeditiously as possible, but in no event later than September 1, 1978. The provision also makes clear that, as of the effective date of this regulation, no recipient may exclude a qualified handicapped child from its educational program. This provision against exclusion is consistent with the order of providing services set forth in section 612(3) of the EHA, which places the highest priority on providing services to handicapped children who are not receiving an education.</P>
              <P>24. <E T="03">Educational setting.</E> Section 104.34 prescribes standards for educating handicapped persons with nonhandicapped persons to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the handicapped person in question. A handicapped student may be removed from the regular educational setting only where the recipient can show that the needs of the student would, on balance, be served by placement in another setting.</P>
              <P>Although under § 104.34, the needs of the handicapped person are determinative as to proper placement, it should be stressed that, where a handicapped student is so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other students is significantly impaired, the needs of the handicapped child cannot be met in that environment. Therefore, regular placement would not be appropriate to his or her needs and would not be required by § 104.34.</P>

              <P>Among the factors to be considered in placing a child is the need to place the child as close to home as possible. A new sentence <PRTPAGE P="337"/>has been added to paragraph (a) requiring recipients to take this factor into account. As pointed out in several comments, the parents' right under § 104.36 to challenge the placement of their child extends not only to placement in special classes or separate schools but also to placement in a distant school and, in particular, to residential placement. An equally appropriate educational program may exist closer to home; this issue may be raised by the parent or guardian under §§ 104.34 and 104.36.</P>
              <P>New paragraph (b) specified that handicapped children must also be provided nonacademic services in as integrated a setting as possible. This requirement is especially important for children whose educational needs necessitate their being solely with other handicapped children during most of each day. To the maximum extent appropriate, children in residential settings are also to be provided opportunities for participation with other children.</P>
              <P>Section 104.34(c) requires that any facilities that are identifiable as being for handicapped students be comparable in quality to other facilities of the recipient. A number of comments objected to this section on the basis that it encourages the creation and maintenance of such facilities. This is not the intent of the provision. A separate facility violates section 504 unless it is indeed necessary to the provision of an appropriate education to certain handicapped students. In those instances in which such facilities are necessary (as might be the case, for example, for persons with severe intellectual disabilities), this provision requires that the educational services provided be comparable to those provided in the facilities of the recipient that are not identifiable as being for handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>25. <E T="03">Evaluation and placement.</E> Because the failure to provide handicapped persons with an appropriate education is so frequently the result of misclassification or misplacement, § 104.33(b)(1) makes compliance with its provisions contingent upon adherence to certain procedures designed to ensure appropriate classification and placement. These procedures, delineated in §§ 104.35 and 104.36, are concerned with testing and other evaluation methods and with procedural due process rights.</P>
              <P>Section 104.35(a) requires that an individual evaluation be conducted before any action is taken with respect either to the initial placement of a handicapped child in a regular or special education program or to any subsequent significant change in that placement. Thus, a full reevaluation is not required every time an adjustment in placement is made. “Any action” includes denials of placement.</P>
              <P>Paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 104.35 establishes procedures designed to ensure that children are not misclassified, unnecessarily labeled as being handicapped, or incorrectly placed because of inappropriate selection, administration, or interpretation of evaluation materials. This problem has been extensively documented in “Issues in the Classification of Children,” a report by the Project on Classification of Exceptional Children, in which the HEW Interagency Task Force participated. The provisions of these paragraphs are aimed primarily at abuses in the placement process that result from misuse of, or undue or misplaced reliance on, standardized scholastic aptitude tests.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (b) has been shortened but not substantively changed. The requirement in former subparagraph (1) that recipients provide and administer evaluation materials in the native language of the student has been deleted as unnecessary, since the same requirement already exists under title VI and is more appropriately covered under that statute. Paragraphs (1) and (2) are, in general, intended to prevent misinterpretation and similar misuse of test scores and, in particular, to avoid undue reliance on general intelligence tests. Subparagraph (3) requires a recipient to administer tests to a student with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills in whatever manner is necessary to avoid distortion of the test results by the impairment. Former subparagraph (4) has been deleted as unnecessarily repetitive of the other provisions of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (c) requires a recipient to draw upon a variety of sources in the evaluation process so that the possibility of error in classification is minimized. In particular, it requires that all significant factors relating to the learning process, including adaptive behavior, be considered. (Adaptive behavior is the effectiveness with which the individual meets the standards of personal independence and social responsibility expected of his or her age and cultural group.) Information from all sources must be documented and considered by a group of persons, and the procedure must ensure that the child is placed in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>

              <P>The proposed regulation would have required a complete individual reevaluation of the student each year. The Department has concluded that it is inappropriate in the section 504 regulation to require full reevaluations on such a rigid schedule. Accordingly, § 104.35(c) requires periodic reevaluations and specifies that reevaluations in accordance with the EHA will constitute compliance. The proposed regulation implementing the EHA allows reevaluation at three-year intervals except under certain specified circumstances.<PRTPAGE P="338"/>
              </P>
              <P>Under § 104.36, a recipient must establish a system of due process procedures to be afforded to parents or guardians before the recipient takes any action regarding the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a person who, because of handicap, needs or is believed to need special education or related services. This section has been revised. Because the due process procedures of the EHA, incorporated by reference in the proposed section 504 regulation, are inappropriate for some recipients not subject to that Act, the section now specifies minimum necessary procedures: notice, a right to inspect records, an impartial hearing with a right to representation by counsel, and a review procedure. The EHA procedures remain one means of meeting the regulation's due process requirements, however, and are recommended to recipients as a model.</P>
              <P>26. <E T="03">Nonacademic services.</E> Section 104.37 requires a recipient to provide nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in such manner as is necessary to afford handicapped students an equal opportunity for participation. Because these services and activities are part of a recipient's education program, they must, in accordance with the provisions of § 104.34, be provided in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
              <P>Revised paragraph (c)(2) does permit separation or differentiation with respect to the provision of physical education and athletics activities, but only if qualified handicapped students are also allowed the opportunity to compete for regular teams or participate in regular activities. Most handicapped students are able to participate in one or more regular physical education and athletics activities. For example, a student in a wheelchair can participate in regular archery course, as can a deaf student in a wrestling course.</P>
              <P>Finally, the one-year transition period provided in a proposed section was deleted in response to the almost unanimous objection of commenters to that provision.</P>
              <P>27. <E T="03">Preschool and adult education.</E> Section 104.38 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in preschool and adult education programs. Former paragraph (b), which emphasized that compensatory programs for disadvantaged children are subject to section 504, has been deleted as unnecessary, since it is comprehended by paragraph (a).</P>
              <P>28. <E T="03">Private education.</E> Section 104.39 sets forth the requirements applicable to recipients that operate private education programs and activities. The obligations of these recipients have been changed in two significant respects: first, private schools are subject to the evaluation and due process provisions of the subpart only if they operate special education programs; second, under § 104.39(b), they may charge more for providing services to handicapped students than to nonhandicapped students to the extent that additional charges can be justified by increased costs.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (a) of § 104.39 is intended to make clear that recipients that operate private education programs and activities are not required to provide an appropriate education to handicapped students with special educational needs if the recipient does not offer programs designed to meet those needs. Thus, a private school that has no program for persons with intellectual disabilities is neither required to admit such a person into its program nor to arrange or pay for the provision of the person's education in another program. A private recipient without a special program for blind students, however, would not be permitted to exclude, on the basis of blindness, a blind applicant who is able to participate in the regular program with minor adjustments in the manner in which the program is normally offered.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart E—Postsecondary Education</HD>
              <P>Subpart E prescribes requirements for nondiscrimination in recruitment, admission, and treatment of students in postsecondary education programs and activities, including vocational education.</P>
              <P>29. <E T="03">Admission and recruitment.</E> In addition to a general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of handicap in § 104.42(a), the regulation delineates, in § 104.42(b), specific prohibitions concerning the establishment of limitations on admission of handicapped students, the use of tests or selection criteria, and preadmission inquiry. Several changes have been made in this provision.</P>
              <P>Section 104.42(b) provides that postsecondary educational institutions may not use any test or criterion for admission that has a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons unless it has been validated as a predictor of academic success and alternate tests or criteria with a less disproportionate, adverse effect are shown by the Department to be available. There are two significant changes in this approach from the July 16 proposed regulation.</P>
              <P>First, many commenters expressed concern that § 104.42(b)(2)(ii) could be interpreted to require a “global search” for alternate tests that do not have a disproportionate, adverse impact on handicapped persons. This was not the intent of the provision and, therefore, it has been amended to place the burden on the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, rather than on the recipient, to identify alternate tests.</P>

              <P>Second, a new paragraph (d), concerning validity studies, has been added. Under the proposed regulation, overall success in an education program, not just first-year grades, was the criterion against which admissions tests were to be validated. This approach has been changed to reflect the comment of professional testing services that <PRTPAGE P="339"/>use of first year grades would be less disruptive of present practice and that periodic validity studies against overall success in the education program would be sufficient check on the reliability of first-year grades.</P>
              <P>Section 104.42(b)(3) also requires a recipient to assure itself that admissions tests are selected and administered to applicants with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills in such manner as is necessary to avoid unfair distortion of test results. Methods have been developed for testing the aptitude and achievement of persons who are not able to take written tests or even to make the marks required for mechanically scored objective tests; in addition, methods for testing persons with visual or hearing impairments are available. A recipient, under this paragraph, must assure itself that such methods are used with respect to the selection and administration of any admissions tests that it uses.</P>
              <P>Section 104.42(b)(3)(iii) has been amended to require that admissions tests be administered in facilities that, on the whole, are accessible. In this context, “on the whole” means that not all of the facilities need be accessible so long as a sufficient number of facilities are available to handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>Revised § 104.42(b)(4) generally prohibits preadmission inquiries as to whether an applicant has a handicap. The considerations that led to this revision are similar to those underlying the comparable revision of § 104.14 on preemployment inquiries. The regulation does, however, allow inquiries to be made, after admission but before enrollment, as to handicaps that may require accommodation.</P>
              <P>New paragraph (c) parallels the section on preemployment inquiries and allows postsecondary institutions to inquire about applicants' handicaps before admission, subject to certain safeguards, if the purpose of the inquiry is to take remedial action to correct past discrimination or to take voluntary action to overcome the limited participation of handicapped persons in postsecondary educational institutions.</P>
              <P>Proposed § 104.42(c), which would have allowed different admissions criteria in certain cases for handicapped persons, was widely misinterpreted in comments from both handicapped persons and recipients. We have concluded that the section is unnecessary, and it has been deleted.</P>
              <P>30. <E T="03">Treatment of students.</E> Section 104.43 contains general provisions prohibiting the discriminatory treatment of qualified handicapped applicants. Paragraph (b) requires recipients to ensure that equal opportunities are provided to its handicapped students in education programs and activities that are not operated by the recipient. The recipient must be satisfied that the outside education program or activity as a whole is nondiscriminatory. For example, a college must ensure that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur in connection with teaching assignments of student teachers in elementary or secondary schools not operated by the college. Under the “as a whole” wording, the college could continue to use elementary or secondary school systems that discriminate if, and only if, the college's student teaching program, when viewed in its entirety, offered handicapped student teachers the same range and quality of choice in student teaching assignments afforded nonhandicapped students.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (c) of this section prohibits a recipient from excluding qualified handicapped students from any course, course of study, or other part of its education program or activity. This paragraph is designed to eliminate the practice of excluding handicapped persons from specific courses and from areas of concentration because of factors such as ambulatory difficulties of the student or assumptions by the recipient that no job would be available in the area in question for a person with that handicap.</P>
              <P>New paragraph (d) requires postsecondary institutions to operate their programs and activities so that handicapped students are provided services in the most integrated setting appropriate. Thus, if a college had several elementary physics classes and had moved one such class to the first floor of the science building to accommodate students in wheelchairs, it would be a violation of this paragraph for the college to concentrate handicapped students with no mobility impairments in the same class.</P>
              <P>31. <E T="03">Academic adjustments.</E> Paragraph (a) of § 104.44 requires that a recipient make certain adjustments to academic requirements and practices that discriminate or have the effect of discriminating on the basis of handicap. This requirement, like its predecessor in the proposed regulation, does not obligate an institution to waive course or other academic requirements. But such institutions must accommodate those requirements to the needs of individual handicapped students. For example, an institution might permit an otherwise qualified handicapped student who is deaf to substitute an art appreciation or music history course for a required course in music appreciation or could modify the manner in which the music appreciation course is conducted for the deaf student. It shoud be stressed that academic requirements that can be demonstrated by the recipient to be essential to its program of instruction or to particular degrees need not be changed.</P>

              <P>Paragraph (b) provides that postsecondary institutions may not impose rules that have the effect of limiting the participation of handicapped students in the education program. Such rules include prohibition of tape recorders or braillers in classrooms and dog <PRTPAGE P="340"/>guides in campus buildings. Several recipients expressed concern about allowing students to tape record lectures because the professor may later want to copyright the lectures. This problem may be solved by requiring students to sign agreements that they will not release the tape recording or transcription or otherwise hinder the professor's ability to obtain a copyright.</P>
              <P>Paragraph (c) of this section, concerning the administration of course examinations to students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, parallels the regulation's provisions on admissions testing (§ 104.42(b)) and will be similarly interpreted.</P>
              <P>Under § 104.44(d), a recipient must ensure that no handicapped student is subject to discrimination in the recipient's program because of the absence of necessary auxiliary educational aids. Colleges and universities expressed concern about the costs of compliance with this provision.</P>
              <P>The Department emphasizes that recipients can usually meet this obligation by assisting students in using existing resources for auxiliary aids such as state vocational rehabilitation agencies and private charitable organizations. Indeed, the Department anticipates that the bulk of auxiliary aids will be paid for by state and private agencies, not by colleges or universities. In those circumstances where the recipient institution must provide the educational auxiliary aid, the institution has flexibility in choosing the methods by which the aids will be supplied. For example, some universities have used students to work with the institution's handicapped students. Other institutions have used existing private agencies that tape texts for handicapped students free of charge in order to reduce the number of readers needed for visually impaired students.</P>
              <P>As long as no handicapped person is excluded from a program because of the lack of an appropriate aid, the recipient need not have all such aids on hand at all times. Thus, readers need not be available in the recipient's library at all times so long as the schedule of times when a reader is available is established, is adhered to, and is sufficient. Of course, recipients are not required to maintain a complete braille library.</P>
              <P>32. <E T="03">Housing.</E> Section 104.45(a) requires postsecondary institutions to provide housing to handicapped students at the same cost as they provide it to other students and in a convenient, accessible, and comparable manner. Commenters, particularly blind persons pointed out that some handicapped persons can live in any college housing and need not wait to the end of the transition period in subpart C to be offered the same variety and scope of housing accommodations given to nonhandicapped persons. The Department concurs with this position and will interpret this section accordingly.</P>
              <P>A number of colleges and universities reacted negatively to paragraph (b) of this section. It provides that, if a recipient assists in making off-campus housing available to its students, it should develop and implement procedures to assure itself that off-campus housing, as a whole, is available to handicapped students. Since postsecondary institutions are presently required to assure themselves that off-campus housing is provided in a manner that does not discriminate on the basis of sex (§ 106.32 of the title IX regulation), they may use the procedures developed under title IX in order to comply with § 104.45(b). It should be emphasized that not every off-campus living accommodation need be made accessible to handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>33. <E T="03">Health and insurance.</E> A proposed section, providing that recipients may not discriminate on the basis of handicap in the provision of health related services, has been deleted as duplicative of the general provisions of § 104.43. This deletion represents no change in the obligation of recipients to provide nondiscriminatory health and insurance plans. The Department will continue to require that nondiscriminatory health services be provided to handicapped students. Recipients are not required, however, to provide specialized services and aids to handicapped persons in health programs. If, for example, a college infirmary treats only simple disorders such as cuts, bruises, and colds, its obligation to handicapped persons is to treat such disorders for them.</P>
              <P>34. <E T="03">Financial assistance.</E> Section 104.46(a), prohibiting discrimination in providing financial assistance, remains substantively the same. It provides that recipients may not provide less assistance to or limit the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons for such assistance, whether the assistance is provided directly by the recipient or by another entity through the recipient's sponsorship. Awards that are made under wills, trusts, or similar legal instruments in a discriminatory manner are permissible, but only if the overall effect of the recipient's provision of financial assistance is not discriminatory on the basis of handicap.</P>
              <P>It will not be considered discriminatory to deny, on the basis of handicap, an athletic scholarship to a handicapped person if the handicap renders the person unable to qualify for the award. For example, a student who has a neurological disorder might be denied a varsity football scholarship on the basis of his inability to play football, but a deaf person could not, on the basis of handicap, be denied a scholarship for the school's diving team. The deaf person could, however, be denied a scholarship on the basis of comparative diving ability.</P>

              <P>Commenters on § 104.46(b), which applies to assistance in obtaining outside employment for students, expressed similar concerns to <PRTPAGE P="341"/>those raised under § 104.43(b), concerning cooperative programs. This paragraph has been changed in the same manner as § 104.43(b) to include the “as a whole” concept and will be interpreted in the same manner as § 104.43(b).</P>
              <P>35. <E T="03">Nonacademic services.</E> Section 104.47 establishes nondiscrimination standards for physical education and athletics counseling and placement services, and social organizations. This section sets the same standards as does § 104.38 of subpart D, discussed above, and will be interpreted in a similar fashion.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart F—Health, Welfare, and Social Services</HD>
              <P>Subpart F applies to recipients that operate health, welfare, and social service programs. The Department received fewer comments on this subpart than on others.</P>
              <P>Although many commented that subpart F lacked specificity, these commenters provided neither concrete suggestions nor additions. Nevertheless, some changes have been made, pursuant to comment, to clarify the obligations of recipients in specific areas. In addition, in an effort to reduce duplication in the regulation, the section governing recipients providing health services has been consolidated with the section regulating providers of welfare and social services. Since the separate provisions that appeared in the proposed regulation were almost identical, no substantive change should be inferred from their consolidation.</P>
              <P>Several commenters asked whether subpart F applies to vocational rehabilitation agencies whose purpose is to assist in the rehabilitation of handicapped persons. To the extent that such agencies receive financial assistance from the Department, they are covered by subpart F and all other relevant subparts of the regulation. Nothing in this regulation, however, precludes such agencies from servicing only handicapped persons. Indeed, § 104.4(c) permits recipients to offer services or benefits that are limited by federal law to handicapped persons or classes of handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>Many comments suggested requiring state social service agencies to take an active role in the enforcement of section 504 with regard to local social service providers. The Department believes that the possibility for federal-state cooperation in the administration and enforcement of section 504 warrants further consideration.</P>
              <P>A number of comments also discussed whether section 504 should be read to require payment of compensation to institutionalized handicapped patients who perform services for the institution in which they reside. The Department of Labor has recently issued a proposed regulation under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that covers the question of compensation for institutionalized persons. 42 FR 15224 (March 18, 1977). This Department will seek information and comment from the Department of Labor concerning that agency's experience administering the FLSA regulation.</P>
              <P>36. <E T="03">Health, welfare, and other social service providers.</E> Section 104.52(a) has been expanded in several respects. The addition of new paragraph (a)(2) is intended to make clear the basic requirement of equal opportunity to receive benefits or services in the health, welfare, and social service areas. The paragraph parallels §§ 104.4(b)(ii) and 104.43(b). New paragraph (a)(3) requires the provision of effective benefits or services, as defined in § 104.4(b)(2) (i.e., benefits or services which “afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result (or) to gain the same benefit * * *”).</P>
              <P>Section 104.52(a) also includes provisions concerning the limitation of benefits or services to handicapped persons and the subjection of handicapped persons to different eligibility standards. One common misconception about the regulation is that it would require specialized hospitals and other health care providers to treat all handicapped persons. The regulation makes no such requirement. Thus, a burn treatment center need not provide other types of medical treatment to handicapped persons unless it provides such medical services to nonhandicapped persons. It could not, however, refuse to treat the burns of a deaf person because of his or her deafness.</P>
              <P>Commenters had raised the question of whether the prohibition against different standards of eligibility might preclude recipients from providing special services to handicapped persons or classes of handicapped persons. The regulation will not be so interpreted, and the specific section in question has been eliminated. Section 104.4(c) makes clear that special programs for handicapped persons are permitted.</P>
              <P>A new paragraph (a)(5) concerning the provision of different or separate services or benefits has been added. This provision prohibits such treatment unless necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with benefits and services that are as effective as those provided to others.</P>
              <P>Section 104.52(b) has been amended to cover written material concerning waivers of rights or consent to treatment as well as general notices concerning health benefits or services. The section requires the recipient to ensure that qualified handicapped persons are not denied effective notice because of their handicap. For example, recipients could use several different types of notice in order to reach persons with impaired vision or hearing, such as brailled messages, radio spots, and tacticle devices on cards or envelopes to inform blind persons of the need to call the recipient for further information.</P>

              <P>Section 104.52(c) is a new section requiring recipient hospitals to establish a procedure for effective communication with persons <PRTPAGE P="342"/>with impaired hearing for the purpose of providing emergency health care. Although it would be appropriate for a hospital to fulfill its responsibilities under this section by having a full-time interpreter for the deaf on staff, there may be other means of accomplishing the desired result of assuring that some means of communication is immediately available for deaf persons needing emergency treatment.</P>
              <P>Section 104.52(c), also a new provision, requires recipients with fifteen or more employees to provide appropriate auxiliary aids for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills. Further, the Assistant Secretary may require a small provider to furnish auxiliary aids where the provision of aids would not adversely affect the ability of the recipient to provide its health benefits or service.</P>
              <P>37. <E T="03">Treatment of Drug Addicts and Alcoholics.</E> Section 104.53 is a new section that prohibits discrimination in the treatment and admission of drug and alcohol addicts to hospitals and outpatient facilities. Section 104.53 prohibits discrimination against drug abusers by operators of outpatient facilities, despite the fact that section 407 pertains only to hospitals, because of the broader application of section 504. This provision does not mean that all hospitals and outpatient facilities must treat drug addiction and alcoholism. It simply means, for example, that a cancer clinic may not refuse to treat cancer patients simply because they are also alcoholics.</P>
              <P>38. <E T="03">Education of institutionalized persons.</E> The regulation retains § 104.54 of the proposed regulation that requires that an appropriate education be provided to qualified handicapped persons who are confined to residential institutions or day care centers.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart G—Procedures</HD>
              <P>In § 104.61, the Secretary has adopted the title VI complaint and enforcement procedures for use in implementing section 504 until such time as they are superseded by the issuance of a consolidated procedureal regulation applicable to all of the civil rights statutes and executive orders administered by the Department.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Department shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(1) Necessarily require the Department to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the Department to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
            <P>(3)(i) Require the Department to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens.</P>
            <P>(ii) The Department has the burden of proving that compliance with § 105.32(a) would result in that alteration or those burdens.</P>
            <P>(iii) The decision that compliance would result in that alteration or those burdens must be made by the Secretary after considering all of the Department's resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion.</P>
            <P>(iv) If an action would result in that alteration or those burdens, the Department shall take any other action that would not result in the alteration or burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) The Department may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignments of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.</P>

In cases were a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 105.32 (a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
            <P>(i) Using audiovisual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
            <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>

            <P>(ii) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
            <P>(iii) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of ED's age discrimination regulations?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The purpose of these regulations is to set out ED's rules for implementing the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act permits federally assisted programs or activities, and recipients of Federal funds, to continue to use age distinctions and factors other than age that meet the requirements of the Act.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Duration of obligation.</E> (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended in the form of real property or to provide real property or structures on the property, the assurance will obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for the purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.<PRTPAGE P="375"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.</P>
              <P>(3) In all other cases the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Covenants.</E> (1) If Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from ED, the instrument effecting or recording this transfer must contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.</P>
              <P>(2) If no transfer of property is involved but property is purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent transfer of the property.</P>
              <P>(3) If Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from ED, the covenant must also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by ED to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on the property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, ED may, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish that financing and upon conditions that ED deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of the right to revert title for as long as the lien of the mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.</P>

              <P>(c) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant and recipient sign it. The mediator shall send a copy of the agreement to ED. ED takes no further action on the complaint unless informed that the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the agreement, at which time ED reinstates the complaint.</P>

New Federal financial assistance from ED does not include increases in funding as a result of changed computation of formula awards or assistance approved prior to the initiation of termination proceedings.</P>
              <P>(2) ED does not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under § 110.35(a)(1). A deferral may not continue for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and ED. A deferral may not continue for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.</P>

                <SUBJECT>State responsibilities for developing challenging academic standards.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Academic standards in general.</E> A State must adopt challenging academic content standards and aligned academic achievement standards that will be used by the State, its local educational agencies (LEAs), and its schools to carry out this subpart. These academic standards must—</P>
                <P>(1) Be the same academic content standards and aligned academic achievement standards that the State applies to all public schools and public school students in the State, including the public schools and public school students served under this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, which applies only to the State's academic achievement standards;</P>
                <P>(2) With respect to the academic achievement standards, include the same knowledge, skills, and levels of achievement expected of all public school students in the State, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(3) Include at least mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, and may include other subjects determined by the State.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Academic content standards.</E> (1) The challenging academic content standards required under paragraph (a) of this section must—</P>
                <P>(i) Specify what all students are expected to know and be able to do;</P>
                <P>(ii) Contain coherent and rigorous content; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Encourage the teaching of advanced skills.</P>
                <P>(2) A State's academic content standards may—<PRTPAGE P="385"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) Be grade specific; or,</P>
                <P>(ii) Cover more than one grade if grade-level content expectations are provided for each of grades 3 through 8.</P>
                <P>(3) At the high school level, the academic content standards must define the knowledge and skills that all high school students are expected to know and be able to do in at least reading/language arts, mathematics, and science, irrespective of course titles or years completed.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Academic achievement standards.</E> (1) The challenging academic achievement standards required under paragraph (a) of this section must—</P>
                <P>(i) Be aligned with the State's challenging academic content standards and with entrance requirements for credit-bearing coursework in the system of public higher education in the State and relevant State career and technical education standards; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Include the following components for each content area:</P>
                <P>(A) Not less than three achievement levels that describe at least—</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Two levels of high achievement—proficient and advanced—that determine how well students are mastering the material in the State's academic content standards; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A third level of achievement—basic—to provide complete information about the progress of lower-achieving students toward mastering the proficient and advanced levels of achievement.</P>
                <P>(B) Descriptions of the competencies associated with each achievement level.</P>
                <P>(C) Assessment scores (“cut scores”) that differentiate among the achievement levels as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, and a description of the rationale and procedures used to determine each achievement level.</P>
                <P>(2) A State must develop academic achievement standards for every grade and subject assessed, even if the State's academic content standards cover more than one grade.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternate academic achievement standards.</E> For students under section 602(3) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) with the most significant cognitive disabilities who take an alternate assessment, a State may, through a documented and validated standards-setting process, define alternate academic achievement standards, provided those standards—</P>
                <P>(1) Are aligned with the State's challenging academic content standards;</P>
                <P>(2) Promote access to the general curriculum, consistent with the IDEA;</P>
                <P>(3) Reflect professional judgment as to the highest possible standards achievable by such students;</P>
                <P>(4) Are designated in the individualized education program developed under section 614(d)(3) of the IDEA for each such student as the academic achievement standards that will be used for the student; and</P>

                <P>(5) Are aligned to ensure that a student who meets the alternate academic achievement standards is on track to pursue postsecondary education or employment, consistent with the purposes of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, as in effect on July 22, 2014, and § 200.2(b)(3)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>).</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Modified academic achievement standards.</E> A State may not define or implement for use under this subpart any alternate or modified academic achievement standards for children with disabilities under section 602(3) of the IDEA that are not alternate academic achievement standards that meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">English language proficiency standards.</E> A State must adopt English language proficiency standards that—</P>
                <P>(1) Are derived from the four recognized domains of speaking, listening, reading, and writing;</P>
                <P>(2) Address the different proficiency levels of English learners; and</P>
                <P>(3) Are aligned with the State's challenging academic content standards and aligned academic achievement standards.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Subjects without standards.</E> If an LEA serves students under subpart A of this part in subjects for which a State has not developed academic standards, the State must describe in its State plan a strategy for ensuring that those students are taught the same knowledge and skills and held to the same expectations in those subjects as are all other students.<PRTPAGE P="386"/>
                </P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Other subjects with standards.</E> If a State has developed standards in other subjects for all students, the State must apply those standards to students participating under subpart A of this part.</P>

                <P>(i) Must, except as provided in § 200.6(c)(7)(iii), measure a student's academic proficiency based on the challenging State academic standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled and growth toward those standards; and</P>
                <P>(ii) May measure a student's academic proficiency and growth using items above or below the student's grade level.</P>
                <P>(2) If a State administers a computer-adaptive assessment, the determination under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section of a student's academic proficiency for the grade in which the student is enrolled must be reported on all reports required by § 200.8 and section 1111(h) of the Act.</P>
                <P>(d) A State must submit evidence for peer review under section 1111(a)(4) of the Act that its assessments under this section and §§ 200.3, 200.4, 200.5(b), 200.6(c), 200.6(f), 200.6(h), and 200.6(j) meet all applicable requirements.</P>

                <P>(iv) Include a plan and timeline by which—</P>
                <P>(A) The State will improve the implementation of its guidelines under paragraph (d) of this section, including by reviewing and, if necessary, revising its definition under paragraph (d)(1), so that the State meets the cap in paragraph (c)(2) of this section in each subject for which assessments are administered under § 200.2(a)(1) in future school years;</P>
                <P>(B) The State will take additional steps to support and provide appropriate oversight to each LEA that the State anticipates will assess more than 1.0 percent of its assessed students in a given subject in a school year using an alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic achievement standards to ensure that only students with the most significant cognitive disabilities take an alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic achievement standards. The State must describe how it will monitor and regularly evaluate each such LEA to ensure that the LEA provides sufficient training such that school staff who participate as members of an IEP team or other placement team understand and implement the guidelines established by the State under paragraph (d) of this section so that all students are appropriately assessed; and</P>
                <P>(C) The State will address any disproportionality in the percentage of students taking an alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic achievement standards as identified through the data provided in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section; and</P>

                <P>(1) Establish, consistent with section 612(a)(16)(C) of the IDEA, and monitor implementation of clear and appropriate guidelines for IEP teams to apply in determining, on a case-by-case basis, which students with the most significant cognitive disabilities will be assessed based on alternate academic achievement standards. Such guidelines must include a State definition of “students with the most significant cognitive disabilities” that addresses factors related to cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior, such that—</P>
                <P>(i) The identification of a student as having a particular disability as defined in the IDEA or as an English learner does not determine whether a student is a student with the most significant cognitive disabilities;</P>
                <P>(ii) A student with the most significant cognitive disabilities is not identified solely on the basis of the student's previous low academic achievement, or the student's previous need for accommodations to participate in general State or districtwide assessments; and</P>
                <P>(iii) A student is identified as having the most significant cognitive disabilities because the student requires extensive, direct individualized instruction and substantial supports to achieve measurable gains on the challenging State academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled;</P>

                <P>(4) Not preclude a student with the most significant cognitive disabilities who takes an alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic <PRTPAGE P="395"/>achievement standards from attempting to complete the requirements for a regular high school diploma;</P>
                <P>(5) Promote, consistent with requirements under the IDEA, the involvement and progress of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities in the general education curriculum that is based on the State's academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled;</P>
                <P>(6) Incorporate the principles of universal design for learning, to the extent feasible, in any alternate assessments aligned with alternate academic achievement standards that the State administers consistent with § 200.2(b)(2)(ii); and</P>
                <P>(7) Develop, disseminate information on, and promote the use of appropriate accommodations consistent with paragraph (b) of this section to ensure that a student with significant cognitive disabilities who does not meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section—</P>
                <P>(i) Participates in academic instruction and assessments for the grade in which the student is enrolled; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Is assessed based on challenging State academic standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled.</P>

                <P>(3) If an LEA ranks its school attendance areas and schools by grade span groupings, the LEA may determine the percentage of children from low-income families in the LEA as a whole or for each grade span grouping.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section, an LEA must allocate to each participating school attendance area or school an amount for each low-income child that is at least 125 percent of the per-pupil amount of funds the LEA received for that year under part A, subpart 2 of Title I. The LEA must calculate this per-pupil amount before it reserves funds under § 200.77, using the poverty measure selected by the LEA under section 1113(a)(5) of the ESEA.</P>
                <P>(2) If an LEA is serving only school attendance areas or schools in which the percentage of children from low-income families is 35 percent or more, the LEA is not required to allocate a per-pupil amount of at least 125 percent.</P>
                <P>(c) An LEA is not required to allocate the same per-pupil amount to each participating school attendance area or school provided the LEA allocates higher per-pupil amounts to areas or schools with higher concentrations of poverty than to areas or schools with lower concentrations of poverty.</P>
                <P>(d) An LEA may reduce the amount of funds allocated under this section to a school attendance area or school if the area or school is spending supplemental State or local funds for programs that meet the requirements in § 200.79(b).</P>
                <P>(e) If an LEA contains two or more counties in their entirety, the LEA must distribute to schools within each county a share of the LEA's total grant that is no less than the county's share of the child count used to calculate the LEA's grant.</P>

              <P>(o) <E T="03">Seasonal employment</E> means employment that occurs only during a certain period of the year because of the cycles of nature and that, by its nature, may not be continuous or carried on throughout the year.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Temporary employment</E> means employment that lasts for a limited period of time, usually a few months, but no longer than 12 months. It typically includes employment where the employer states that the worker was hired for a limited time frame; the worker states that the worker does not intend to remain in that employment indefinitely; or the SEA has determined on some other reasonable basis that the employment is temporary. The definition includes employment that is constant and available year-round only if, within 18 months after the effective date of this regulation and at least once every three years thereafter, the SEA documents that, given the nature of the work, of those workers whose children were previously determined to be eligible based on the State's prior determination of the temporary nature of such employment (or the children themselves if they are the workers), virtually no workers remained employed by the same employer more than 12 months.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">MSIX State record system and data exchange requirements.</E> In order to receive a grant of MEP funds, an SEA must collect, maintain, and submit to MSIX MDEs and otherwise exchange and use information on migratory children in accordance with the requirements of this section. Failure of an SEA to do so constitutes a failure under section 454 of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. 1234c, to comply substantially with a requirement of law applicable to the funds made available under the MEP.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">MSIX data submission requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) In order to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, an SEA that receives a grant of MEP funds must submit electronically to MSIX the MDEs applicable to the child's age and grade level. An SEA must collect and submit the MDEs applicable to the child's age and grade level, regardless of the type of school in which the child is enrolled (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> public, private, or home school), or whether a child is enrolled in any school.</P>
              <P>(ii) For migratory children who are or were enrolled in private schools, the SEA meets its responsibility under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for collecting MDEs applicable to the child's age and grade level by advising the parent of the migratory child, or the migratory child if the child is emancipated, of the necessity of requesting the child's records from the private school, and by facilitating the parent or emancipated child's request to the private school that it provide all necessary information from the child's school records—</P>
              <P>(A) Directly to the parent or emancipated child, in which case the SEA must follow up directly with the parent or child; or</P>
              <P>(B) To the SEA, or a specific local operating agency, for forwarding to MSIX, in which case the SEA must follow up with the parent, emancipated child, or the private school to make sure that the records requested by the parent or emancipated child have been forwarded.</P>
              <P>(iii) For migratory children who are or were enrolled in home schools, the SEA meets its responsibility under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for collecting MDEs applicable to the child's age and grade level by requesting these records, either directly or through a local operating agency, directly from the parent or emancipated child.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Start-up data submissions.</E> No later than 90 calendar days after the effective date of these regulations, an SEA must collect and submit to MSIX each of the MDEs described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section applicable to the child's age and grade level for every migratory child who is eligible to receive MEP services in the State on the effective date of these regulations, other than through continuation of services provided under section 1304(e) of the ESEA.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Subsequent data submissions.</E> An SEA must comply with the following timelines for subsequent data submissions throughout the entire calendar year whether or not local operating agencies or LEAs in the State are closed for summer or intersession periods.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Migratory children for whom an SEA has approved a new Certificate of Eligibility.</E> For every migratory child for whom an SEA approves a new Certificate of Eligibility under § 200.89(c) after <PRTPAGE P="416"/>the effective date of these regulations—</P>
              <P>(A) An SEA must collect and submit to MSIX the MDEs described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section within 10 working days of approving a new Certificate of Eligibility for the migratory child. The SEA is not required to collect and submit MDEs in existence before its approval of a new Certificate of Eligibility for the child except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(B) An SEA that approves a new Certificate of Eligibility for a secondary school-aged migratory child must also—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Collect and submit to MSIX within 10 working days of approving a new Certificate of Eligibility for the child MDEs from the most recent secondary school in that State attended previously by the migratory child; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Notify MSIX within 30 calendar days if one of its local operating agencies obtains records from a secondary school attended previously in another State by the migratory child.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">End of term submissions.</E> (A) Within 30 calendar days of the end of an LEA's or local operating agency's fall, spring, summer, or intersession terms, an SEA must collect and submit to MSIX all MDE updates and newly available MDEs for migratory children who were eligible for the MEP during the term and for whom the SEA submitted data previously under paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) When a migratory child's MEP eligibility expires before the end of a school year, an SEA must submit all MDE updates and newly available MDEs for the child through the end of the school year.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Change of residence submissions.</E> (A) Within four working days of receiving notification from MSIX that a migratory child in its State has changed residence to a new local operating agency within the State or another SEA has approved a new Certificate of Eligibility for a migratory child, an SEA must collect and submit to MSIX all new MDEs and MDE updates that have become available to the SEA or one of its local operating agencies since the SEA's last submission of MDEs to MSIX for the child.</P>
              <P>(B) An SEA or local operating agency that does not yet have a new MDE or MDE update for a migratory child when it receives a change of residence notification from MSIX must submit the MDE to MSIX within four working days of the date that the SEA or one of its local operating agencies obtains the MDE.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of Consolidated Student Records.</E> In order to facilitate school enrollment, grade and course placement, accrual of high school credits, and participation in the MEP, each SEA that receives a grant of MEP funds must—</P>
              <P>(1) Use, and require each of its local operating agencies to use, the Consolidated Student Record for all migratory children who have changed residence to a new school district within the State or in another State;</P>
              <P>(2) Encourage LEAs that are not local operating agencies receiving MEP funds to use the Consolidated Student Record for all migratory children described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(3) Establish procedures, develop and disseminate guidance, and provide training in the use of Consolidated Student Records to SEA, local operating agency, and LEA personnel who have been designated by the SEA as authorized MSIX users under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">MSIX data quality.</E> Each SEA that receives a grant of MEP funds must—</P>
              <P>(1) Use, and require each of its local operating agencies to use, reasonable and appropriate methods to ensure that all data submitted to MSIX are accurate and complete; and</P>
              <P>(2) Respond promptly, and ensure that each of its local operating agencies responds promptly, to any request by the Department for information needed to meet the Department's responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of data in MSIX in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(6) and (g)(1)(C) or (D).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedures for MSIX data correction by parents, guardians, and migratory children.</E> Each SEA that receives a grant of MEP funds must establish and implement written procedures that <PRTPAGE P="417"/>allow a parent or guardian of a migratory child, or a migratory child, to ask the SEA to correct or determine the correctness of MSIX data. An SEA's written procedures must meet the following minimum requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Response to parents, guardians, and migratory children.</E> (i) Within 30 calendar days of receipt of a data correction request from a parent, guardian, or migratory child, an SEA must—</P>

              <P>(1) Training to ensure that recruiters and all other staff involved in determining eligibility and in conducting quality control procedures know the requirements for accurately determining and documenting child eligibility under the MEP.</P>

              <P>(2) Supervision and annual review and evaluation of the identification and recruitment practices of individual recruiters.<PRTPAGE P="420"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) A formal process for resolving eligibility questions raised by recruiters and their supervisors and for ensuring that this information is communicated to all local operating agencies.</P>
              <P>(4) An examination by qualified individuals at the SEA or local operating agency level of each COE to verify that the written documentation is sufficient and that, based on the recorded data, the child is eligible for MEP services.</P>
              <P>(5) A process for the SEA to validate that eligibility determinations were properly made, including conducting prospective re-interviewing as described in paragraph (b)(2).</P>
              <P>(6) Documentation that supports the SEA's implementation of this quality-control system and of a record of actions taken to improve the system where periodic reviews and evaluations indicate a need to do so.</P>
              <P>(7) A process for implementing corrective action if the SEA finds COEs that do not sufficiently document a child's eligibility for the MEP, or in response to internal State audit findings and recommendations, or monitoring or audit findings of the Secretary.</P>

                <P>An LEA that timely requests forgiveness has two overpayments of which portions remain owing on the date of its request—one of $200,000 and one of $300,000. Its preceding fiscal year's closing balance is $250,000 (before a revocable transfer to a capital outlay or debt service account); and 10 percent of its TCE for the preceding fiscal year is $150,000.</P>
                <P>The Secretary calculates the amount that the LEA must repay by determining the amount by which the preceding fiscal year's closing balance exceeds 10 percent of the preceding year's TCE. This calculation is made by subtracting 10 percent of the LEA's TCE ($150,000) from the closing balance ($250,000), resulting in a difference of $100,000 that the LEA must repay. The Secretary then totals the eligible overpayment amounts ($200,000 + $300,000), resulting in a total amount of $500,000. The Secretary subtracts the calculated repayment amount ($100,000) from the total of the two overpayment balances ($500,000), resulting in $400,000 that the Secretary forgives.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does the Secretary treat compensation from Federal activities for purposes of determining eligibility and payments?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An LEA with an otherwise approvable application is eligible to receive assistance under section 8002 for a fiscal year only if the LEA meets the requirements in subpart A of these regulations and § 222.21, and is not substantially compensated, for the loss in revenue resulting from Federal ownership of real property by increases in revenue accruing to the LEA during the previous fiscal year from Federal activities with respect to the eligible Federal property in the LEA.</P>

              <P>(1) The LEA received revenue during the preceding fiscal year that is generated from activities in or on the eligible Federal property; and</P>
              <P>(2) The revenue described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section equals or exceeds the maximum payment amount under section 8002(b) for the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance.</P>
              <P>(c) If an LEA described in paragraph (a) of this section received revenue described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section during the preceding fiscal year that, when added to the LEA's projected total section 8002 payment for the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance, exceeds the maximum payment amount under section 8002(b) for the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance, the Secretary reduces the LEA's projected section 8002 payment by an amount equal to that excess amount.</P>
              <P>(d) For purposes of this section, the amount of revenue that an LEA receives during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on Federal property includes payments received by any Federal agency due to activities on Federal property, including forestry, mining, and grazing, but does not include revenue from:</P>
              <P>(1) Payments received by the LEA from the Secretary of Defense to support—</P>
              <P>(i) The operation of a domestic dependent elementary or secondary school; or</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Documentation required.</E> In the first year of application following the consolidation, an LEA that meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section must submit evidence that it <PRTPAGE P="455"/>meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Basis for foundation payment.</E> (1) The foundation payment for a consolidated district is based on the total section 7002 payment for the last fiscal year for which the former LEA received payment. When more than one former LEA qualifies under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the payments for the last fiscal year for which the former LEAs received payment are added together to calculate the foundation basis.</P>

              <P>An applicant counts the membership of its federally connected children using one of the following methods:</P>

              <P>(a) Parent-pupil survey. An applicant may conduct a parent-pupil survey to <PRTPAGE P="457"/>count the membership of its federally connected children, which must be counted as of the survey date.</P>
              <P>(1) The applicant shall conduct a parent-pupil survey by providing a form to a parent of each pupil enrolled in the LEA to substantiate the pupil's place of residence and the parent's place of employment.</P>
              <P>(2) A parent-pupil survey form must include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Pupil enrollment information (this information may also be obtained from school records), including—</P>
              <P>(A) Name of pupil;</P>
              <P>(B) Date of birth of the pupil; and</P>
              <P>(C) Name of public school and grade of the pupil.</P>
              <P>(ii) Pupil residence information, including:</P>
              <P>(A) The complete address of the pupil's residence, or other acceptable location information for that residence, such as a complete legal description, a complete U.S. Geological Survey number, or complete property tract or parcel number, or acceptable certification by a Federal agency official with access to data or records to verify the location of the Federal property; and</P>
              <P>(B) If the pupil's residence is on Federal property, the name of the Federal facility.</P>
              <P>(3) If any of the following circumstances apply, the parent-pupil survey form must also include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) If the parent is employed on Federal property, except for a parent who is a member of the uniformed services on active duty, parent employment information, including—</P>

              <P>(A) Name (as it appears on the employer's payroll record) of the parent (mother, father, legal guardian or other person standing <E T="03">in loco parentis</E>) who is employed on Federal property and with whom the pupil resides; and</P>
              <P>(B) Name of employer, name and complete address of the Federal property on which the parent is employed (or other acceptable location information, such as a complete legal description or acceptable certification by a Federal agency).</P>
              <P>(ii) If the parent is a member of the uniformed services on active duty, the name, rank, and branch of service of that parent.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the parent is both an official of, and accredited by a foreign government, and a foreign military officer, the name, rank, and country of service.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the parent is a civilian employed on a Federal vessel, the name of the vessel, hull number, homeport, and name of the controlling agency.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) Every parent-pupil survey form must include the signature of the parent supplying the information, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, and the date of such signature, which must be on or after the survey date.</P>
              <P>(ii) An LEA may accept an unsigned parent-pupil survey form, or a parent-pupil survey form that is signed by a person other than a parent, only under unusual circumstances. In those instances, the parent-pupil survey form must show why the parent did not sign the survey form, and when, how, and from whom the residence and employment information was obtained. Unusual circumstances may include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(A) A pupil who, on the survey date, resided with a person without full legal guardianship of the child while the pupil's parent or parents were deployed for military duty. In this case, the person with whom the child is residing may sign the parent-pupil survey form.</P>
              <P>(B) A pupil who, on the survey date, was a ward of the juvenile justice system. In this case, an administrator of the institution where the pupil was held on the survey date may sign the parent-pupil survey form.</P>
              <P>(C) A pupil who, on the survey date, was an emancipated youth may sign his or her own parent-pupil survey form.</P>
              <P>(D) A pupil who, on the survey date, was at least 18 years old but who was not past the 12th grade may sign his or her own parent-pupil survey form.</P>

              <P>(iii) The Department does not accept a parent-pupil survey form signed by an employee of the school district who is not the student's mother, father, legal guardian or other person standing <E T="03">in loco parentis.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(b) Source check. A source check is a type of survey tool that groups children being claimed on the Impact Aid application by Federal property. This form is used in lieu of the parent-pupil <PRTPAGE P="458"/>survey form to substantiate a pupil's place of residence or parent's place of employment on the survey date.</P>
              <P>(1) The source check must include sufficient information to determine the eligibility of the Federal property and the individual children claimed on the form.</P>
              <P>(2) A source check may also include:</P>
              <P>(i) Certification by a parent's employer regarding the parent's place of employment;</P>
              <P>(ii) Certification by a military or other Federal housing official as to the residence of each pupil claimed;</P>

              <P>(a) This section describes how the Secretary computes the ADA of federally connected children for each category in section 8003 to determine an applicant's payment.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) For purposes of this section, actual ADA means raw ADA data that have not been weighted or adjusted to reflect higher costs for specific types of students for purposes of distributing State aid for education.</P>
              <P>(2) If an LEA provides a program of free public summer school, attendance data for the summer session are included in the LEA's ADA figure in accordance with State law or practice.</P>
              <P>(3) An LEA's ADA count includes attendance data for children who do not attend the LEA's schools, but for whom it makes tuition arrangements with other educational entities.</P>
              <P>(4) Data are not counted for any child—</P>
              <P>(i) Who is not physically present at school for the daily minimum time period required by the State, unless the child is—</P>
              <P>(A) Participating via telecommunication or correspondence course programs that meet State standards; or</P>
              <P>(B) Being served by a State-approved homebound instruction program for the daily minimum time period appropriate for the child; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Attending the applicant's schools under a tuition arrangement with another LEA.</P>
              <P>(c) An LEA may determine its average daily attendance calculation in one of the following ways:</P>

              <P>(1) If an LEA is in a State that collects actual ADA data for purposes of distributing State aid for education, the Secretary calculates the ADA of that LEA's federally connected children for the current fiscal year payment as follows:<PRTPAGE P="459"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) By dividing the ADA of all the LEA's children for the second preceding fiscal year by the LEA's total membership on its survey date for the second preceding fiscal year (or, in the case of an LEA that conducted two membership counts in the second preceding fiscal year, by the average of the LEA's total membership on the two survey dates); and</P>
              <P>(ii) By multiplying the figure determined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section by the LEA's total membership of federally connected children in each subcategory described in section 7003 and claimed in the LEA's application for the current fiscal year payment.</P>
              <P>(2) An LEA may submit its total preceding year ADA data. The Secretary uses these data to calculate the ADA of the LEA's federally connected children by—</P>
              <P>(i) Dividing the LEA's preceding year's total ADA data by the preceding year's total membership data; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiplying the figure determined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section by the LEA's total membership of federally connected children as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) An LEA may submit attendance data based on sampling conducted during the previous fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(i) The sampling must include attendance data for all children for at least 30 school days.</P>
              <P>(ii) The data must be collected during at least three periods evenly distributed throughout the school year.</P>
              <P>(iii) Each collection period must consist of at least five consecutive school days.</P>
              <P>(iv) The Secretary uses these data to calculate the ADA of the LEA's federally connected children by—</P>
              <P>(A) Determining the ADA of all children in the sample;</P>
              <P>(B) Dividing the figure obtained in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(A) of this section by the LEA's total membership for the previous fiscal year; and</P>
              <P>(C) Multiplying the figure determined in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B) of this section by the LEA's total membership of federally connected children for the current fiscal year, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) An SEA may submit data to calculate the average daily attendance calculation for the LEAs in that State in one of the following ways:</P>
              <P>(1) If the SEA distributes State aid for education based on data similar to attendance data, the SEA may request that the Secretary use those data to calculate the ADA of each LEA's federally connected children. If the Secretary determines that those data are, in effect, equivalent to attendance data, the Secretary allows use of the requested data and determines the method by which the ADA for all of the LEA's federally connected children will be calculated.</P>
              <P>(2) An SEA may submit data necessary for the Secretary to calculate a State average attendance ratio for all LEAs in the State by submitting the total ADA and total membership data for the State for each of the last three most recent fiscal years that ADA data were collected. The Secretary uses these data to calculate the ADA of the federally connected children for each LEA in the State by—</P>
              <P>(i)(A) Dividing the total ADA data by the total membership data for each of the three fiscal years and averaging the results; and</P>
              <P>(B) Multiplying the average determined in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section by the LEA's total membership of federally connected children as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) The Secretary may calculate a State average attendance ratio in States with LEAs that would benefit from such calculation by using the methodology in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) To identify generally comparable LEAs within its State for LCR purposes, the State educational agency (SEA) for that State, after appropriate consultation with the applicant LEAs in the State, shall use data from the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LCR is being computed to group all of its LEAs, including all applicant LEAs, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Grouping by grade span/legal classification alone.</E> Divide all LEAs into groups that serve the same grade span and then subdivide the grade span groups by legal classification, if the Secretary considers this classification relevant and sufficiently different from grade span within the State. As an alternative grade-span division, divide all LEAs into elementary, secondary, or unified grade-span groups, as appropriate, within the State.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Grouping by grade span/legal classification and size.</E> (i) Divide all LEAs into groups by grade span (or the alternative grade-span groups described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) and legal classification, if relevant and sufficiently different from grade span and size.</P>

              <P>(ii) List all LEAs within each group in descending order by size as measured by ADA, placing the LEA with the <E T="03">largest</E> ADA at the top of the list. A State that does not tabulate actual annual ADA shall use the same formula for establishing ADA for the purpose of ranking LEAs by size as the Department has approved for the purpose of calculating payments under section 8003 for applicant LEAs in the State.</P>
              <P>(iii) Divide each group into either two subgroups or three subgroups.</P>
              <P>(iv) To determine the subgroups, divide each list at the point(s) that will result in as nearly equal numbers of LEAs in each subgroup as possible, so that no group is more than one LEA larger than any other group.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Grouping by grade span/legal classification and location.</E> Divide all LEAs into groups by grade span (or the alternative grade-span groups described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) and, if relevant and sufficiently different from grade span and location, legal classification; then subdivide these groups by location, as determined by placement inside or outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The Department will supply SEAs with lists of MSA classifications for their LEAs, and only the classifications on those lists will be recognized by the Department for the purposes of these regulations.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Grouping by grade span/legal classification, size, and location.</E> (i) Divide all LEAs into groups by grade span (or the alternative grade-span groups described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) and, if relevant and sufficiently different from grade span, size, and location, legal classification; then subdivide these groups by size (into two or three subgroups for each grade span, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section); and further subdivide these groups by location (inside or outside an MSA).<PRTPAGE P="461"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) In using both the size and location factors, the SEA shall subdivide according to the size factor before the location factor.</P>
              <P>(b) After applying the following restrictions, the SEA shall compute an LCR according to the provisions of § 222.41 for each group of generally comparable LEAs identified under paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The SEA shall not, when computing an LCR, include the following “significantly impacted” LEAs in any group of generally comparable LEAs:</P>
              <P>(i) Any LEA having—in the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LCR is being computed—20 percent or more of its ADA composed of children identified under section 8003(a)(1)(A)-(C).</P>
              <P>(ii) Any LEA having—in the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LCR is being computed—50 percent or more of its ADA composed of children identified under section 8003(a)(1)(A)-(G) who were eligible under § 222.36 to be counted as the basis for payment under section 8003.</P>
              <P>(2) The SEA may not compute an LCR for any group that contains fewer than 10 LEAs.</P>
              <P>(c) The LCR for a “significantly impacted” LEA described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is the LCR of any group in which that LEA would be included based on grade span/legal classification, size, location, or a combination of these factors, if the LEA were not excluded as significantly impacted.</P>
              <P>(d) This section does not apply to applicant LEAs located in—</P>
              <P>(1) Puerto Rico;</P>
              <P>(2) Wake Island;</P>

                <P>An LEA applies for assistance under section 8003 and wishes to recommend to the Secretary an LCR based on generally comparable LEAs within its State.</P>
                <P>1. <E T="03">Characteristics of Applicant LEA.</E> The grade span of an applicant LEA is kindergarten through grade 8 (K-8). In the applicant's State, legal classification of LEAs is based on grade span, and thus does not act to further subdivide groups of LEAs.</P>
                <P>The ADA of the applicant LEA is above the median ADA of LEAs serving only K-8 in the State.</P>
                <P>The applicant LEA is located outside an MSA.</P>
                <P>2. <E T="03">Characteristics of Other LEAs Serving Same Grade Span.</E> The SEA of the applicant's State groups all LEAs in its State according to the factors in § 222.39.</P>
                <P>a. The SEA identifies the following groups:</P>
                <P>(i) One hundred and one LEAs serve only K-8. The SEA has identified a group of 50 LEAs having an ADA above the median ADA for the group of 101, one LEA having an ADA at the median, and a group of 50 LEAs having an ADA below the median ADA; and according to § 222.39(a)(2), the SEA considers 51 LEAs to have an ADA below the median ADA.</P>
                <P>(ii) Of the 101 LEAs in the group, the SEA has identified a group of 64 LEAs as being inside an MSA and a group of 37 LEAs as being outside an MSA.</P>
                <P>(iii) Among the group of 50 LEAs having an ADA above the median, the SEA has identified a group of 35 LEAs as being inside an MSA and a group of 15 LEAs as being outside an MSA.</P>
                <P>(iv) Among the group of 51 LEAs having an ADA at or below the median, the SEA has identified a group of 29 LEAs as being inside an MSA and 22 LEAs as being outside an MSA.</P>
                <P>(v) One LEA has 20 percent of its ADA composed of children identified under section 8003(a)(1)(A)-(C) and, therefore, must be excluded from any group it falls within before the SEA computes an LCR for the group. The LEA has an ADA below the median ADA and is located outside an MSA.</P>
                <P>b. On the basis of § 222.41, the SEA computes the LCR for each group of generally comparable LEAs that the SEA has identified.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What procedures does a State educational agency use for certain local educational agencies to determine generally comparable local educational agencies using additional factors, for local contribution rate purposes?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To use the procedures in this section, the applicant LEA, for the year of application, must either—</P>
              <P>(1)(i) Be located entirely on Federal land; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Be raising either no local revenues or an amount of local revenues the Secretary determines to be minimal; or<PRTPAGE P="462"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2)(i) Be located in a State where State aid makes up no more than 40 percent of the State average per pupil expenditure in the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LCR is being computed;</P>
              <P>(ii) In its application, have federally connected children identified under section 8003(a)(1)(A)-(C) equal to at least 20 percent of its total ADA; and</P>
              <P>(iii) In its application, have federally connected children identified under section 8003(a)(1)(A)-(G) who were eligible to be counted as the basis for payment under section 8003 equal to at least 50 percent of its total ADA.</P>
              <P>(b) If requested by an applicant LEA described in paragraph (a) of this section, the SEA follows the procedures in this section, in consultation with the LEA, to determine generally comparable LEAs using additional factors for the purpose of calculating and certifying an LCR for that LEA.</P>
              <P>(c) The SEA identifies—</P>
              <P>(1) The subgroup of generally comparable LEAs from the group identified under § 222.39(a)(2) (grouping by grade span/legal classification and size) that includes the applicant LEA; or</P>
              <P>(2) For an LEA described in paragraph (a) of this section that serves a different span of grades from all other LEAs in its State (and therefore cannot match any group of generally comparable LEAs under § 222.39(a)(2)), for purposes of this section only, a group using only legal classification and size as measured by ADA.</P>
              <P>(d) From the subgroup described in paragraph (c) of this section, the SEA then identifies 10 or more generally comparable LEAs that share one or more additional common factors of general comparability with the applicant LEA described in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) The SEA must consider one or more generally accepted, objectively defined factors that affect the applicant's cost of educating its children. Examples of such cost-related factors include location inside or outside an MSA, an unusually large geographical area or an economically depressed area, sparsity or density of population, and the percentage of its students who are from low-income families or who are children with disabilities, neglected or delinquent children, low-achieving children, or children with limited English proficiency.</P>
              <P>(ii) The SEA may not consider cost-related factors that can be varied at the discretion of the applicant LEA or its generally comparable LEAs or factors dependent on the wealth of the applicant LEA or its generally comparable LEAs. Examples of factors that may not be considered include special alternative curricular programs, pupil-teacher ratio, and per pupil expenditures.</P>
              <P>(iii) If an SEA proposes to use one or more special additional factors to determine generally comparable LEAs, the SEA must submit, with its annual submission of generally comparable data to the Department, its rationale for selecting the additional factor or factors and describe how they affect the cost of education in the LEA.</P>
              <P>(2) The SEA applies the factor or factors of general comparability identified under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section in one of the following ways in order to identify 10 or more generally comparable LEAs for the eligible applicant LEA, none of which may be significantly impacted LEAs:</P>

              <P>(i) The SEA identifies all of the LEAs in the group to which the eligible applicant LEA belongs under § 222.39(a)(2) that share the factor or factors. If the subgroup containing the eligible applicant LEA includes at least 10 other LEAs (excluding significantly impacted LEAs), it will be the eligible applicant LEA's new group of generally comparable LEAs. The SEA computes the LCR for the eligible applicant LEA using the data for all of the LEAs in the subgroup except the eligible applicant LEA.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                <P>An eligible applicant LEA contains a designated economically depressed area, and the SEA, in consultation with the LEA, identifies “economically depressed area” as an additional factor of general comparability. From the group of LEAs under § 222.39(a)(2) that includes the eligible applicant LEA, the SEA identifies two subgroups, those LEAs that contain a designated economically depressed area and those that do not. The entire subgroup identified by the SEA that includes the eligible applicant LEA is that LEA's new group of generally comparable LEAs if it contains at least 10 LEAs.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <PRTPAGE P="463"/>

              <P>(ii) After the SEA identifies all of the LEAs in the group to which the eligible applicant LEA belongs under § 222.39(a)(2) that share the factor or factors, the SEA then systematically orders by ADA all of the LEAs in the group that includes the eligible applicant LEA. The SEA may further divide the ordered LEAs into subgroups by using logical division points (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the median, quartiles, or standard deviations) or a continuous interval of the ordered LEAs (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a percentage or a numerical range). If the subgroup containing the eligible applicant LEA includes at least 10 other LEAs (excluding significantly impacted LEAs), it will be the eligible applicant LEA's new group of generally comparable LEAs. The SEA computes the LCR for the eligible applicant LEA using the data for all of the LEAs in the subgroup except the eligible applicant LEA.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                <P>An eligible applicant LEA serves an unusually high percentage of children with disabilities, and the SEA, in consultation with the LEA, identifies “proportion of children with disabilities” as an additional comparability factor. From the group of LEAs under § 222.39(a)(2) that includes the eligible applicant LEA, the SEA lists the LEAs in descending order according to the percentage of children with disabilities enrolled in each of the LEAs. The SEA divides the list of LEAs into four groups containing equal numbers of LEAs. The group containing the eligible applicant LEA is that LEA's new group of generally comparable LEAs if it contains at least 10 LEAs.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              

              <P>(iii) The SEA may apply more than one factor of general comparability in identifying a new group of 10 or more generally comparable LEAs for the eligible applicant LEA. If the subgroup containing the eligible applicant LEA includes at least 10 other LEAs (excluding significantly impacted LEAs), it will be the eligible applicant LEA's new group of generally comparable LEAs. The SEA computes the LCR for the eligible applicant LEA using the data from all of the LEAs in the subgroup except the eligible applicant LEA.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3.</HD>
                <P>An eligible applicant LEA is very sparsely populated and serves an unusually high percentage of children with limited English proficiency. The SEA, in consultation with the LEA, identifies “sparsity of population” and “proportion of children with limited English proficiency” as additional comparability factors. From the group of LEAs under § 222.39(a)(2) that includes the eligible applicant LEA, the SEA identifies all LEAs that are sparsely populated. The SEA further subdivides the sparsely populated LEAs into two groups, those that serve an unusually high percentage of children with limited English proficiency and those that do not. The subgroup of at least 10 sparsely populated LEAs that serve a high percentage of children with limited English proficiency is the eligible applicant LEA's new group of generally comparable LEAs.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(e)(1) Using the new group of generally comparable LEAs selected under paragraph (d) of this section, the SEA computes the LCR for the eligible applicant LEA according to the provisions of § 222.41.</P>
              <P>(2) The SEA certifies the resulting LCR by submitting that LCR to the Secretary and providing the Secretary a description of the additional factor or factors of general comparability and the data used to identify the new group of generally comparable LEAs.</P>
              <P>(3) The Secretary reviews the data submitted by the SEA, and accepts the LCR for the purpose of use under section 8003(b)(1)(C)(iii) in determining the LEA's maximum payment under section 8003 if the Secretary determines that it meets the purposes and requirements of the Act and this part.</P>

              <P>An LEA is eligible for financial assistance under section 8003(b)(1)(F) if the Secretary determines that the LEA meets all of the following requirements—</P>
              <P>(a)(1) The LEA is eligible for a basic support payment under section 8003(b), including meeting the maintenance of effort requirements in section 8003(g) of the Act;</P>
              <P>(2) The LEA timely applies for assistance under section 8003(b)(1)(F) and meets all other requirements of subparts A and C;</P>
              <P>(3) The LEA is meeting the tax rate requirement in § 222.68(c) and the other applicable requirements of §§ 222.68 through 222.72; and</P>
              <P>(4) The LEA is not in a State that takes the LEA's payment under section 8003(b)(1)(F) into account in an equalization program that qualifies under section 8009 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) As part of its section 8003 application, the LEA indicates in writing that it wishes to apply for an “unusual geographic” payment and it will provide the Secretary with documentation upon request that demonstrates that the LEA is unable to provide a level of education equivalent to that provided by its generally comparable LEAs because—</P>
              <P>(i) The applicant's current expenditures are affected by unusual geographic factors; and</P>

              <P>(i) If section 8003(d) funds are used for the acquisition of any equipment described in this paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the fair market value of any financial advantage realized through rebates, discounts, bonuses, free pieces of equipment used in a program or project for the free appropriate public education of, or early intervention services for, federally connected children with disabilities, or other circumstances, is not an allowable expenditure and may not be credited as an expenditure of those funds.</P>
              <P>(ii) Funds awarded under the provisions of section 8003(d) may be used to acquire equipment for the free appropriate public education of, or early intervention services for, the federally connected children with disabilities only if title to the equipment would be in the applicant agency.</P>
              <P>(d) An LEA shall account for the use of section 8003(d) funds as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) By recording, for each fiscal year, the receipt (or credit) of section 8003(d) funds separately from other funds received under the Act, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, on a line item basis in the general fund account or in a separate account; and</P>
              <P>(2) By demonstrating that, for each fiscal year, the amount of expenditures for special education and related services and for early intervention services provided to the federally connected children with disabilities is at least equal to the amount of section 8003(d) funds received or credited for that fiscal year. This is done as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) For each fiscal year determine the amount of an LEA's expenditures for special education and related services and for early intervention services provided to all children with disabilities.</P>

              <P>(ii) The amount determined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is divided by the average daily attendance (ADA) of the total number of children with <PRTPAGE P="467"/>disabilities the LEA served during that fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(iii) The amount determined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is then multiplied by the total ADA of the LEA's federally connected children with disabilities claimed by the LEA for that fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(3) If the amount of section 8003(d) funds the LEA received (or was credited) for the fiscal year exceeds the amount obtained in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, an overpayment equal to the excess section 8003(d) funds is established. This overpayment may be reduced or eliminated to the extent that the LEA can demonstrate that the average per pupil expenditure for special education and related services and for early intervention services provided to federally connected children with disabilities exceeded its average per pupil expenditure for serving non-federally connected children with disabilities.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What supplement-not-supplant requirement applies to this subpart?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Funds provided under section 8003(d) may not supplant any State funds that were or would have been available to the LEA for the free appropriate public education of children counted under section 8003(d).</P>
              <P>(a) No section 8003(d) funds may be paid to an LEA whose per pupil State aid for federally connected children with disabilities, either general State aid or special education State aid, has been or would be reduced as a result of eligibility for or receipt of section 8003(d) funds, whether or not a State has a program of State aid that meets the requirements of section 8009 of the Act and subpart K of the regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(1) A reduction in the per pupil amount of State aid for children with disabilities, including children counted under section 8003(d), from that received in a previous year raises a presumption that supplanting has occurred.</P>
              <P>(2) The LEA may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the reduction was unrelated to the receipt of section 8003(d) funds.</P>
              <P>(b) In any State in which there is only one LEA, all funds for programs, and for early intervention services, for children with disabilities other than funds from Federal sources are considered by the Secretary to be local funds.</P>

              <P>(a) Computations and determinations made with regard to an LEA's eligibility under section 8003(b)(2) in §§ 222.61 through 222.66 of these regulations are based on the LEA's final student, revenue, expenditure, and tax data from the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which it seeks assistance.</P>

              <P>(c) As used in this subpart, the phrase “tax rate for general fund purposes” means “local real property tax rates for current expenditures purposes” as defined in § 222.2. “Current expenditures” is defined in section 8013(4) of the ESEA.</P>

                <P>In Federal Fiscal Years (FFYs) 1 and 2, a continuing LEA is eligible for a section 8003(b)(2) payment. In FFY 3, the LEA applies but is ineligible for section 8003(b)(2). However, it will still receive a payment under section 8003(b)(2) for FFY 3 (a “hold harmless” payment under § 222.66(a)). For FFY 4, the LEA applies and meets the requirements. The LEA is not eligible to receive a section 8003(b)(2) payment in FFY 4 but is instead eligible for a section 8003(b)(1) payment (see § 222.66(b)). In FFY 5, the LEA applies, meets the requirements, and receives a section 8003(b)(2) payment. The LEA not only must apply one year in advance and meet the section 8003(b)(2) requirements (FFY 4) but it must apply and meet the requirements for the subsequent FFY (year 5).

                <P>A new LEA applies for a section 8003(b)(2) payment and meets the applicable eligibility criteria. The LEA does not receive a section 8003(b)(2) payment in FFY 1 and it must apply and meet the requirements again in FFY 2 before it can receive a (b)(2) payment (see § 222.62(b)). If that new district is then ineligible for a year, it can regain eligibility only if it meets the applicable criteria in a subsequent year. For example, if a new LEA loses its section 8003(b)(2) eligibility in FFY 3 because its tax rate dropped to 94 percent of the average tax rate of comparable districts in the State, that LEA is still entitled to receive a payment under section 8003(b)(2) in FFY 3 if it applies for such payment (a “hold harmless” payment under § 222.66(a)). Then if the LEA applies in FFY 4 and meets the eligibility requirement under section 8003(b)(2), it is once again eligible to receive a section 8003(b)(2) payment (see § 222.66(c)).

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Filing requirements.</E> (1) All written submissions must be filed with the hearing examiner by hand-delivery, mail, or facsimile transmission. The Secretary discourages the use of facsimile transmission for documents longer than five pages.</P>

                <P>(i) In whole or in part in writing; or</P>
                <P>(ii) In an informal conference after affording each party sufficient notice of the issues to be considered.</P>
                <P>(2) With respect to withholding hearings involving a dispute as to a material fact the resolution of which would be materially assisted by oral testimony, the hearing examiner shall afford to each party—</P>
                <P>(i) Sufficient notice of the issues to be considered at the hearing;</P>
                <P>(ii) An opportunity to present witnesses on the party's behalf; and</P>
                <P>(iii) An opportunity to cross-examine other witnesses either orally or through written interrogatories.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rules.</E> (1) A State may take into consideration payments under sections 8002 and 8003(b) of the Act (including hold harmless payments calculated under section 8003(e)) in allocating State aid if that State has a State aid program that qualifies under § 222.162, except as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Those payments may be taken into consideration for each affected local educational agency (LEA) only in the proportion described in § 222.163.</P>
              <P>(ii) A State may not take into consideration—</P>
              <P>(A) That portion of an LEA's payment that is generated by the portion of a weight in excess of one under section 8003(a)(2)(B) of the Act (children residing on Indian lands);</P>
              <P>(B) Payments under section 8003(d) of the Act (children with disabilities); or</P>
              <P>(C) The amount that an LEA receives under section 8003(b)(2) that exceeds the amount the LEA would receive if eligible under section 8003(b)(1) and not section 8003(b)(2) (heavily impacted LEAs).</P>
              <P>(2) No State aid program may qualify under this subpart if a court of that State has determined by final order, not under appeal, that the program fails to equalize expenditures for free public education among LEAs within the State or otherwise violates law, and if the court's order provides that the program is no longer in effect.</P>
              <P>(3) No State, whether or not it has an equalization program that qualifies under § 222.162, may, in allocating State aid, take into consideration an LEA's eligibility for payments under the Act if that LEA does not apply for and receive those payments.</P>

              <P>(4) Any State that takes into consideration payments under the Act in accordance with the provisions of section 8009 in allocating State aid to LEAs must reimburse any LEA for any amounts taken into consideration for any fiscal year to the extent that the LEA did not in fact receive payments in those amounts during that fiscal year.<PRTPAGE P="486"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6), a State may not take into consideration payments under the Act in making estimated or final State aid payments before its State aid program has been certified by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(6)(i) If the Secretary has not made a determination under section 7009 of the Act for a fiscal year, the State may request permission from the Secretary to make estimated or preliminary State aid payments for that fiscal year, that consider a portion of Impact Aid payments as local resources in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The State must include with its request an assurance that if the Secretary determines that the State does not meet the requirements of section 222.162 for that State fiscal year, the State must pay to each affected LEA, within 60 days of the Secretary's determination, the amount by which the State reduced State aid to the LEA.</P>
              <P>(iii) In determining whether to grant permission, the Secretary may consider factors including whether—</P>
              <P>(A) The Secretary certified the State under § 222.162 in the prior State fiscal year; and</P>
              <P>(B) Substantially the same State aid program is in effect since the date of the last certification.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Data for determinations.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, determinations under this subpart requiring the submission of financial or school population data must be made on the basis of final data for the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made if substantially the same program was then in effect.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) If the Secretary determines that the State has substantially revised its State aid program, the Secretary may certify that program for any fiscal year only if—</P>
              <P>(A) The Secretary determines, on the basis of projected data, that the State's program will meet the disparity standard described in § 222.162 for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; and</P>
              <P>(B) The State provides an assurance to the Secretary that, if final data do not demonstrate that the State's program met that standard for the fiscal year for which the determination is made, the State will pay to each affected LEA the amount by which the State reduced State aid to the LEA.</P>
              <P>(ii) Data projections submitted by a State must set forth the assumptions upon which the data projections are founded, be accompanied by an assurance as to their accuracy, and be adjusted by actual data for the fiscal year of determination that must be submitted to the Secretary as soon as these data are available.</P>
              <P>(3) For a State that has not previously been certified by the Secretary under § 222.162, or if the last certification was more than two years prior, the State submits projected data showing whether it meets the disparity standard in § 222.162. The projected data must show the resulting amounts of State aid as if the State were certified to consider Impact Aid in making State aid payments.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to this subpart:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Current expenditures</E> is defined in section 7013(4) of the Act.

              <P>
                <E T="03">Local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program</E> means “local tax revenues” as defined in paragraph (c) of this section contributed to or <PRTPAGE P="487"/>taken into consideration in a State aid program subject to a determination under this subpart, but excluding all revenues from State and Federal sources.</P>
              <P>

              <SUBJECT>What disparity standard must a State meet in order to be certified and how are disparities in current expenditures or revenues per pupil measured?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Percentage disparity limitation.</E> The Secretary considers that a State aid program equalizes expenditures if the disparity in the amount of current expenditures or revenues per pupil for free public education among LEAs in the State is no more than 25 percent. In determining the disparity percentage, the Secretary disregards LEAs with per pupil expenditures or revenues above the 95th or below the 5th percentile of those expenditures or revenues in the State. The method for calculating the percentage of disparity in a State is in the appendix to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">Weighted average disparity for different grade level groups.</E> If a State requests it, the Secretary will make separate disparity computations for different groups of LEAs in the State that have similar grade levels of instruction.</P>
              <P>(2) In those cases, the weighted average disparity for all groups, based on the proportionate number of pupils in each group, may not be more than the percentage provided in paragraph (a) of this section. The method for calculating the weighted average disparity percentage is set out in the appendix to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Per pupil figure computations.</E> In calculating the current expenditures or revenue disparities under this section, computations of per pupil figures are made on one of the following bases:</P>
              <P>(1) The per pupil amount of current expenditures or revenue for an LEA is computed on the basis of the total number of pupils receiving free public education in the schools of the agency. The total number of pupils is determined in accordance with whatever standard measurement of pupil count is used in the State.</P>
              <P>(2) If a State aid program uses “weighted pupil,” “classroom,” “instructional unit,” or another designated measure of need in determining allocations of State aid to take account of special cost differentials, the computation of per pupil revenue or current expenditures may be made using one of the methods in paragraph (d) of this section. The two allowable categories of special cost differentials are—</P>
              <P>(i) Those associated with pupils having special educational needs, such as children with disabilities, economically disadvantaged children, non-English speaking children, and gifted and talented children; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Those associated with particular types of LEAs such as those affected by geographical isolation, sparsity or density of population, high cost of living, or special socioeconomic characteristics within the area served by an LEA.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Accounting for special cost differentials.</E> In computing per-pupil figures under paragraph (c) of this section, the State accounts for special cost differentials that meet the requirements <PRTPAGE P="488"/>of paragraph (c)(2) of this section in one of four ways:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">The inclusion method on a revenue basis.</E> The State divides total revenues by a weighted pupil count that includes only those weights associated with the special cost differentials.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">The inclusion method on an expenditure basis.</E> The State divides total current expenditures by a weighted pupil count that includes only those weights associated with the special cost differentials.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">The exclusion method on a revenue basis.</E> The State subtracts revenues associated with the special cost differentials from total revenues, and divides this net amount by an unweighted pupil count.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">The exclusion method on an expenditure basis.</E> The State subtracts current expenditures from revenues associated with the special cost differentials from total current expenditures, and divides this net amount by an unweighted pupil count.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Provision of law.</E> Section 8009(d)(1)(B) provides that, upon certification by the Secretary, in allocating State aid a State may consider as local resources funds received under sections 8002 and 8003(b) (including hold harmless payments calculated under section 8003(e)) only in proportion to the share that local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program are of total local tax revenues. Determinations of proportionality must be made on a case-by-case basis for each LEA affected and not on the basis of a general rule to be applied throughout a State.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of proportion.</E> (1) In computing the share that local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program are of total local tax revenues for an LEA with respect to a program qualifying under § 222.162, the proportion is obtained by dividing the amount of local tax revenues covered under the equalization program by the total local tax revenues attributable to current expenditures for free public education within that LEA.</P>
              <P>(2) In cases where there are no local tax revenues for current expenditures and the State provides all of those revenues on behalf of the LEA, the State may consider up to 100 percent of the funds received under the Act by that LEA in allocating State aid.</P>

              <P>(2) Whenever a proceeding under this subpart is initiated, the party initiating the proceeding shall provide either the State or all LEAs with a complete copy of the submission required in paragraph (b) of this section. Following receipt of the submission, the Secretary shall notify the State and all LEAs in the State of their right to request from the Secretary, within 30 days of the initiation of a proceeding, the opportunity to present their views to the Secretary before the Secretary makes a determination.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission.</E> (1) A submission by a State or LEA under this section must be made in the manner requested by <PRTPAGE P="489"/>the Secretary and must contain the information and assurances as may be required by the Secretary in order to reach a determination under section 8009 and this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) A State in a submission shall—</P>
              <P>(A) Demonstrate how its State aid program comports with § 222.162; and</P>
              <P>(B) Demonstrate for each LEA receiving funds under the Act that the proportion of those funds that will be taken into consideration comports with § 222.163.</P>
              <P>(ii) The submission must be received by the Secretary no later than 120 calendar days before the beginning of the State's fiscal year for the year of the determination, and must include (except as provided in § 222.161(c)(2)) final second preceding fiscal year disparity data enabling the Secretary to determine whether the standard in § 222.162 has been met. The submission is considered timely if received by the Secretary on or before the filing deadline or if it bears a U.S. Postal Service postmark dated on or before the filing deadline.</P>
              <P>(3) An LEA in a submission must demonstrate whether the State aid program comports with section 8009.</P>
              <P>(4) Whenever a proceeding is initiated under this subpart, the Secretary may request from a State the data deemed necessary to make a determination. A failure on the part of a State to comply with that request within a reasonable period of time results in a summary determination by the Secretary that the State aid program of that State does not comport with the regulations in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) Before making a determination under section 8009, the Secretary affords the State, and all LEAs in the State, an opportunity to present their views as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Upon receipt of a timely request for a predetermination hearing, the Secretary notifies all LEAs and the State of the time and place of the predetermination hearing.</P>
              <P>(ii) Predetermination hearings are informal and any LEA and the State may participate whether or not they requested the predetermination hearing.</P>
              <P>(iii) At the conclusion of the predetermination hearing, the Secretary holds the record open for 15 days for the submission of post-hearing comments. The Secretary may extend the period for post-hearing comments for good cause for up to an additional 15 days.</P>
              <P>(iv) Instead of a predetermination hearing, if the party or parties requesting the predetermination hearing agree, they may present their views to the Secretary exclusively in writing. In such a case, the Secretary notifies all LEAs and the State that this alternative procedure is being followed and that they have up to 30 days from the date of the notice in which to submit their views in writing. Any LEA or the State may submit its views in writing within the specified time, regardless of whether it requested the opportunity to present its views.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determinations.</E> The Secretary reviews the participants' submissions and any views presented at a predetermination hearing under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, including views submitted during the post-hearing comment period. Based upon this review, the Secretary issues a written determination setting forth the reasons for the determination in sufficient detail to enable the State or LEAs to respond. The Secretary affords reasonable notice of a determination under this subpart and the opportunity for a hearing to the State or any LEA adversely affected by the determination.</P>

              <P>The following paragraphs describe the methods for making certain calculations in conjunction with determinations made under the regulations in this subpart. Except as otherwise provided in the regulations, these methods are the only methods that may be used in making these calculations.</P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Determinations of disparity standard compliance under § 222.162(b)(1).</E>
              </P>
              <P>(a) The determinations of disparity in current expenditures or revenue per pupil are made by—</P>
              <P>(i) Ranking all LEAs having similar grade levels within the State on the basis of current expenditures or revenue per pupil for the second preceding fiscal year before the year of determination;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identifying those LEAs in each ranking that fall at the 95th and 5th percentiles of the total number of pupils in attendance in the schools of those LEAs; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Subtracting the lower current expenditure or revenue per pupil figure from the higher for those agencies identified in paragraph (ii) and dividing the difference by the lower figure.</P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>In State X, after ranking all LEAs organized on a grade 9-12 basis in order of the expenditures per pupil for the fiscal year in question, it is ascertained by counting the number of pupils in attendance in those agencies in ascending order of expenditure that the 5th percentile of student population is reached at LEA A with a per pupil expenditure of $820, and that the 95th percentile of student population is reached at LEA B with a per pupil expenditure of $1,000. The percentage disparity between the 95th and 5th percentile LEAs is 22 percent ($1,000-$820 = $180/$820). The program would meet the disparity standard for fiscal years before fiscal year 1998 but would not for subsequent years.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <P>(b) In cases under § 222.162(b), where separate computations are made for different groups of LEAs, the disparity percentage for each group is obtained in the manner described in paragraph (a) above. Then the weighted average disparity percentage for the State as a whole is determined by—</P>
              <P>(i) Multiplying the disparity percentage for each group by the total number of pupils receiving free public education in the schools in that group;</P>
              <P>(ii) Summing the figures obtained in paragraph (b)(i); and</P>
              <P>(iii) Dividing the sum obtained in paragraph (b)(ii) by the total number of pupils for all the groups.</P>

                <P>State A has an equalization program under which each LEA is guaranteed $900 per pupil less the LEA contribution based on a uniform tax levy. The LEA contribution from the uniform tax levy is considered under the equalization program. LEA X contributes the proceeds of the uniform tax levy, $700 per pupil, and the State contributes the $200 difference. No other local tax revenues are applied to current expenditures for education by LEA X.

If LEA X receives $100 per pupil in payments under the Act, $100 per pupil may be taken into consideration by State A in determining LEA X's relative financial resources and needs under the program. LEA X is regarded as contributing $800 and State A would now contribute the $100 difference.</P>

                <P>The initial facts are the same as in Example 1, except that LEA X, under a permissible additional levy outside the equalization program, raises an additional $100 per pupil not covered under the equalization program. The permissible levy is not included in local tax revenues covered under the equalization program but it is included in total local tax revenues. The percentage of payments under the Act that may be taken into consideration is 87.5 percent ($700/$800). If LEA X receives $100 per pupil in payments under the Act, $87.50 per pupil may be taken into consideration. LEA X is now regarded as contributing $787.50 per pupil under the program and State A would now contribute $112.50 per pupil as the difference.</P>

The percentage of funds under the Act that may be taken into consideration by State A for LEA X is 100 percent ($700/$700). The local revenue received from interest, bake sales, in-kind contributions and other non-tax local revenues are excluded from the computation since they are from non-tax sources.

                <P>State C has an equalization program in which each participating LEA is guaranteed a certain per pupil revenue at various levels of tax rates. For an eight mill rate the guarantee is $500, for nine mills $550, for 10 mills $600. LEA X levies a 10 mill rate and realizes $300 per pupil. Furthermore, it levies an additional 10 mills under a local leeway option realizing another $300 per pupil. The $300 proceeds of the local leeway option are not included in local tax revenues covered under the equalization program, but they are included in total local tax revenues. The percentage of payments under the Act that may be taken into consideration is 50 percent ($300/$600). If LEA X receives $100 per pupil in payments under the Act, $50 per pupil may be taken into consideration. LEA X may be regarded as contributing $350 per pupil under the program and State B would now contribute $250 as the difference.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 5.</HD>
                <P>The initial facts are the same as in Example 4, except that LEA Y in State C, while taxing at the same 10 mill rate for both the equalization program and leeway allowance as LEA X, realizes $550 per pupil for each tax. As with LEA X, the percentage of payments under the Act that may be taken into consideration for LEA Y is 50 percent (550/1100). If LEA Y receives $150 per pupil in payments under the Act, then up to $75 per pupil normally could be taken into consideration. However, since LEA Y would have received only $50 per pupil in State aid, only $50 of the allowable $75 could be taken into consideration. Thus, LEA Z may be regarded as contributing $600 per pupil under the program and State B would not contribute any State aid.</P>

                <P>Grant funds under this program may not be used to supplant or replace other available non-Federal construction money. These grant funds may be used for emergency or modernization activities only to the extent that they supplement the amount of construction funds that would, in the absence of these grant funds, be available to a grantee from non-Federal funds for these purposes.

                  <P>An LEA signs a contract for a $300,000 roof replacement and plans to use its capital expenditure fund to pay for the renovation. Since the LEA already has non-Federal funds available for the roof project, it may not now use a grant from this program to pay for the project or replace its own funds in order to conserve its capital fund.</P>

                  <P>The LEA from the example of supplanting that has the $300,000 roof commitment has also received a $400,000 estimate for the replacement of its facility's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The LEA has not made any commitments for the HVAC system because it has no remaining funds available to pay for that work. Since other funds are not available, it would not be supplanting if the LEA received an emergency grant under this program to pay for the HVAC system.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What funding priority does the Secretary give to applications?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary gives funding priority to applications in the following order:</P>
                <P>(1) First priority is given to applications described under § 222.177 and, among those applicants for emergency grants, priority is given to applications based on a rank order of the application quality factors referenced in § 222.190, including the severity of the emergency.</P>
                <P>(2) After all eligible first-priority applications are funded, second priority is given to applications described under §§ 222.178 and 222.179 and, among those applicants for emergency grants, priority is given to applications based on a rank order of the application quality factors referenced in § 222.190, including the severity of the emergency.</P>

                <P>(3) Third priority is given to applications described under § 222.180 and, <PRTPAGE P="499"/>among those applicants for modernization grants, priority is given to applications based on a rank order of the application quality factors referenced in § 222.190, including the severity of the need for modernization.</P>
                <P>(4) Fourth priority is given to applications described under §§ 222.181 and 222.182 and, among those applicants for modernization grants, priority is given to applications based on a rank order of the application quality factors referenced in § 222.190, including the severity of the need for modernization.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) The Secretary makes awards in each priority described above until the Secretary is unable to make an approvable award in that priority.</P>
                <P>(2) If the Secretary is unable to fund a full project or a viable portion of a project, the Secretary may continue to fund down the list of high-ranking applicants within a priority.</P>
                <P>(3) The Secretary applies any remaining funds to awards in the next priority.</P>

                <P>(4) If an applicant does not receive an emergency or modernization grant in a fiscal year, the Secretary will, subject to the availability of funds and to the priority and award criteria, consider that application in the following year along with the next fiscal year's pool of applications.

                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                  <P>The first five applicants in priority one have been funded. Three hundred thousand dollars remain available. Three unfunded applications remain in that priority. Application #6 requires a minimum of $500,000, application #7 requires $400,000, and application #8 requires $300,000 for a new roof and $150,000 for related wall and ceiling repairs. Applicant #8 agrees to accept the remaining $300,000 since the roof upgrade can be separated into a viable portion of applicant #8's total project. Applications #6 and #7 will be retained for consideration in the next fiscal year and will compete again with that fiscal year's pool of applicants. Applicant #8 will have to submit a new application in the next fiscal year if it wishes to be considered for the unfunded portion of the current year's application.</P>

                </P>
                <P>(b) In the event of ties in numeric ranking, the Secretary may consider as tie-breaking factors: the severity of the emergency or the need for modernization; for applicants under section 8003 of the Act, the numbers of federally connected children who will benefit from the project; or for applicants under section 8002 of the Act, the numbers of children who will benefit from the project; the AVPP compared to the LEA's State average; and available resources or non-Federal funds available for the grant project.</P>

                <P>To determine the amount of local funds that an LEA has available under § 222.191(b)(2) for a project under this program, the Secretary will consider as available all LEA funds that may be used for capital expenditures except $100,000 or 10 percent of the average annual capital expenditures of the applicant for the three previous fiscal years, whichever is greater. The Secretary will not consider capital funds that an <PRTPAGE P="500"/>LEA can demonstrate have been committed through signed contracts or other written binding agreements but have not yet been expended.</P>

              <P>(2) The cash payback required shall be equivalent to the total amount of funds received and expended for training received under this program and may be prorated based on any approved work-related service the participant performs.</P>

              <P>(3) Participants who are referred to cash payback may incur non-refundable penalty and administrative fees in addition to their total training costs and will incur interest charges starting the day of referral.<PRTPAGE P="514"/>

              <SUBJECT>What maintenance of effort requirements apply to ESEA programs?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> An LEA receiving funds under an applicable program listed in paragraph (b) of this section may receive its full allocation of funds only if the SEA finds that either the combined fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures of State and local funds with respect to the provision of free public education in the LEA for the preceding fiscal year was not less than 90 percent of the combined fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures for the second preceding fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicable programs.</E> This subpart is applicable to the following programs:</P>
              <P>(1) Part A of title I (Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies).</P>
              <P>(2) Part D of title I (Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth Who Are Neglected, Delinquent, or At Risk).</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Meaning of “preceding fiscal year”.</E> For purposes of determining if the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section is met, the “preceding fiscal year” means the Federal fiscal year, or the 12-month fiscal period most commonly used in a State for official reporting purposes, prior to the beginning of the Federal fiscal year in which funds are available for obligation by the Department.
              </P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Example.</E> For fiscal year 2018 funds that are first made available on July 1, 2018, if a State is using the Federal fiscal year, the “preceding fiscal year” is Federal fiscal year 2017 (which began on October 1, 2016 and ended September 30, 2017) and the “second preceding fiscal year” is Federal fiscal year 2016 (which began on October 1, 2015). If a State is using a fiscal year that begins on July 1, 2018, the “preceding fiscal year” is the 12-month period ending on June 30, 2017, and the “second preceding fiscal year” is the period ending on June 30, 2016.</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Expenditures.</E> (1) In determining an LEA's compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, the SEA shall consider only the LEA's expenditures from State and local funds for free public education. These include expenditures for administration, instruction, attendance and health services, pupil transportation services, operation and maintenance of plant, fixed charges, and net expenditures to cover deficits for food services and student body activities.</P>
              <P>(2) The SEA may not consider the following expenditures in determining an LEA's compliance with the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) Any expenditures for community services, capital outlay, debt service or supplemental expenses made as a result of a Presidentially declared disaster.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any expenditures made from funds provided by the Federal Government.</P>
