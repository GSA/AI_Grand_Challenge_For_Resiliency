      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              (d) Each application shall specify the type or types of service (passengers, property or mail) to be rendered and whether such services are to be rendered on scheduled or charter operations.
              (e) Each application for foreign scheduled air transportation shall include an adequate identification of each route for which a certificate is desired, including the terminal and intermediate points to be included in the certificate for which application is made.
              (f) Each application shall give full and adequate information with respect to each of the relevant filing requirements set forth in part 204 of this chapter. In addition, the application may contain such other information and data as the applicant shall deem necessary or appropriate in order to acquaint the Department fully with the particular circumstances of its case; however, the statements contained in an application shall be restricted to significant and relevant facts.

              (b) An applicant for new or amended certificate or commuter air carrier authority may not advertise or publish schedule listings for the air transportation covered by its application after the application has been approved by the Department (but before all authority issued by DOT, including the FAA, becomes effective) unless such advertising or schedule listings prominently state: “This service is subject to receipt of government operating authority.”

              § 201.7
              General certificate conditions.
              (a) It shall be a condition upon the holding of a certificate that any intentional failure by the holder to comply with any provision of Statute or any order, rule, or regulation issued thereunder or any term, condition, or limitation of such certificate shall be a failure to comply with the terms, conditions, and limitations of the certificate within the meaning of section 41110 of the Statute even though the failure to comply occurred outside the territorial limits of the United States, except to the extent that such failure shall be necessitated by an obligation, duty, or liability imposed by a foreign country.
              (b) Failure to file the reports required by part 241, 291, or 298 of this chapter shall be sufficient grounds to revoke a certificate.
              (c) The authority to transport U.S. mail under a certificate is permissive, unless the Department, by order or rule, directs a carrier or class of carriers to transport mail on demand of the U.S. Postal Service; such certificate confers no right to receive subsidy, for the carriage of mail or otherwise.
              (d) An all-cargo air transportation certificate shall confer no right to carry passengers, other than cargo attendants accompanying a shipment, or to engage in any air transportation outside the geographical scope of interstate cargo transportation. Such certificate shall not, however, restrict the right of the holder to provide scheduled, charter, contract, or other transportation of cargo, by air, within that geographical scope.
              (e) It shall be a condition upon the holding of a certificate that the holder have and maintain in effect and on file with the Department a signed counterpart of Agreement 18900 (OST Form 4523), and a tariff (for those carriers otherwise generally required to file tariffs) that includes its terms, and that the holder comply with all other requirements of part 203.

            This part requires that certain U.S. and foreign direct air carriers waive the passenger liability limits and certain carrier defenses in the Warsaw Convention in accordance with the provisions of Agreement 18900, dated May 13, 1966, and provides that acceptance of authority for, or operations by the carrier in, air transportation shall be considered to act as such a waiver by that carrier.

            Filing requirements for adherence to Montreal Agreement.
            All direct U.S. and foreign air carriers shall have and maintain in effect and on file in the Department's Documentary Services Division (Docket 17325) on OST Form 4523 a signed counterpart to Agreement 18900, an agreement relating to liability limitations of the Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol approved by CAB Order E-23680, dated May 13, 1966 (the Montreal Agreement), and a signed counterpart of any amendment or amendments to such Agreement that may be approved by the Department and to which the air carrier or foreign air carrier becomes a party. U.S. air taxi operators registering under part 298 of this chapter and Canadian charter air taxi operators registering under part 294 of this chapter may comply with this requirement by filing completed OST Forms 4507 and 4523, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of those parts.

            (a) As required by the Montreal Agreement, carriers that are otherwise generally required to file tariffs shall file with the Department's Tariffs Division a tariff that includes the provisions of the counterpart to Agreement 18900.
            (b) As further required by that Agreement, each participating carrier shall include the Agreement's terms as part of its conditions of carriage. The participating carrier shall give each of its passengers the notice required by the Montreal Agreement as provided in § 221.175 of this chapter.
            (c) Participation in the Montreal Agreement, whether by signing the Agreement, filing a signed counterpart to it under § 203.3, or by operation of law under § 203.5, shall constitute a special agreement between the carrier and its passengers as a condition of carriage that a liability limit of not less than $75,000 (U.S.) shall apply under Article 22(1) of the Warsaw Convention for passenger injury and death. Such participation also constitutes a waiver of the defense under Article 20(1) of the Convention that the carrier was not negligent.

Notwithstanding any failure to file that counterpart and such tariff, any such air carrier or foreign air carrier issued license authority (including exemptions) by the Department or operating in air transportation shall be deemed to have agreed to the provisions of Agreement 18900 as fully as if that air carrier or foreign air carrier had in fact filed a properly executed counterpart to that Agreement and tariff.

              § 204.4
              Carriers proposing to provide essential air service.
              Applicants proposing to provide essential air service have been divided into two categories, and are subject to differing data submission requirements as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. However, if a carrier has previously filed any of the required data with the Department or other Federal agency and they are available to the Department, and these data continue to reflect the current state of the carrier's fitness, the carrier may instead identify the data and provide a citation for the date and place of filing. All carriers may contact the Air Carrier Fitness Division to ascertain what information is already available to the Department and thus may not need to be resubmitted.
              (a) Carriers who propose to begin or expand non-subsidized essential air service when the incumbent leaves the market must file the following information:
              (1) All of the information required under § 204.3 of this part.

              (5) A list of the markets the carrier serves and the number of weekly round trips it provides in each.
              (6) A description of the average number of block hours each type of aircraft is currently flown per day.
              (7) An estimate of the impact the proposed essential air service would have on the carrier's utilization of its aircraft fleet.
              (8) A detailed schedule of the service to be provided, including times of arrivals and departures, the aircraft to be used for each flight, and the fares to be charged.
              (9) A pro-forma income statement for the proposed operation for the first annual period.
              (b) Carriers filing proposals to provide subsidized service in response to an order inviting proposals shall file:

              § 204.5
              Certificated and commuter air carriers undergoing or proposing to undergo substantial change in operations, ownership, or management.
              (a) A certificated or commuter air carrier proposing a substantial change in operations, ownership or management shall file the data set forth in § 204.3. These data must be submitted in cases where:
              (1) The proposed change requires new or amended authority, or
              (2) The change substantially alters the factors upon which its latest fitness finding is based, even if no new authority is required.
              (b) Information which a carrier has previously formally filed with the Department, or with another Federal agency where they are available to the Department, which continues to reflect the current state of the carrier's fitness may be omitted. The carrier instead should identify the data and provide a citation for the date(s) and place(s) of filing. Prior to filing any data, the carrier may contact the Department (Air Carrier Fitness Division) to ascertain what data required by this section, if any, are already available to the Department or are not applicable to the substantial change in question and need not be included in the filing.

              (c) Information filings pursuant to this section made to support an application for new or amended certificate authority shall be filed with the application and addressed to Docket Operations, M-30, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590, or by electronic submission at http://dms.dot.gov.
              

              (d) Information filed in support of a certificated or commuter air carrier's continuing fitness to operate under its existing authority in light of substantial changes in its operations, management, or ownership, including changes that may affect the air carrier's citizenship, shall be addressed to the Chief, Air Carrier Fitness Division, Office of the Secretary, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590.

              § 204.6
              Certificated and commuter air carriers proposing a change in operations, ownership, or management which is not substantial.
              Carriers proposing to make a change which would not substantially affect their operations, management, or ownership, such as certificated carriers applying for additional authority which would not substantially change their operations, will be presumed to be fit and need not file any information relating to their fitness at time of the change. However, if the Department concludes, from its own analysis or based on information submitted by third parties, that such change may bring the carrier's fitness into question, the Department may require the applicant carrier to file additional information.
            
            
              § 204.7
              Revocation for dormancy.
              (a) An air carrier that has not commenced any type of air transportation operations for which it was found fit, willing, and able within one year of the date of that finding, or an air carrier that, for any period of one year after the date of such a finding, has not provided any type of air transportation for which that kind of finding is required, is deemed no longer to continue to be fit to provide the air transportation for which it was found fit and, accordingly, its authority to provide such air transportation shall be revoked.
              (b) An air carrier found fit which commences operations within one year after being found fit but then ceases operations, shall not resume operations without first filing all of the data required by § 204.3 at least 45 days before it intends to provide any such air transportation. Such filings shall be addressed to the Documentary Services Division, Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. The Department will entertain requests for exemption from this 45-day advance filing requirement for good cause shown. If there has been no change in fitness data previously formally filed with the Department, the carrier shall file a sworn statement to that effect signed by one of its officers. The carrier may contact the Department (Air Carrier Fitness Division) to ascertain which data are already available to the Department and need not be refiled. A carrier to which this paragraph applies shall not provide any air transportation for which it is required to be found fit, willing, and able until the Department decides that the carrier continues to be fit, willing, and able to perform such air transportation. During the pendency of the Department's consideration of a data submission under this paragraph, the expiration period set out in paragraph (a) of this section shall be stayed. If the decision or finding by the Department on the issue of the carrier's fitness is favorable, the date or that decision or finding shall be the date considered in applying paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) For purposes of this section, the date of a Department decision or finding shall be the service date of the Department's order containing such decision or finding, or, in cases where the Department's decision or finding is made by letter, the date of such letter.
              (d) For purposes of this section, references to operations and to the providing of air transportation shall refer only to the actual performance of flight operations under an operating certificate issued to the carrier by the FAA.

            § 205.1
            Purpose.
            This part contains the rules for aircraft accident liability insurance coverage needed by U.S. direct air carriers to obtain or to exercise authority from the Department to operate in interstate or foreign air transportation, and by foreign direct air carriers to operate under permit or other authority in foreign air transportation. It further requires a disclosure statement to shippers about cargo liability limits and insurance coverage for U.S. and foreign direct air carriers.

            § 205.2
            Applicability.
            These rules apply to all U.S. direct air carriers, including commuter air carriers and air taxi operators as defined in § 298.2 of this chapter, and foreign direct air carriers, including Canadian charter air taxi operators as defined in § 294.2(c) of this chapter.

            § 205.3
            Basic requirements.
            (a) A U.S. or foreign direct air carrier shall not engage in air transportation unless it has in effect aircraft accident liability insurance coverage that meets the requirements of this part for its air carrier or foreign air carrier operations. The minimum amounts of coverage required by this part may be provided either by insurance policies or by self-insurance plans. The currently effective policy of insurance or complete plan for self-insurance shall be available for inspection by the Department at the carrier's principal place of business. The current certificate of insurance or a summary of the complete self-insurance plan on file with the Department, as required by § 205.4, shall be available for public inspection at the carrier's principal place of business.
            (b) For purposes of this part, a certificate of insurance is one or more certificates showing insurance by one or more insurers (excluding reinsurers) of currently effective and properly endorsed policies of aircraft accident liability insurance in compliance with this part. When more than one such insurer is providing coverage, the limits and types of liability assumed by each insurer (excluding reinsurers) shall be clearly stated in the certificate of insurance. Insurance policies and self-insurance plans named in a certificate of insurance that accompanies an application for initial registration or for operating authority shall become effective not later than the proposed starting date for air carrier operations as shown in the application.
            (c) The certificate of insurance shall list the types or classes of aircraft, or the specific aircraft by FAA or foreign government registration number, with respect to which the policy of insurance applies, or shall state that the policy applies to all aircraft owned or operated by the carrier in its air transportation operations. With respect to certificates of insurance that list aircraft by government registration number, the policy or self-insurance plan shall state that, while an aircraft owned or leased by the carrier and declared in the policy is withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, or servicing, such insurance as is provided by the policy or plan for that aircraft shall apply also to another aircraft of similar type, horsepower, and seating capacity, whether or not owned by the insured, while temporarily used as a substitute aircraft.
            (d) Each certificate of insurance shall be signed by an authorized officer, agent, or other representative of the insurer or the insurance broker.
            (e) Insurance coverage to meet the requirements of this part shall be obtained from one or more of the following:
            (1) An insurer licensed to issue aircraft accident liability policies in any State, Commonwealth, or Territory of the United States, or in the District of Columbia;

            (2) Surplus line insurers named on a current list of such insurers issued and approved by the insurance regulatory authority of any State, Commonwealth, or Territory of the United States or of the District of Columbia; or
            

            (3) Insurers licensed or approved by a foreign government.
            
            This requirement may be waived by the Department in the public interest.

            § 205.4
            Filing of evidence of insurance.

            (a) A U.S. or foreign air carrier shall file a certificate of insurance or a complete plan for self-insurance with the Department. Each carrier shall ensure that the evidence of aircraft accident liability coverage filed with the Department is correct at all times. The Department will normally notify the carrier within 20 days of receipt if the certificate or plan does not meet the requirements of this part. Certificates of Insurance shall be filed on OST Form 6410 for U.S. air carriers, including commuter air carriers and air taxi operators, and OST Form 6411 for foreign air carriers, including Canadian air taxi operators. The Department may return the certificate or self-insurance plan to the carrier if it finds for good cause that such certificate or plan does not show adequate evidence of insurance coverage under this part. Forms may be obtained from and should be filed with the Department at the addresses specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Forms may also be obtained on the Internet at http://ostpxweb.dot.gov.
            
            (b) If the coverage is by type or class of aircraft or by specific aircraft, endorsements that add previously unlisted aircraft or aircraft types or classes to coverage, or that delete listed aircraft, types, or classes from coverage, shall be filed with the Department at the addresses specified in paragraph (c) of this section not more than 30 days after the effective date of the endorsements. Aircraft shall not be listed in the carrier's operations specifications with the FAA and shall not be operated unless liability insurance coverage is in force.
            (c) Certificates of insurance and endorsements required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be submitted to the Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Program Management Branch, AFS-260, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591. For those air carriers that have a mailing address in the State of Alaska, the forms shall be submitted to the Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Alaskan Region Headquarters, AAL-230, 222 West 7th Avenue, Box 14, Anchorage, Alaska 99513. For Canadian air taxis, the forms shall be submitted to the Department of Transportation, Special Authorities Division, X-46, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590.

            § 205.5
            Minimum coverage.
            (a) Insurance contracts and self-insurance plans shall provide for payment on behalf of the carrier, within the specific limits of liability in this section, of all sums that the carrier shall become legally obligated to pay as damages, excluding any deductible in the policy, for bodily injury to or death of a person, or for damage to the property of others, resulting from the carrier's operation or maintenance of aircraft in air transportation provided under its authority from the Department.
            (b) U.S. and foreign direct air carriers, including commuter air carriers but excluding U.S. air taxi operators and Canadian charter air taxi operators, shall maintain the following coverage:
            (1) Third-party aircraft accident liability coverage for bodily injury to or death of persons, including nonemployee cargo attendants, other than passengers, and for damage to property, with minimum limits of $300,000 for any one person in any one occurrence, and a total of $20,000,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence, except that for aircraft of not more than 60 seats or 18,000 pounds maximum payload capacity, carriers need only maintain coverage of $2,000,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence.

            (2) Any such carrier providing air transportation for passengers shall, in addition to the coverage required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, maintain aircraft accident liability insurance coverage for bodily injury to or death of aircraft passengers, with minimum limits of $300,000 for any one passenger, and a total per involved aircraft for each occurrence of $300,000 times 75 percent of the number of passenger seats installed in the aircraft.
            (c) U.S. air taxi operators registered under part 298 shall maintain the following coverage:
            (1) Third-party aircraft accident liability coverage for bodily injury to or death of persons, including nonemployee cargo attendants, other than passengers, with minimum limits of:
            (i) $75,000 for any one person in any one occurrence, and a total of $300,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence, and
            (ii) A limit of a least $100,000 for each occurrence for loss of or damage to property.
            (2) U.S. air taxi operators carrying passengers in air transportation shall, in addition to the coverage required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, maintain aircraft accident liability insurance coverage for bodily injury to or death of aircraft passengers, with minimum limits of $75,000 for any one passenger, and a total per involved aircraft for each occurrence of $75,000 times 75 percent of the number of passenger seats installed in the aircraft.
            (d) Canadian charter air taxi operators registered under part 294 of this chapter shall maintain the following coverage:
            (1) Third-party aircraft accident liability coverage for bodily injury to or death of persons, including nonemployee cargo attendants, other than passengers, and for damage to property, with a minimum coverage of $75,000 for any one person in any one occurrence, and a total of $2,000,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence, except that Canadian charter air taxi operators operating aircraft of more than 30 seats or 7,500 pounds maximum cargo payload capacity, and a maximum authorized takeoff weight on wheels not greater than 35,000 pounds shall maintain coverage for those aircraft of $20,000,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence.
            (2) Canadian charter air taxi operators engaging in passenger charter air service under part 294 of this chapter shall, in addition to the coverage required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, maintain aircraft accident liability coverage for bodily injury to or death of aircraft passengers, with a minimum coverage of $75,000 for any one passenger and a total per involved aircraft for each occurrence of $75,000 times 75 percent of the total number of passenger seats installed in the aircraft.
            (e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the carrier may be insured for a combined single limit of liability for each occurrence. The combined single-limit coverage must be not less than the combined required minimums for bodily injury and property damage coverage plus, if the aircraft is used in passenger service, the required total passenger coverages stipulated in paragraph (b) of this section for U.S. and foreign direct air carriers and commuter carriers, paragraph (c) of this section for U.S. air taxi operators, or paragraph (d) of this section for Canadian charter air taxi operators. 1
               The single-limit liability policy for the required aircraft accident liability coverage may be provided by a single policy or by a combination of primary and excess policies.
            
              
                1 For example: the minimum single limit of liability acceptable for any aircraft in air taxi passenger service with 16 passenger seats would be computed on the basis of limits set forth in paragraph (c) as follows: 16 × .75 equals 12; 12 × $75,000 equals $900,000; $900,000 plus $300,000 (nonpassenger liability per occurrence) plus $100,000 (property damage per occurrence) equals $1,300,000. The latter amount is the minimum in which a single-limit liability policy may be written.
            
            (f) The liability coverage shall not be contingent upon the financial condition, solvency, or freedom from bankruptcy of the carrier. The limits of the liability for the amounts required by this part shall apply separately to each occurrence. Any payment made under the policy or plan because of any one occurrence shall not reduce the coverage for payment of other damages resulting from any other occurrence.

            § 205.6
            Prohibited exclusions of coverage.
            (a) No warranty or exclusion in the policy or plan or in any endorsement or amendment to the policy or plan, nor any violation of the policy or plan by the carrier, shall remove the liability coverage required by this part, except as specifically approved by the Department. This requirement shall not limit the right of insurers to recover from the carrier for amounts paid.
            (b) A policy of insurance or a self-insurance plan required by this part shall not contain the following exclusions:
            (1) Violation of any safety-related requirement imposed by statute or by rule of a government agency.
            (2) Liability assumed by the carrier under an agreement to raise the liability limitations of the Warsaw Convention by signing a counterpart to the agreement of carriers (such as the Montreal Agreement, 18900, as approved by Board Order E-23680, May 13, 1966, agreeing to a limit on the carrier's liability for injury or death of passengers of $75,000 per passenger), or any amendment to such agreement that may be approved by the Department and to which the carrier becomes a party.

            § 205.7
            Cancellation, withdrawal, modification, expiration, or replacement of insurance coverage.
            (a) Each policy of aircraft accident liability insurance and plan for self insurance shall specify that it shall remain in force, and may not be replaced, canceled, withdrawn, or in any way modified to reduce the minimum standards set forth in this part, or to change the extent of coverage, by the insurer or the carrier, nor expire by its own terms, in regard to coverage for the carrier in its common carrier operations in air transportation, until 10 days after written notice by the insurer (in the event of replacement, by the retiring insurer), or by the insurer's representative, or by the carrier, describing the change, to the Department at the addresses specified in § 205.4(c), which 10-day notice period shall start to run from the date such notice is actually received at the Department. For purposes of this part, a policy will not be considered to have expired if the same insurer renews its coverage without reduction in the extent of coverage or amounts of coverage, and without a break in coverage, whether or not a new policy is issued, and notice to the Department is not required in that event. If the coverage being changed is by type or class of aircraft or by specific aircraft, endorsements adding or deleting specific aircraft or types or classes of aircraft, for which prior notice would be required by this paragraph, shall be filed in accordance with § 205.4(b), and prior notice of the change need not be given under this paragraph.
            (b) The requirements of this section shall not apply if the policy contains a lesser time period for cancellation in a war risk exclusion. If the war risk exclusion is activated by the insurer, the insurer or its representative shall immediately notify the Department.

The notice shall be clearly and conspicuously included on or attached to all of its rate sheets and airwaybills.

            (b) If a certificated carrier, when conducting operations with small aircraft, provides foreign air transportation that includes a segment for which tariff filing is required and another segment for which tariff filing is not required, then for through service over that routing the carrier has the option of filing a tariff or charging the sum of the applicable local rates, fares, or charges. If the carrier files a tariff for through service, it is not exempt from Chapter 415 or section 41310 of the Statute for that air transportation.

              (a) That the carrier is organized under the laws of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau or the United States;
              (b) That substantial ownership and effective control of the carrier are held by citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau and/or the United States;
              (c) That citizens of other countries do not have interests in the carrier sufficient to permit them substantially to influence its actions, or that substantial justification exists for a temporary waiver of this requirement;
              (d) That the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration has determined that the carrier complies with such safety standards as the Administrator considers to be required.
              (e) That the government or governments of the Freely Associated States concerned have consented to the carrier's operation as a “Freely Associated State Air Carrier.”
            
            
              § 211.32
              Issuance of permit.

              If the Department is satisfied that the applicant meets the requirements of § 211.31 (a) through (e), and that grant of all or part of the requested authority would otherwise be in the public interest, the Department may, subject to Presidential review under section 801(a) of the Federal Aviation Act, issue a “Freely Associated State Foreign Air Carrier Permit” to the applicant, including such terms, conditions or limitations as the Department may find to be in the public interest.
              
            
            
              § 211.33
              Interstate and interstate authority.
              (a) An application under this subpart may include a request, in addition to other foreign air transportation, for authority to engage in interstate air transportation between Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Honolulu, Hawaii, and interstate air transportation within the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. A request for all or part of such limited interstate air transportation authority shall be supported by documentation establishing:
              (1) The impact of such interstate air transportation services on the economic projections of the carrier's proposed operations;
              (2) The need for such proposed interstate air transportation by the affected U.S. points;
              (3) The economic impact of such interstate air transportation on services provided by other carriers providing essential air transportation services to eligible Freely Associated State points within the scope of part 272 of this chapter.
              (b) The Department may grant a Freely Associated State Air Carrier authority to engage in all or part of the interstate air transportation requested in paragraph (a) of this section provided that the Department finds:
              (1) That grant of such interstate air transportation authority would be in furtherance of the objectives of the Compact of Free Association and related agreements between the United States and the Freely Associated States, and would otherwise be in the public interest; and

              (2) That grant of such interstate air transportation authority would not significantly impair the economic viability of existing services providing essential air transportation to any eligible Freely Associated State point within the scope of part 272 of this chapter, or significantly increase compensation that may be required to maintain any such essential air transportation.
              (c) The Department may, at any time, subject to Presidential review under section 41307, suspend, modify, or revoke such interstate authority if it concludes that the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section are not then being met.

              § 211.34
              Other permits.
              Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Department to issue a foreign air carrier permit, other than a Freely Associated State Foreign Air Carrier Permit, to a carrier owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands or Palau, that does not meet the requirements of this section.

              Termination of eligibility.
              The eligibility of a carrier owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands or Palau, respectively, for issuance of a Freely Associated State Foreign Air Carrier Permit under this subpart shall exist only for such period as subparagraphs (a), (d), and (e) (eligibility for Freely Associated State essential air transportation subsidy compensation), or subparagraph (c) (limited interstate air transportation authority), of paragraph (5) of the Agreement on Civil Aviation Economic Services and Related Programs (Article IX of the Federal Programs and Services Agreement) remain in effect between the Government of those States and the Government of the United States, insofar as authority is conferred by such permits for purposes specified in those subparagraphs.

            § 212.3
            General provisions.
            (a) Certificated and foreign air carriers may conduct charter flights as described in this part, and may carry charter passengers on scheduled flights, or charter cargo on scheduled or nonscheduled flights (or on the main deck or in the belly of passenger charter flights), subject to the requirements of this chapter and any orders of, or specific conditions imposed by, the Department.
            (b) Charter flights may be operated on a round-trip or one-way basis, with no minimum group, shipment, or contract size.

            (c) Contracts to perform charter flights must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the certificated or foreign air carrier and the charterer prior to the operation of the flights involved. The written agreement shall include:
            (i) The name and address of either the surety whose bond secures advance charter payments received by the carrier, or of the carrier's depository bank to which checks or money orders for the advance charter payments are to be made payable as escrow holder pending completion of the charter trip; and
            (2) A statement that unless the charterer files a claim with the carrier, or, if the carrier is unavailable, with the surety, within 60 days after the cancellation of a charter trip with respect to which the charterer's advance payments are secured by the bond, the surety shall be released from all liability under the bond to such charterer for such trips.
            (d) A certificated or foreign air carrier must make a reasonable effort to verify that any charterer with which it contracts, and any charter it conducts, meets the applicable requirements of this chapter.

            (e) The certificated or foreign air carriers shall require full payment of the total charter price, including payment for the return portion of a round trip, or the posting of a satisfactory bond for full payment, prior to the commencement of any portion of the air transportation, provided, however, that in the case of a passenger charter for less than the entire of an aircraft, the carrier shall require full payment of the total charter price, including payment for the return portion of a round trip, from the charterers not less than 10 days prior to the commencement of any portion of the transportation, and such payment shall not be refundable unless the charter is canceled by the carrier or unless the carrier accepts a substitute charterer for one which has canceled a charter, in which case the amount paid by the latter shall be refunded. For the purpose of this section, payment to the carrier's depository bank, as designated in the charter contract, shall be deemed payment to the carrier.
            (f) A certificated or foreign air carrier operating a U.S.-originating passenger charter shall be responsible to return to his or her point of origin any passenger who purchased round trip transportation on that charter and who was transported by that carrier on his or her outbound flight; except that this provision shall not apply in cases where the return transportation is to be provided by another certificated or foreign air carrier.
            (g) A certificated or foreign air carrier may not perform any charter flight for which a statement of authorization is required under § 212.9 until one has been granted by the Department. In addition, if a foreign air carrier is required to obtain a statement of authorization under paragraph (e) of that section, neither it, not any charter operator, or any other person shall advertise or sell any passenger charter services except those that have been specifically authorized by the Department.
            (h) A certificated air carrier may not operate charters where such operations would result in a substantial change in the scope of its operations within the meaning of part 204 of this chapter.
            (i) A certificated air carrier may not limit its baggage liability for interstate charter flights except as set forth in part 254 of this chapter.
            (j) A certificated air carrier may not, except as set forth in part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 121), limit the availability, upon reasonable request, of air transportation and related services to a person who may require help from another person in expeditiously moving to an emergency exit for evacuation of an aircraft.
            (k) A certificated air carrier holding a certificate to conduct only cargo operations may not conduct passenger charters.
            (l) A certificated air carrier may not perform any charter in interstate commerce within the State of Alaska.
            (m) A foreign air carrier may operate charters in foreign air transportation only to the extent authorized by its foreign air carrier permit under 49 U.S.C. 41302 or exemption authority under 49 U.S.C. 40109, and only to the extent to which such operations are consistent with the provisions of any applicable bilateral aviation undertaking.

            (b) Single entity charters, including:

            (2) Charters pursuant to contracts with the Department of Defense, provided, that foreign air carriers may conduct charters for the Department of Defense only to the extent that such operations are consistent with the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 40118.
            (c) Mixed charters.
            (d) Gambling junket charters.

            (c) No solicitation, sales, or participation may take place beyond the bona fide members of an eligible chartering organization, and their immediate families (spouse, children, and parents). All printed solicitation materials shall contain the following notice in boldface, 10-point or larger type—
            Some of the Federal rules that protect against tour changes and loss of passengers' money in publicly sold charters do not apply to this charter flight.

            (d) “Bona fide members” are members of an organization who: Have not joined the organization merely to travel on a charter flight; and who have been members of the chartering organization for a minimum of six months prior to the date of commencement of the affected flight; provided, that the “six month” rule does not apply to:
            (1) Employees of a single commercial establishment, industrial plant, or government agency, or
            (2) Students and employees of a single school.
            (e) The charter price due the direct air carrier shall be prorated equally among all the charter passengers, except that children under 12 may be offered discounted or free transportation.
            (f) The certificated or foreign air carrier shall make reasonable efforts to assure that passengers transported meet the eligibility requirements of this section. The certificated or foreign air carrier shall also obtain (no later than the date of departure), and maintain for two years, a certification by an authorized representative of the chartering organization that all passengers are eligible for transportation under this section.
          
          
            § 212.6

            (2) An agent of such a casino, or cruise line on behalf of that casino, hotel, or cruise line.

            (b) The casino, hotel, or cruise line or its agents, may not require a passenger to incur any expense in taking the trip, provided, that this provision shall not preclude the casino, hotel, or cruise line or its agents, from requiring prospective passengers to pay nominal reservation fees that are duly refundable by the casino, hotel, or cruise line before the flight, establish a minimum line-of-credit at the casino, hotel, or cruise line, bring (but not necessarily spend) a specified minimum amount of money, or meet other requirements that do not place them in financial jeopardy; nor does it preclude the casino, hotel, or cruise line, or its agents, from offering operational land packages for a fee.
          
          
            § 212.7

            (b) Each certificated or foreign air carrier operating a charter trip under this section shall comply with all the requirements of part 380 of this chapter, except that:
            (1) Those provisions of part 380 relating to the existence of a contract between a charter operator and a direct air carrier do not apply;
            (2) A depository agreement shall comply with § 380.34a (d) and (f);
            (3) A security agreement shall comply with § 380.34 (c) and (d); and
            (i) If no depository agreement is used, protect charter participant payments (including those for ground accommodations and services) and assure the certificated or foreign air carrier's contractual and regulatory responsibilities to charter participants in an unlimited amount (except that the liability of the securer with respect to any charter participant may be limited to the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant);
            (ii) If used in combination with a depository agreement, protect charter participant payments (including those for ground accommodations and services) and assure the certificated or foreign air carrier's contractual and regulatory responsibilities to charter participants in the amount of at least $10,000 times the number of flights, except that the amount need not be more than $200,000. The liability of the securer with respect to any charter participant may be limited to the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant.
            (c) The Department reserves the right to limit or prohibit the operation of direct sales Public Charters by a foreign air carrier upon a finding that such action is necessary in the public interest.
          
          
            § 212.8
            Protection of customers' payments.
            (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no certificated air carrier or foreign air carrier shall perform any charter trip (other than a cargo charter trip) originating in the United States or any Overseas Military Personnel Charter trip, as defined in part 372 of this chapter, nor shall such carrier accept any advance payment in connection with any such charter trip, unless there is on file with the Department a copy of a currently effective agreement made between said carrier and a designated bank, by the terms of which all sums payable in advance to the carrier by charterers, in connection with any such trip to be performed by said carrier, shall be deposited with and maintained by the bank, as escrow holder, the agreement to be subject to the following conditions:
            (1) The charterer (or its agent) shall pay the carrier either by check or money order made payable to the depository bank. Such check or money order and any cash received by the carrier from a charterer (or its agent) shall be deposited in, or mailed to, the bank no later than the close of the business day following the receipt of the check or money order or the cash, along with a statement showing the name and address of the charterer (or its agent); provided, however, that where the charter transportation to be performed by a carrier is sold through a travel agent, the agent may be authorized by the carrier to deduct its commission and remit the balance of the advance payment to the carrier either by check or money order made payable to the designated bank.

            (2) The bank shall pay over to the carrier escrowed funds with respect to a specific charter only after the carrier has certified in writing to the bank that such charter has been completed; provided, however, that the bank may be required by the terms of the agreement to pay over to the carrier a specified portion of such escrowed funds, as payment for the performance of the outbound segment of a round-trip charter upon the carrier's written certification that such segment has been so completed.
            (3) Refunds to a charterer from sums in the escrow account shall be paid directly to such charterer its assigns. Upon written certification from the carrier that a charter has been canceled, the bank shall turn over directly to the charterer or its assigns all escrowed sums (less any cancellation penalties as provided in the charter contract) which the bank holds with respect to such canceled charter, provided however, that in the case of a split charter escrowed funds shall be turned over to a charterer or its assigns only if the carrier's written certification of cancellation of such charter includes a specific representation that either the charter has been canceled by the carrier or, if the charter has been canceled by the charterer, that the carrier has accepted a substitute charterer.
            (4) The bank shall maintain a separate accounting for each charter flight.
            (5) As used in this section the term “bank” means a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
            (b) The escrow agreement required under paragraph (a) of this section shall not be effective until approved by the Department. Claims against the escrow may be made only with respect to the non-performance of air transportation.
            (c) The carrier may elect, in lieu of furnishing an escrow agreement pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, to furnish and file with the Department a surety bond with guarantees to the United States Government the performance of all charter trips (other than cargo charter trips) originating in the United States and of all overseas military personnel charter trips, as defined in part 372 of this chapter, to be performed, in whole or in part, by such carrier pursuant to any contracts entered into by such carrier. The amount of such bond shall be unlimited. 1
               Claims under the bond may be made only with respect to the non-performance of air transportation.
            
              
                1 While the face amount of the bond is unlimited, claims are limited to amounts that are paid to carrier for U.S.-originating passenger charter flights that carrier fails to perform or to refund.
            
            (d) The bond permitted by this section shall be in the form set forth as the appendix to this part. Such bond shall be issued by a bonding or surety company—
            (1) Which is listed in Best's Insurance Reports (Fire and Casualty) with a general policyholders' rating of “A” or better or

            (2) Which is listed in the U.S. Department of Treasury's notice listing companies holding Certificates of Authority as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds and as acceptable reinsuring companies, published in the Federal Register on or about July 1. The bonding or surety company shall be one legally authorized to issue bonds of that type in the State in which there is located the office or usual residence of the agency designated by the carrier under 49 U.S.C. 46103 to receive service of notices, process and other documents issued by or filed with the Department of Transportation. For the purposes of this section the term “State” includes any territory or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia. If the bond does not comply with the requirements of this section, or for any reason fails to provide satisfactory or adequate protection for the public, the Department will notify the certificated or foreign air carrier by registered or certified mail, stating the deficiencies of the bond. Unless such deficiencies are corrected within the time limit set forth in the notification, no amounts payable in advance by customers for the subject charter trips shall be accepted by the carrier.

            (e) The bond required by this section shall provide that unless the charterer files a claim with the carrier, or, if the carrier is unavailable, with the surety, within 60 days after cancellation of a charter trip with respect to which the charterer's advance payments are secured by the bond, the surety shall be released from all liability under the bond to such charterer for such charter trip. The contract between the carrier and the charterer shall contain notice of this provision.
          
          
            § 212.9
            Prior authorization requirements.
            (a) Certificated air carriers shall obtain a statement of authorization for each long-term wet lease to a foreign air carrier.
            (b) Foreign air carriers shall obtain a statement of authorization for each:
            (1) Fifth-, sixth- and/or seventh-freedom charter flights to or from the United States;
            (2) Long-term wet lease;
            (3) Charter flight for which the Department specifically requires prior authorization under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section; or
            (4) Part charter.
            (c) The Department may issue blanket statements of authorization to foreign air carriers to conduct fifth freedom charters. The standards for issuing such blanket authorizations shall be those stated in § 212.11. The Department may revoke any authority granted under this paragraph at any time without hearing.
            (d) The Department may at any time, with or without hearing, but with at least 30 days' notice, require a foreign air carrier to obtain a statement of authorization before operating any charter flight. In deciding whether to impose such a requirement, the Department will consider (but not be limited to considering) whether the country of the carrier's nationality:
            (1) Requires prior approval for third or fourth freedom charter flights by U.S. air carriers;
            (2) Has, over the objection of the U.S. Government, denied rights of a U.S. air carrier guaranteed by a bilateral agreement; or
            (3) Has otherwise impaired, limited, or denied the operating rights of U.S. air carriers, or engaged in unfair, discriminatory, or restrictive practices with respect to air transportation services to, from, through, or over its territory.
            (e) The Department, in the interest of national security, may require a foreign air carrier to provide prior notification or to obtain a statement of authorization before operating any charter flight over U.S. territory.

            § 212.10
            Application for statement of authorization.
            (a) Application for a statement of authorization shall be submitted on OST Form 4540 except that for part charters or long-term wet leases the application may be in letter form. An application for a long-term wet lease shall describe the purpose and terms of the wet lease agreement. Except for an application for a long-term wet lease involving a codeshare agreement, an original and two copies of an application shall be submitted to the Department of Transportation, Office of International Aviation, U.S. Air Carrier Licensing Division, X-44 (for an application by a certificated air carrier), or Foreign Air Carrier Licensing Division, X-45 (for an application by a foreign air carrier), 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590; an original and two copies of an application for a long-term wet lease involving a codeshare agreement shall be submitted to DOT Dockets, PL-401, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590, or by electronic submission to DOT Dockets according to procedures at the DOT Dockets website. Upon a showing of good cause, the application may be transmitted by facsimile (fax) or telegram, or may be made by telephone, provided, that in the case of a fax or telephone application, the applicant must confirm its request (by filing an original and two copies of its application as described above) within three business days.
            (b) A copy of each application for a long-term wet lease shall also be served on the Director of Flight Standards Service (AFS-1), Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, and on each certificated air carrier that is authorized to serve the general area in which the proposed transportation is to be performed.

            (c)(1) Applicants for statements of authorization filed by foreign air carriers shall include documentation to establish the extent to which the country of the applicant's nationality deals with U.S. air carriers on the basis of reciprocity for similar flights, if such flights are not subject to a bilateral agreement, and
            (i) The Department has not established that the country accords reciprocity;
            (ii) The Department has found reciprocity defective in the most recent prior approval application involving the country; or
            (iii) Changes in reciprocity have occurred since the most recent Department finding for the country in question.
            (2) Applications filed by certificated or foreign air carriers to conduct long-term wet leases shall include, for the country of the lessee's nationality, the documentation specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
            (d)(1) Applications shall be filed at least 5 business days before commencement of the proposed flight or flights, except as specified in paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) of this section. Late applications may be considered upon a showing of good cause for the lateness.
            (2) Applications for a part charter or for a long-term wet lease shall be filed at least 45 calendar days before the date of the first proposed flight.
            (3) Applications specifically required under § 212.9(d) shall be filed at least 30 calendar days before the proposed flight or flights (10 calendar days for cargo charters), unless otherwise specified by the Department.
            (4) Applications required by a Department order under § 212.9(e) shall be filed at least 14 calendar days before the proposed flight or flights, unless otherwise specified by the Department.
            (5) Where an application is required by more than one provision of this part and/or order of the Department, only one application need be filed, but it must conform to the earliest applicable filing deadline.
            (6) The Department may require service of applications as it deems necessary.
            (e)(1) Any part in interest may file a memorandum supporting or opposing an application. Three copies of each memorandum shall be filed within 7 business days after service of the application or before the date of the proposed flight or flights, whichever is earlier. Memorandums will be considered to the extent practicable; the Department may act on an application without waiting for supporting or opposing memorandums to be filed.
            (2) Each memorandum shall set forth the reasons why the application should be granted or denied, accompanied by whatever data, including affidavits, the Department is requested to consider.
            (3) A copy of each memorandum shall be served on the certified or foreign air carrier applying for approval.
            (f)(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the Department, each application and memorandum filed in response will be available for public inspection at the Office of International Aviation immediately upon filing. Such information with respect to codeshare applications and responsive pleadings will be available for public inspection at DOT Dockets or at the DOT Dockets website. Notice of the filing of all applications shall be published in the Department's Weekly List of Applications Filed.
            (2) Any person objecting to public disclosure of any information in an application or memorandum must state the grounds for the objection in writing. If the Department finds that disclosure of all or part of the information would adversely affect the objecting person, and that the public interest does not require disclosure, it will order that the injurious information be withheld.

            § 212.11
            Issuance of statement of authorization.
            (a) The Department will issue a statement of authorization if it finds that the proposed charter flight, part charter, or wet lease meets the requirements of this part and that it is in the public interest. Statements of authorization may be conditioned or limited.
            (b) In determining the public interest the Department will consider (but not be limited to) the following factors:

            (1) The extent to which the authority sought to covered by and consistent with bilateral agreements to which the United States is a party.
            
            (2) The extent to which an applicant foreign air carrier's home country (and, in the case of a long-term wet lease, the lessee's home country) deals with U.S. air carriers on the basis of substantial reciprocity.
            (3) Whether the applicant or its agent has previously violated the provisions of this part.
            (4) Where the application concerns a long-term wet lease:
            (i) Whether the lessor (applicant) or its agent or the lessee (charterer) or its agent has previously violated the provisions of the Department's charter regulations.
            (ii) Whether, because of the nature of the arrangement and the benefits involved, the authority sought should be the subject of a bilateral agreement.
            (iii) To what extent the lessor owns and/or controls the lessee, or is owned and/or controlled by the lessee.
            (c) The Department will submit any denial of an authorization specifically required of a foreign air carrier under § 212.9(d) to the President of the United States at least 10 days before the proposed departure. The denial will be subject to stay or disapproval by the President within 10 days after it is submitted. A shorter period for Presidential review may be specified by the Department where the application for authorization is not timely or properly filed. Denial of a late-filed application need not be submitted to the President. For the purposes of this paragraph, an application filed by a foreign air carrier under § 212.9(d) to conduct a cargo charter will be considered as timely filed only if it is filed at least 30 calendar days before the proposed flight, notwithstanding the 10-day filing requirement for cargo charters in § 212.10(d)(3).
            (d) The Department will publish notice of its actions on applications for statements of authorization in its Weekly List of Applications Filed. Interested persons may upon request obtain copies of letters of endorsed forms advising applicants of action taken on their applications.
          
          
            § 212.12
            Waiver.
            The Department may grant a waiver of any of the provisions of this part upon a finding that such waiver is in the public interest. A certificated or foreign air carrier may request a waiver by filing a written application with the Department, citing the specific provision to be waived and providing justification for such waiver.
          
          
            Pt. 212, App. A
            Appendix A to Part 212—Certificated or Foreign Air Carrier's Surety Bond Under Part 212 of the Regulations of the Department of Transportation (14 CFR Part 212)
            Know all persons by these presents, that we __________ (Name of certificated or foreign air carrier) of __________, (City) __________ (State or Country) as Principal (hereinafter called Principal), and __________ (name of Surety) a corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of ________ (State) as Surety (hereinafter called Surety) are held and firmly bound unto the United States of America in an unlimited amount, as required by 14 CFR 212.8, for which payment, well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.
            Whereas the principal, a certificated air carrier holding a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued under 49 U.S.C. 41102, or a foreign air carrier holding a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. 41302 or an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 40109 authorizing that foreign air carrier to engage in charter trips in foreign air transportation, is subject to rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation relating to security for the protection of charterers of civil aircraft and has elected to file with the Department of Transportation such a bond as will guarantee to the United States Government the performance of all charter trips (other than cargo charter trips) originating in the United States and of all Overseas Military Personnel Charters, as defined in 14 CFR part 372, to be performed, in whole or in part, by such certificated or foreign air carrier pursuant to contracts entered into by such carrier after the execution date of this bond, and
            Whereas this bond is written to assure compliance by the Principal with rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation relating to security for the protection of charterer of civil aircraft for charter trips (other than cargo charters) originating in the United States or of Overseas Military Personnel Charter trips and shall inure to the benefit of any and all such charterers to whom the Principal may be held legally liable for any of the damages herein described.

            Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if the Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to such charterer any sum or sums for which the Principal may be held legally liable by reason of the Principal's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill, and carry out all contracts made by the Principal while this bond is in effect for the performance of charter trips (other than cargo charter trips) originating in the United States and of Overseas Military Personnel Charter trips, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.
            The liability of the Surety shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder in any specified amount. The surety agrees to furnish written notice to the Department of Transportation forthwith of all suits filed, judgments rendered, and payments made by said Surety under this bond.
            This bond is effective the ___ day of ________, ____, 12:01 a.m., standard time at the address of the Principal as stated herein and shall continue in force until terminated as hereinafter provided. The Principal or the Surety may at any time terminate this bond by written notice to the Department of Transportation at its office in Washington, D.C., such termination to become effective thirty (30) days after actual receipt of said notice by the Department. The Surety shall not be liable hereunder for the payment of the damages hereinbefore described which arise as the result of any contracts for the performance of air transportation services made by the Principal after the termination of this bond becomes effective, as herein provided, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the Surety hereunder for the payment of any such damages arising as the result of contracts for the performance of air transportation services made by the Principal after the termination of this bond becomes effective. Liability of the Surety under this bond shall in all events be limited only to a charterer who shall within sixty (60) days after the cancellation of a charter trip with respect to which the charterer's advance payments are secured by this bond give written notice of claim to the certificated or foreign air carrier, or, if it is unavailable, to the Surety, and all liability on this bond for such charter trip shall automatically terminate sixty (60) days after the termination date thereof except for claims filed within the time provided herein.
            In witness whereof, the said Principal and Surety have executed this instrument on the ___ day of ________, ____.

            § 213.3
            Filing and approval of schedules.
            (a) In the absence of provisions to the contrary in the permit and of Department action pursuant to this section, a foreign air carrier may determine the schedules (including type of equipment used) pursuant to which it engages in transportation between points in the United States and points outside thereof.
            (b) In the case of a foreign air carrier permit for scheduled air transportation which is not the subject of an air transport agreement between the United States and the government of the holder, the Department, if it finds that the public interest so requires, may with or without hearing order the foreign air carrier to file with it within 7 days after service of such order, an original and three copies of any or all of its existing schedules of service between any point in the United States and any point outside thereof, and may require such carrier thereafter to file an original and three copies of any proposed schedules of service between such points at least 30 days prior to the date of inauguration of such service. Such schedules shall contain all schedules of aircraft which are or will be operated by such carrier between each pair of points set forth in the order, the type of equipment used or to be used, the time of arrival and departure at each point, the frequency of each schedule, and the effective date of any proposed schedule.
            (c) In the case of any foreign air carrier permit for scheduled air transportation which is the subject of an air transport agreement between the United States and the government of the holder, the Department may with or without hearing issue an order, similar to that provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, if it makes the findings provided for in that subsection and, in addition, finds that the government or aeronautical authorities of the government of the holder, over the objections of the U.S. Government, have: (1) Taken action which impairs, limits, terminates, or denies operating rights, or (2) otherwise denied or failed to prevent the denial of, in whole or in part, the fair and equal opportunity to exercise the operating rights, provided for in such air transport agreement, of any U.S. air carrier designated thereunder with respect to flight operations to, from, through, or over the territory of such foreign government.

            (d) The carrier may continue to operate existing schedules, and may inaugurate operations under proposed schedules 30 days after the filing of such schedules with the Department, unless the Department with or without hearing issues an order, subject to stay or disapproval by the President of the United States within 10 days after adoption, notifying the carrier that such operations, or any part of them, may be contrary to applicable law or may adversely affect the public interest. If the notification pertains to a proposed schedule, service under such schedule shall not be inaugurated; if the notification pertains to existing schedules, service under such schedules shall be discontinued on the date specified in the Department's order. Such date shall be not less than ten days after adoption of the Department's order unless affirmative Presidential approval is obtained at an earlier date.
            (e) No petitions for reconsideration may be filed with respect to Department orders issued pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section. Nevertheless, if the Department serves a notification under paragraph (d) of this section, the carrier may make application to the Department for approval of any or all existing or proposed schedules, pursuant to the provisions of § 213.5. The Department may with or without hearing withdraw, in whole or in part, its notification at any time and may permit existing or proposed schedules to be operated for such period or periods as the Department may determine.
            (f) The date of service on a foreign air carrier of orders and notifications pursuant to this section shall be the date of mailing thereof, by certified or registered mail, to the agent designated by the foreign air carrier pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 46103 or, if the foreign air carrier has failed to designate an agent, the date of mailing by registered air mail to the foreign air carrier's home office.

            (a) Number of copies and certificate of service. An original and three copies of each schedule, and an original and seven (7) copies of application for approval of schedules (§ 213.3(e)) shall be filed with the Department, each setting forth the names and addresses of the persons, if any, required to be served, and stating that service has been made on all such persons by personal service or by registered or certified mail (if the addressee is located within the United States, its territories and possessions) or by registered air mail (if the addressee is located outside the United States, its territories and possessions) and the date of such service. In the case of service by mail, the date of mailing shall be considered the date of service.
            (b) Pleadings by interested persons. Any interested person may file and serve upon the foreign air carrier a memorandum in opposition to, or in support of, schedules or an application for approval of schedules within 10 days of the filing opposed or supported. All memoranda shall set forth in detail the reasons for the position taken together with a statement of economic data and other matters which it is desired that the Department officially notice, and affidavits stating other facts relied upon. Memoranda shall contain a certificate of service as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. An executed original and seven (7) true copies shall be filed with the Department's Docket Facility. Unless otherwise provided by the Department, further pleadings will not be entertained.
            (c) Determination and petitions for reconsideration. The Department may make its determination upon the application and other pleadings or, in its discretion, after hearing. Interested persons seeking reconsideration of the Department's determination on an application approval of schedules may file a petition pursuant to Rule 14 of part 302 of this chapter within 10 days of Department action. Any interested person may file an answer in opposition to, or in support of, the petition within 10 days after it is filed. An executed original and 19 copies of such petition for reconsideration or memorandum shall be filed with the Docket Facility. All petitions for reconsideration shall contain a certificate of service in the form prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section. Unless ordered by the Department upon application or upon its own motion, further pleadings will not be entertained.

            § 215.1
            Applicability.
            This part applies to all certified air carriers, commuter air carriers, and foreign direct air carriers and to initial or amended applications for authority, applications for certificate or permit transfers or reissuances, and registration of business names.
          
          
            § 215.2
            Purpose.

            This part sets rules under which direct air carriers may use the names in their operating authorizations and change those names. It further provides for notification to air carriers that may be affected by the use by other air carriers of the same or similar names. Its purpose is to place the responsibility for resolving private disputes about the use of similar names with the air carriers involved, through recourse to the trade names statutes and the courts. These rules do not preclude Department intervention or enforcement action should there be evidence of a significant potential for, or of actual, public confusion.
          
          
            § 215.3
            Use of name.
            In holding out to the public and in performing air transportation services, a direct air carrier or foreign direct air carrier subject to this part shall use only the name in which its operating authorization is issued or trade name is registered, and shall not operate or hold out to the public in a name not acknowledged by the Department to be so registered. Minor variations in the use of this name, including abbreviations, contractions, initial letters, or other variations of the name that are identifiable with the authorized name, are permitted. Slogans and service marks shall not be considered names for the purpose of this part, and their use is not restricted.

            § 215.4
            Change of name or use of trade name.
            (a) Registrations. Any air carrier subject to this part that desires to change the name in which its operating authorization has been issued, or to use a trade name, or to obtain initial operating authority must register the name with the Department. The Department will construe any application for initial, reissued, or transferred authority as containing a “registration” of the intended name. A separate name registration document need not be filed. A carrier registering use of a trade name, without seeking reissuance of its underlying certificate commuter or foreign air carrier permit or exemption authority, must file a statement that complies with §§ 302.3 and 302.4 of this chapter registering its intended name with the Air Carrier Fitness Division if it is a U.S. certificated or commuter carrier, or within the Licensing Division if it is a foreign air carrier.
            (b) Montreal Agreement. Each registration under this section shall be accompanied by three copies of a counterpart to the Montreal Agreement (Agreement 18900) (OST Form 4523) signed by the carrier using the proposed name. Upon arrival of the application, the Department will place a copy of the signed OST form 4523 in Docket 17325.

            § 215.5
            Procedure in case of similarity of names.
            The Department will compare the proposed name in any registration filed under this part or in an application for new, reissued, or transferred authority with a list of names used by existing certificated, commuter and foreign direct air carriers. The Department will notify the applicant of any other certificated, foreign or commuter carriers that may have an identical or similar name. The registrant must then notify those carriers of its registration. The notification will identify the applicant and state its proposed name or the name requested, area of operation or proposed area of operation, type of business, and other pertinent matters. The registrant must then file a certificate of service of the notification with the Department.
          
          
            § 215.6
            Acknowledgment of registration.
            After completion of the filing and notification requirements of this part, the Department may acknowledge the registration by notice in the action granting the application for initial operating authority, transfer, or reissuance or by separate notice in the case of use of a trade name. Non-action under this provision shall not be construed as an adjudication of any rights or liabilities.

            § 216.1
            Definitions.
            (a) As used in this part, unless the context otherwise requires:
            
              Act means the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended.
            
              Blind sector traffic means revenue traffic, carried by a foreign air carrier on a flight operating in air transportation, which is enplaned at one foreign point and deplaned at another foreign point, where at least one of such points is not named as a terminal or intermediate point in the carrier's applicable foreign air carrier permit.
            
            
              Note:

              This definition shall not be deemed to include the carriage of authorized beyond homeland traffic (i.e., traffic carried between a point named in a carrier's foreign air carrier permit and a point beyond a homeland terminal point authorized under such permit).
            
            
            
              Revenue traffic means persons, property or mail carried for compensation or hire.

            (b) Terms defined in section 101 of the Act have the meaning expressed in such definitions.
            
          
          
            § 216.2
            Applicability.

            This part sets forth the requirements applicable to foreign air carriers for obtaining a Special Authorization from the Board with respect to any deviation from an authorized foreign air transportation route for the purpose of commingling blind sector traffic with air transportation traffic carried pursuant to a foreign air carrier permit issued by the Board. The deviation by a foreign air carrier from its authorized route for the purpose of combined carriage to or from the United States of nonrevenue or other traffic, the carriage of which does not constitute engaging in foreign air transportation, is governed by the provisions of part 375 of this chapter.
            
          
          
            § 216.3
            Prohibition.
            No foreign air carrier shall carry any blind sector traffic, as defined in this part, on any flight operating in air transportation pursuant to the authority of a foreign air carrier permit issued under section 402 of the Act, unless the combined carriage of such traffic has been specifically authorized by such permit, or by a Special Authorization issued under § 216.4.
          
          
            § 216.4
            Special authorizations.
            (a) Applications. Any foreign air carrier may apply to the Board for a Special Authorization, as required by this part, for the carriage of blind sector traffic on a particular flight, series of flights, or for a specified or indefinite period of time between specified points. Applications shall be submitted directly to the Board, addressed to the attention of the Director, Bureau of International Aviation. One original and two copies in conformity with the requirements of §§ 302.3(b) and 302.4 (a) and (b) of this chapter shall be filed. The applications shall contain a proper identification of the applicant; the flight or flights upon which it is proposed to carry such blind sector traffic, including routing, nontraffic stops, and dates or duration of the authority sought; a full description of such traffic, and points between which such traffic will be carried; information or documentation as to whether the country of which the applicant is a national grants reciprocal privileges to U.S. carriers; and the reasons for requesting such authorization together with such additional information as will establish that the grant of such authority will otherwise be in the public interest. Such additional information as may be specifically requested by the Board shall also be furnished.
            (b) Service. Applications shall be served upon each direct U.S. air carrier certificated to engage in individually ticketed or waybilled foreign air transportation over any portion of the route to which the application pertains, and on such other persons as the Board may require, and proof of such service shall accompany the application as provided in § 302.7 of this chapter. Notice of such applications shall also be published in the Board's Weekly List of Applications Filed.
            (c) Memoranda in support or opposition. Any interested person may file a memorandum in support of or in opposition to the grant of an application. Such memorandum shall set forth in detail the reasons why it is believed that the application should be granted or denied and shall be accompanied by such data, including affidavits, which it is desired that the Board consider. Copies of the memorandum shall be served upon the applicant. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed to preclude the Board from granting or denying an application when the circumstances so warrant without awaiting the filing of memoranda in support of or in opposition to the application.
            (d) Time for filing. (1) Applications seeking authority to engage in blind sector operations for a period of 3 months or longer, shall be submitted at least 60 days in advance of the proposed commencement of such operations. Memoranda in response to such an application shall be submitted within 15 days after the date of filing thereof.

            (2) Applications seeking authority to engage in blind sector operations for a period less than three months shall be filed at least 20 days in advance of the proposed commencement of such operations, and memoranda in response thereto within 7 days after the date of filing thereof: Provided, That the Board may consider late filed applications upon a showing of good cause for failure to adhere to this requirement.
            (e) General procedural requirements. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of part 302, subpart A, of this chapter shall apply to the extent applicable.
            (f) Issuance of Special Authorization. A Special Authorization authorizing the carriage of blind sector traffic will be issued only if the Board finds that the proposed carriage is fully consistent with applicable law and this part, and that grant of such authority would be in the public interest. The application may be granted or denied in whole or in part without hearing, and a Special Authorization made subject to any conditions or limitations, to the extent that such action is deemed by the Board to be in the public interest. Special Authorizations are not transferable.
            (g) Nature of the privilege conferred. A Special Authorization issued pursuant to this section shall constitute a privilege conferred upon a carrier, which may be enjoyed only to the extent that its continued exercise remains in the interest of the public. Accordingly, any Special Authorization issued pursuant to this section may be revoked, suspended, amended or restricted without hearing.

Such permits shall, upon the effective date of this part, be deemed to constitute a Special Authorization issued pursuant to § 216.4.
          
          
            § 216.6
            Existing unauthorized operations.

            Notwithstanding the provisions of § 216.3, if within 30 days after the effective date of this part a carrier files an application for a Special Authorization to continue to perform existing blind sector operations which have been regularly performed by such carrier commencing on a date prior to August 9, 1967, such carrier may continue to engage in such blind sector operations until final decision by the Board on such application: Provided, That any such application shall, in addition to the requirements of § 216.4(a), contain a statement that the carrier is relying upon this section for continuance of preexisting blind sector operations, and shall fully describe such operations including the date inaugurated, and the frequency and continuity of performance.

              Appendix to Section 217.10 of 14 CFR Part 217—Instructions to Foreign Air Carriers for Reporting Traffic Data on Form 41 Schedule T-100(f)
              (a) General instructions.
              (1) Description. Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) provides flight stage data covering both passenger/cargo and all cargo operations in scheduled and nonscheduled services. The schedule is used to report all flights which serve points in the United States or its territories as defined in this part.
              (2) Applicability. Each foreign air carrier holding a § 41302 permit or exemption authority shall file Schedule T-100(f).
              (3) Reports required by this section shall be submitted to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in a format specified in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Director of Airline Information.
              (4) Filing period. Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) shall be filed monthly and is due at the Department thirty (30) days following the end of the reporting month to which the data are applicable.
              (5) Number of copies. A single set of legible Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) data and certification shall be submitted.
              (6) Foreign air carrier certification. Each foreign air carrier shall submit a certification statement (illustrated at the end of this Appendix) as an integral part of each monthly Schedule T-100(f), as prescribed in § 217.5 of this part.
              (7) [Reserved]
              (b) Preparation of Form 41 Schedule T-100(f):
              (1) Explanation of nonstop segments and on-flight markets. There are two basic categories of data, one pertaining to nonstop segments and the other pertaining to on-flight markets. For example, the routing (A-B-C-D) consists of three nonstop segment records A-B, B-C, and C-D, and six on-flight market records A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, and C-D.
              (2) Guidelines for reporting a nonstop segment. A nonstop segment is reported when one or both points are in the United States or its territories. These data shall be merged with that for all of the other reportable nonstop operations over the same segment. Nonstop segment data must be summarized by aircraft type, under paragraph (h)(1), and class of service, paragraph (g)(1)(v).

              (3) Rules for determining a reportable on-flight market. On-flight markets are reportable when one or both points are within the U.S., with the following exceptions: (i) Do not report third country to U.S. markets resulting from flight itineraries which serve a third country prior to a homeland point in flights passing through the homeland bound for the U.S.; and (ii) do not report U.S. to third country markets resulting from itineraries serving third country points subsequent to a homeland point in flights outbound from the U.S. and passing through the homeland. In reporting data pertaining to these two exceptions, the traffic moving to or from the U.S. relating to the applicable prior or subsequent third countries (referred to as “behind” or “beyond” traffic) is to be combined with the applicable foreign homeland gateway point, just as though the traffic were actually enplaned or deplaned at the homeland gateway, without disclosure of the actual prior or subsequent points. Applicable flights are illustrated in examples (6) and (7) under paragraph (c).
              
              (c) Examples of flights. Following are some typical flight itineraries that show the reportable nonstop segment and on-flight market entries. The carrier's homeland is the key factor in determining which on-flight markets are reportable.

              (1) SQ flight # 11 LAX—NRT—SIN. This is an example of a flight with an intermediate foreign country. It is not necessary to report anything on the NRT—SIN leg.

This flight serves two homeland points and two different foreign countries before terminating in the U.S. Nonstop segment information is required only for the nonstop segment involving a U.S. point. On-flight market information is required in 4 of the 10 markets, LPB-MIA and VVI-MIA, since these involve homeland and U.S. points; MAO-MIA is necessary to show traffic carried into the U.S., and CCS-MIA for the same reason, and also because in all cases where a nonstop segment entry is required, a corresponding on-flight market entry must also be reported.

              (d) Provisions to reduce paperwork:
              (1) Nonstop Segment Entries. The flight stage data applicable to nonstop segment entries must be summarized to create totals by aircraft equipment type, within service class, within pairs-of-points.
              (2) On-flight Market Entries. The applicable on-flight market entries shall be summarized to create totals by service class within pair-of-points.
              (e) Preparation of Schedule T-100 (f):
              (1) Section A—Indicative and flight pattern information. A copy of Schedule T-100(f) is shown at the end of this Appendix. Section A defines the origin and destination points and the service class code to which the nonstop segment data in Section B and the on-flight market data in Section C are applicable. Section A information, along with the carrier code and report date, must be included on each schedule.

              (2) Section B—Nonstop segment information. Section B of the schedule is used for reporting nonstop segment information by aircraft type. To reduce the number of schedules reported, space is provided for including data on multiple different aircraft types. Similarly, the on-flight market section has been included on a single Schedule T-100(f), along with the nonstop segment data, rather than on a separate schedule.
              (3) Section C—On-flight market information. Section C of the schedule is used for reporting on-flight market data. There will always be an on-flight market that corresponds to the nonstop segment. Because the on-flight market data are reported at the service class level rather than by aircraft type, a specific flight may produce more on-flight markets than nonstop segments, (see examples in paragraph (c) of this Appendix), resulting in data reported in sections A and C only.
              (f) [Reserved]
              (g) Data element definitions:
              (1) Service pattern information.
              (i) Line A-1 Carrier code. Use the carrier code established by the Department. This code is provided to each carrier in the initial reporting letter from the Office of Airline Information (OAI). If there are any questions about these codes, contact the OAI Data Administration Division at the address in paragraph (a)(3) of this Appendix.
              (ii) Line A-2 Report date. This is the year and month to which the data are applicable. For example, 200009 indicates the year 2000, and the month of September.

              (iii) Line A-3 Origin airport code. This is the departure airport, where an aircraft begins a flight segment, and where the passengers originate in an on-flight market. Use the 3-letter code from the City/Airport Codes section of the Official Airline Guide Worldwide Edition. If no 3-letter code is available, OAI will assign one; the address is in paragraph (a)(3) of this Appendix.
              (iv) Line A-4 Destination airport code. This is the arrival airport, where an aircraft stops on a flight segment, and where passengers deplane (get off the flight) after reaching their destination in a market. Use the 3-letter code from the source described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this Appendix.

              (v) Line A-5 Service class code. Select one of the following single letter codes which describes the type of service being reported on a given flight operation.
              
              F = Scheduled Passenger/cargo Service
              G = Scheduled All-cargo Service
              L = Nonscheduled Civilian Passenger/Cargo Charter
              P = Nonscheduled Civilian All-Cargo Charter
              Q = Nonscheduled Services (Other than Charter)
              
              (2) Nonstop segment information:
              (i) Line B-1 Aircraft type code. Use the four digit numeric code prescribed in paragraph (h)(1) of this Appendix. If no aircraft type code is available, OAI will assign one. The address is in paragraph (a)(3) of this Appendix.
              (ii) Line B-2 Aircraft departures performed. This is the total number of physical departures performed with a given aircraft type, within service class and pair-of-points.
              (iii) Line B-3 Revenue passengers transported. This is the total number of revenue passengers transported on a given nonstop segment. It represents the total number of revenue passengers on board over the segment without regard to their actual point of enplanement.
              (iv) Line B-4 Revenue freight transported. This item is the total weight in kilograms (kg) of the revenue freight transported on a given nonstop segment without regard to its actual point of enplanement.
              (3) On-flight market information:
              (i) Line C-1 Total revenue passengers in market. This item represents the total number of revenue passengers, within service class, that were enplaned at the origin airport and deplaned at the destination airport.
              (ii) Line C-2 Total revenue freight in market. This item represents the total weight in kilograms (kg) of revenue freight enplaned at the origin and deplaned at the destination airport.
              (h) [Reserved]
              (i) Joint Service.
              (1) The Department may authorize joint service operations between two direct air carriers. Examples of these joint service operations are:
              Blocked-space agreements;
              Part-charter agreements;
              Code-sharing agreements;
              Wet-lease agreements, and similar arrangements.
              (2) Joint-service operations shall be reported on BTS Form 41 Schedules T-100 and T-100(f) by the air carrier in operational control of the flight, i.e., the air carrier that uses its flight crew to perform the operation. If there are questions about reporting a joint-service operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director—Airline Information at the address in paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix.

            § 218.1
            Definitions.
            For the purpose of this part the term lease shall mean an agreement under which an aircraft is furnished by one party to the agreement to the other party, irrespective of whether the agreement constitutes a true lease, charter arrangement, or some other arrangement.
          
          
            § 218.2
            Applicability.
            This part applies to foreign air carriers and other persons not citizens of the United States which, as lessors or lessees, enter into agreements providing for the lease of aircraft with crew to a foreign air carrier for use in foreign air transportation. For purposes of section 402 of the Act, the person who has operational control and safety responsibility is deemed to be the carrier, and is required to have appropriate operating authority.

            § 218.3
            Prohibition against unauthorized operations employing aircraft leased with crew.
            (a) No foreign air carrier, or other person not a citizen of the United States, shall lease an aircraft with crew to a foreign air carrier for use by the latter in performing foreign air transportation unless either:
            (1) The lessor holds a foreign air carrier permit issued under section 402 of the Act or an approved registration issued under part 294 of this chapter, and any statement of authorization required by part 212 of this chapter; or
            (2) The Board has issued an exemption under section 416 of the Act specifically authorizing the lessor to engage in the foreign air transportation to be performed under the lease; or
            (3) The Board has issued an order under § 218.6 disclaiming jurisdiction over the matter.
            (b) For purposes of this part, an aircraft shall be considered to be leased with crew if:
            (1) The pilot in command or a majority of the crew of the aircraft, other than cabin attendants:
            (i) Is to be furnished by the lessor;
            (ii) Is employed by the lessor;
            (iii) Continues in the employ of the lessor in the operation of services other than those provided for in the agreement between the parties; or
            (iv) Has been employed by the lessor prior to the lease, and the employment of whom by the lessee is coextensive with the period or periods for which the aircraft is available to the lessee under the lease; or
            (2) The aircraft is operated under operations specifications issued to the lessor by the Federal Aviation Administration.
            [ER-716, 36 FR 23148, Dec. 4, 1971, as amended by ER-1250, 46 FR 47770, Sept. 30, 1981; ER-1260, 46 FR 52598, Oct. 27, 1981]
          
          
            § 218.4
            Condition upon authority of lessee.

            In any case where a foreign air carrier leases from another foreign air carrier or other person not a citizen of the United States an aircraft with crew for use in performing foreign air transportation, it shall be a condition upon the authority of the lessee to perform such foreign air transportation that compliance be achieved with the requirements of this part.
          
          
            § 218.5
            Application for disclaimer of jurisdiction.
            The parties to a lease with crew as described in § 218.3(b) may apply to the Board for an order disclaiming jurisdiction over the matter. The application shall be filed jointly by both parties to the lease, and shall generally conform to the procedural requirements of part 302, subpart A, of this chapter. It shall be served upon any air carrier providing services over all or any part of the route upon which air transportation services will be provided pursuant to the agreement. The application should set forth in detail all evidence and other factors relied upon to demonstrate that true operational control and safety responsibility for the air transportation services to be provided are in the hands of the lessee rather than the lessor. A copy of the agreement and all amendments thereof, as well as a summary interpretation of its pertinent provisions, shall be included with the applications. Any interested person may file an answer to the application within 7 days after service hereof. Until the Board has acted upon the application, no operations in foreign transportation shall be performed pursuant to the agreement.
          
          
            § 218.6
            Issuance of order disclaiming jurisdiction.

            If the Board finds that true operational control and safety responsibility will be vested in the lessee and not in the lessor (i.e., that the lease transaction is in substance a true lease of aircraft rather than a charter or series of charters), and that the performance of the operations provided for in such lease will not result in the lessor's being engaged in foreign air transportation, it will issue an order disclaiming jurisdiction over the matter. Otherwise the application for disclaimer of jurisdiction will be denied.
          
          
            § 218.7
            Presumption.
            Whether under a particular lease agreement the lessor of the aircraft is engaged in foreign air transportation is a question of fact to be determined in the light of all the facts and circumstances. However, in circumstances where the lessor furnishes both the aircraft and the crew, there is a presumption that true operational control and safety responsibility are exercised by the lessor, and that the agreement constitutes a charter arrangement under which the lessor is engaged in foreign air transportation. The burden shall rest upon the applicants for disclaimer of jurisdiction in each instance to demonstrate by an appropriate factual showing that the operation contemplated will not constitute foreign air transportation by the lessor.

              (e) Statement of rules. The rules and regulations of each tariff shall be clear, explicit and definite, and except as otherwise provided in this part, shall contain:

              (1) Such explanatory statements regarding the fares, charges, rules or other provisions contained in the tariff as may be necessary to remove all doubt as to their application.
              
              (2) All of the terms, conditions, or other provisions which affect the fares or charges for air transportation named in the tariff.
              (3) All provisions and charges which in any way increase or decrease the amount to be paid by any passenger, or which in any way increase or decrease the value of the services rendered to the passenger.
              (f) Separate rules tariff. If desired, rules and regulations may be published in separate governing tariffs to the extent authorized and in the manner required by subpart G.
              (g) Rules of limited application. A rule affecting only a particular fare or other provision in the tariff shall be specifically referred to in connection with such fare or other provision, and such rule shall indicate that it is applicable only in connection with such fare or other provision. Such rule shall not be published in a separate governing rules tariff.
              (h) Conflicting or duplicating rules prohibited. The publication of rules or regulations which duplicate or conflict with other rules or regulations published in the same or any other tariff for account of the same carrier or carriers and applicable to or in connection with the same transportation is prohibited.
              (i) Each tariff shall include:
              (1) A prominent D.O.T. or other number identifying the tariff in the sequence of tariffs published by the carrier or issuing agent;
              (2) The name of the issuing carrier or agent;
              (3) The cancellation of any tariffs superseded by the tariff;

              (6) The date on which the tariff is issued;
              (7) The date on which the tariff provisions will become effective; and

Such waivers shall only be considered where electronic filing, compared to paper filing, is impractical and will produce a significant economic hardship for the carrier due to the limited nature of the carrier's operations subject to the requirements of this part, or other unusual circumstances. Paper filings pursuant to this paragraph shall normally conform to the requirements of § 221.195 and other applicable requirements of this part.

              Rules and regulations governing passenger fares and services.
              (a) Tariff rules and regulations governing passenger fares and services other than those subject to § 221.30 may be filed electronically in conformity with subpart R. Such filings shall conform to criteria approved by the Department's Office of International Aviation as provided in § 221.180 and shall contain at a minimum the information required by § 221.202(b)(9).

            Subpart E—Contents of Tariff
            
              § 221.40
              Specific requirements.
              (a) In addition to the general requirements in § 221.20, the rules and regulations of each tariff shall contain:
              (1) Aircraft and seating. For individually ticketed passenger service, the name of each type of aircraft used in rendering such service by manufacturer model designation and a description of the seating configuration (or configurations if there are variations) of each type of aircraft. Where fares are provided for different classes or types of passenger service (that is, first class, coach, day coach, night coach, tourist, economy or whatever other class or type of service is provided under the tariff), the tariff shall specify the type of aircraft and the seating configuration used on such aircraft for each class or type of passenger service. When two or more classes or types of passenger service are performed in a single aircraft, the seating configuration for each type or class shall be stated and described.
              (2) Rule numbers. Each rule or regulation shall have a separate designation. The same designation shall not be assigned to more than one rule in the tariff.
              (3) Penalties. Where a rule provides a charge in the nature of a penalty, the rule shall state the exact conditions under which such charge will be imposed.
              (4) Vague or indefinite provisions. Rules and regulations shall not contain indefinite statements to the effect that traffic of any nature will be “taken only by special arrangements”, or that services will be performed or penalties imposed “at carrier's option”, or that the carrier “reserves the right” to act or to refrain from acting in a specified manner, or other provisions of like import; instead, the rules shall state definitely what the carrier will or will not do under the exact conditions stated in the rules.
              (5) Personal liability rules. Except as provided in this part, no provision of the Department's regulations issued under this part or elsewhere shall be construed to require the filing of any tariff rules stating any limitation on, or condition relating to, the carrier's liability for personal injury or death. No subsequent regulation issued by the Department shall be construed to supersede or modify this rule of construction except to the extent that such regulation shall do so in express terms.
              (6) Notice of limitation of liability for death or injury under the Warsaw Convention. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, each air carrier and foreign air carrier shall publish in its tariffs a provision stating whether it avails itself of the limitation on liability to passengers as provided in Article 22(1) of the Warsaw Convention or whether it has elected to agree to a higher limit of liability by a tariff provision. Unless the carrier elects to assume unlimited liability, its tariffs shall contain a statement as to the applicability and effect of the Warsaw Convention, including the amount of the liability limit in dollars. Where applicable, a statement advising passengers of the amount of any higher limit of liability assumed by the carrier shall be added.
              (7) Extension of credit. Air carriers and foreign air carriers shall not file tariffs that set forth charges, rules, regulations, or practices relating to the extension of credit for payment of charges applicable to air transportation.
              (8) Individual carrier provisions governing joint fares. Provisions governing joint fares may be published for account of an individual carrier participating in such joint fares provided that the tariff clearly indicates how such individual carrier's provisions apply to the through transportation over the applicable joint routes comprised of such carrier and other carriers who either do not maintain such provisions or who maintain different provisions on the same subject matter.
              (9) Passenger property which cannot lawfully be carried in the aircraft cabin. Each air carrier shall set forth in its tariffs governing the transportation of persons, including passengers' baggage, charges, rules, and regulations providing that such air carrier receiving as baggage any property of a person traveling in air transportation, which property cannot lawfully be carried by such person in the aircraft cabin by reason of any Federal law or regulation, shall assume liability to such person, at a reasonable charge and subject to reasonable terms and conditions, within the amount declared to the air carrier by such person, for the full actual loss or damage to such property caused by such air carrier.
              (b) [Reserved]
            
            
              
              § 221.41
              Routing.
              (a) Required routing. The route or routes over which each fare applies shall be stated in the tariff in such manner that the following information can be definitely ascertained from the tariff:
              (1) The carrier or carriers performing the transportation,
              (2) The point or points of interchange between carriers if the route is a joint route (via two or more carriers),
              (3) The intermediate points served on the carrier's or carriers' routes applicable between the origin and destination of the fare and the order in which such intermediate points are served.
              (b) Individually stated routings—Method of publication. The routing required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be shown directly in connection with each fare or charge for transportation, or in a routing portion of the tariff (following the fare portion of the tariff), or in a governing routing tariff. When shown in the routing portion of the tariff or in a governing routing tariff, the fare from each point of origin to each point of destination shall bear a routing number and the corresponding routing numbers with their respective explanations of the applicable routings shall be arranged in numerical order in the routing portion of the tariff or in the governing routing tariff.
            
          
          
            Subpart F—Requirements Applicable to All Statements of Fares and Charges
            
              § 221.50
              Currency.
              (a) Statement in United States currency required. All fares and charges shall be stated in cents or dollars of the United States except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (b) Statements in both United States and foreign currencies permitted. Fares and charges applying between points in the United States, on the one hand, and points in foreign countries, on the other hand, or applying between points in foreign countries, may also be stated in the currencies of foreign countries in addition to being stated in United States currency as required by paragraph (a) of this section: Provided, that:
              (1) The fares and charges stated in currencies of countries other than the United States are substantially equivalent in value to the respective fares and charges stated in cents or dollars of the United States.
              (2) Each record containing fares and charges shall clearly indicate the respective currencies in which the fares and charges thereon are stated, and
              (3) The fares and charges stated in cents or dollars of the United States are published separately from those stated in currencies of other countries. This shall be done in a systematic manner and the fares and charges in the respective currencies shall be published in separate records.
            
            
              § 221.51

              (a) Specific points of origin and destination. Except as otherwise provided in this part, the specific points of origin and destination from and to which the fares apply shall be specifically named directly in connection with the respective fares.
              (b) Directional application. A tariff shall specifically indicate directly in connection with the fares therein whether they apply “from” and “to” or “between” the points named. Where the fares apply in one direction, the terms “From” and “To” shall be shown in connection with the point of origin and point of destination, respectively, and, where the fares apply in both directions between the points, the terms “Between” and “And” shall be shown in connection with the respective points.
            
            
              § 221.52

              § 221.53
              Proportional fares.
              (a) Definite application. Add-on fares shall be specifically designated as “add-on” fares on each page where they appear.

              (b) A tariff may provide that fares from (or to) particular points shall be determined by the addition of add-ons to, or the deduction of add-ons from, fares therein which apply from (or to) a base point. Provisions for the addition or deduction of such add-ons shall be shown either directly in connection with the fare applying to or from the base point or in a separate provision which shall specifically name the base point. The tariff shall clearly and definitely state the manner in which such add-ons shall be applied.
              (c) Restrictions upon beyond points or connecting carriers. If an add-on fare is intended for use only on traffic originating at and/or destined to particular beyond points or is to apply only in connection with particular connecting carriers, such application shall be clearly and explicitly stated directly in connection with such add-on fare.
            
            
              § 221.54
              Fares stated in percentages of other fares; other relationships prohibited.
              (a) Fares for foreign air transportation of persons or property shall not be stated in the form of percentages, multiples, fractions, or other relationships to other fares except to the extent authorized in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section with respect to passenger fares and baggage charges.

              (d) Children's, infants' and senior citizen's fares, may be stated, by rule, as percentages of other fares published specifically in dollars and cents (hereinafter referred to as base fares): Provided, that:
              (1) Fares stated as percentages of base fares shall apply from and to the same points, via the same routes, and for the same class of service and same type of aircraft to which the applicable base fares apply, and shall apply to all such base fares in a fares tariff.
              (2) Fares shall not be stated as percentages of base fares for the purpose of establishing fares applying from and to points, or via routes, or on types of aircraft, or for classes of service different from the points, routes, types of aircraft, or classes of service to which the base fares are applicable.
            
            
              § 221.55
              Conflicting or duplicating fares prohibited.
              The publication of fares or charges of a carrier which duplicate or conflict with the fares of the same carrier published in the same or any other tariff for application over the same route or routes is hereby prohibited.
            
            
              § 221.56
              Applicable fare when no through local or joint fares.
              Where no applicable local or joint fare is provided from point of origin to point of destination over the route of movement, whichever combination of applicable fares provided over the route of movement produces the lowest charge shall be applicable, except that a carrier may provide explicitly that a fare cannot be used in any combination or in a combination on particular traffic or under specified conditions, provided another combination is available.
            
          
          
            Subpart G—Governing Tariffs

              When reference to governing tariffs permitted.
              (a) Reference to other tariffs prohibited except as authorized. A tariff shall not refer to nor provide that it is governed by any other tariff, document, or publication, or any part thereof, except as specifically authorized by this part.
              (b) Reference by fare tariff to governing tariffs. A fare tariff may be made subject to a governing tariff or governing tariffs authorized by this subpart: Provided, that reference to such governing tariffs is published in the fare tariff in the manner required by § 221.20(h).
              (c) Participation in governing tariffs. A fare tariff may refer to a separate governing tariff authorized by this subpart only when all carriers participating in such fare tariff are also shown as participating carriers in the governing tariff: Provided, that:

              (1) If such reference to a separate governing tariff does not apply for account of all participating carriers and is restricted to apply only in connection with local or joint fares applying over routes consisting of only particular carriers, only the carriers for whom such reference is published are required to be shown as participating carriers in the governing tariff to which such qualified reference is made.
              
              (2) [Reserved]
              (d) Maximum number of governing tariffs. A single fare tariff shall not make reference to conflicting governing tariffs.
            
            
              § 221.61
              Rules and regulations governing foreign air transportation.
              Instead of being included in the fares tariffs, the rules and regulations governing foreign air transportation required to be filed by §§ 221.20 and 221.30 and/or Department order which do not govern the applicability of particular fares may be filed in separate governing tariffs, conforming to this subpart. Governing rules tariffs shall contain an index of rules.
            
            
              § 221.62
              Explosives and other dangerous or restricted articles.
              Carriers may publish rules and regulations governing the transportation of explosives and other dangerous or restricted articles in separate governing tariffs, conforming to this subpart, instead of being included in the fares tariffs or in the governing rules tariff authorized by § 221.61. This separate governing tariff shall contain no other rules or governing provisions.
            
            
              § 221.63
              Other types of governing tariffs.

            Subpart H—Amendment of Tariffs
            
              § 221.70
              Who may amend tariffs.

              § 221.71
              Requirement of clarity and specificity.
              Amendments to tariffs shall identify with specificity and clarity the material being amended and the changes being made. Amendments to paper tariffs shall be accomplished by reissuing each page upon which a change occurs with the change made and identified by uniform amendment symbols. Each revised page shall identify and cancel the previously effective page, show the effective date of the previous page, and show the intended effective date of the revised page. Amendments in electronic format shall conform to the requirements of § 221.202 and other applicable provisions of subpart R.

            Subpart I—Suspension of Tariff Provisions by Department
            
              § 221.80
              Effect of suspension by Department.
              (a) Suspended matter not to be used. A fare, charge, or other tariff provision which is suspended by the Department, under authority of chapter 415 of the statute, shall not be used during the period of suspension specified by the Department's order.
              (b) Suspended matter not to be changed. A fare, charge, or other tariff provision which is suspended by the Department shall not be changed in any respect or withdrawn or the effective date thereof further deferred except by authority of an order or special tariff permission of the Department.
              (c) Suspension continues former matter in effect. If a tariff publication containing matter suspended by the Department directs the cancellation of a tariff or any portion thereof, which contains fares, charges, or other tariff provisions sought to be amended by the suspended matter, such cancellation is automatically suspended for the same period insofar as it purports to cancel any tariff provisions sought to be amended by the suspended matter.
              (d) Matter continued in effect not to be changed. A fare, charge, or other tariff provision which is continued in effect as a result of a suspension by the Department shall not be changed during the period of suspension unless the change is authorized by order or special tariff permission of the Department, except that such matter may be reissued without change during the period of suspension.
            
            
              § 221.81
              Suspension supplement.
              (a) Suspension supplement. Upon receipt of an order of the Department suspending any tariff publication in part or in its entirety, the carrier or agent who issued such tariff publication shall immediately issue and file with the Department a consecutively numbered supplement for the purpose of announcing such suspension.
              (b) The suspension supplement shall not contain an effective date and it shall contain the suspension notice required by paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) Suspension notice. The suspension supplement shall contain a prominent notice of suspension which shall:
              (1) Indicate what particular fares, charges, or other tariff provisions are under suspension,
              (2) State the date to which such tariff matter is suspended,
              (3) State the Department's docket number and order number which suspended such tariff matter, and
              (4) Give specific reference to the tariffs (specifying their D.O.T. or other identifying numbers), original or revised records and paragraphs or provisions which contain the fares, charges, or other tariff provisions continued in effect.
            
            
              § 221.82
              Reissue of matter continued in effect by suspension to be canceled upon termination of suspension.
              When tariff provisions continued in effect by a suspension are reissued during the period of such suspension, the termination of the suspension and the coming into effect of the suspended matter will not accomplish the cancellation of such reissued matter. In such circumstances, prompt action shall be taken by the issuing agent or carrier to cancel such reissued provisions upon the termination of the suspension in order that they will not conflict with the provisions formerly under suspension.
            
            
              § 221.83
              Tariff must be amended to make suspended matter effective.
              (a) When the Department vacates an order which suspended certain tariff matter in full or in part, such matter will not become effective until the termination of the suspension period unless the issuing agent or carrier amends the pertinent tariffs in the manner prescribed in this subpart (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section).
              (b) If the Department vacates its suspension order prior to the original published effective date of the tariff provisions whose suspension is vacated, such provisions will become effective on their published effective date.
            
            
              § 221.84
              Cancellation of suspended matter subsequent to date to which suspended.
              (a) Endeavor to cancel prior to expiration of suspension period. When an order of the Department requires the cancellation of tariff provisions which were suspended by the Department and such cancellation is required to be made effective on or before a date which is after the date to which such tariff provisions were suspended, the issuing carrier or agent shall, if possible, make the cancellation effective prior to the date to which such tariff provisions were suspended.
              (b) When necessary to republish matter continued in effect by suspension. If suspended tariff provisions become effective upon expiration of their suspension period and thereby accomplish the cancellation of the tariff provisions continued in effect by the suspension, the issuing agent or carrier shall republish and reestablish such canceled tariff provisions effective simultaneously with the cancellation of the suspended provisions in compliance with the Department's order. The tariff amendments which reestablish such canceled tariff provisions shall bear reference to this subpart and the Department's order.

              (3) At least 60 days before they are to become effective, for all other tariffs.
              (b) Computing number of days' notice. A tariff publication shall be deemed to be filed only upon its actual receipt by the Department, and the first day of any required period of notice shall be the day of actual receipt by the Department.
              (c) Issued date. All tariff publications must be received by the Department on or before the designated issued date.

              § 221.92
              Number of copies required.

              § 221.93
              Concurrences or powers of attorney not previously filed to accompany tariff transmittal.
              When a tariff is filed on behalf of a carrier participating therein under authority of its concurrence or power of attorney, such concurrence or power of attorney shall, if not previously filed with the Department, be transmitted at the same time such tariff is submitted for filing.
            
            
              § 221.94
              Explanation and data supporting tariff changes and new matter in tariffs.
              When a tariff is filed with the Department which contains new or changed local or joint fares or charges for foreign air transportation, or new or changed classifications, rules, regulations, or practices affecting such fares or charges, or the value of the service thereunder, the issuing air carrier, foreign air carrier, or agent shall submit with the filing of such tariff:
              (a) An explanation of the new or changed matter and the reasons for the filing, including (if applicable) the basis of rate making employed. Where a tariff is filed pursuant to an intercarrier agreement approved by the Department, the explanation shall identify such agreement by DOT Docket number, DOT order of approval number, IATA resolution number, or if none is designated, then by other definite identification. Where a tariff is filed on behalf of a foreign air carrier pursuant to a Government order, a copy of such order shall be submitted with the tariff.
              (b) Appropriate Economic data and/or information in support of the new or changed matter.
              (c) Exceptions. (1) The requirement for data and/or information in paragraph (b) of this section will not apply to tariff publications containing new or changed matter which are filed:
              (i) In response to Department orders or specific policy pronouncements of the Department directly related to such new or changed matter;
              (ii) Pursuant to an intercarrier agreement approved by the Department setting forth the fares, charges (or specific formulas therefor) or other matter: Provided that the changes are submitted with the number of the DOT order of approval and fully comply with any conditions set forth in that order;

              (iii) To the extent fares for scheduled passenger service are within a statutory or Department-established zone of fare flexibility; and
              
              (iv) To meet competition: Provided, that
              (A) Changed matter will be deemed to have been filed to meet competition only when it effects decreases in fares or charges and/or increases the value of service so that the level of the fares or charges and the services provided will be substantially similar to the level of fares or charges and the services of a competing carrier or carriers.
              (B) New matter will be deemed to have been filed to meet competition only when it establishes or affects a fare or charge and a service which will be substantially similar to the fares or charges and the services of a competing carrier or carriers.
              (C) When new or changed matter is filed to meet competition over a portion of the filing air carrier's system and is simultaneously made applicable to the balance of the system, such matter, insofar as it applies over the balance of the system, will be deemed to be within the exception in this paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section only if such carrier submits an explanation as to the necessity of maintaining uniformity over its entire system with respect to such new or changed matter.
              (D) In any case where new or changed matter is filed to meet competition, the filing carrier or agent must supply, as part of the filing justification, the complete tariff references which will serve to identify the competing tariff matter which the tariff purports to meet. In such case the justification or attachment shall state whether the new or changed matter is identical to the competing tariff matter which it purports to meet or whether it approximates the competing tariff matter. If the new or changed matter is not identical, the transmittal letter or attachment shall contain a statement explaining, in reasonable detail, the basis for concluding that the tariff publication being filed is substantially similar to the competing tariff matter.

              Inspection at stations, offices, or locations other than principal or general office.
              (a) Each carrier shall make available for public inspection at each of its stations, offices, or other locations at which tickets for passenger transportation are sold and which is in charge of a person employed exclusively by the carrier, or by it jointly with another person, all tariffs applicable to passenger traffic from or to the point where such station, office, or location is situated, including tariffs covering any terminal services, charges, or practices whatsoever, which apply to passenger traffic from or to such point.
              (b) A carrier will be deemed to have complied with the requirement that it “post” tariffs, if it maintains at each station, office, or location a file in complete form of all tariffs required to be posted; and in the case of tariffs involving passenger fares, rules, charges or practices, notice to the passenger as required in § 221.105.
              (c) Tariffs shall be posted by each carrier party thereto no later than the filed date designated thereon except that in the case of carrier stations, offices or locations situated outside the United States, its territories and possessions, the time shall be not later than five days after the filed date, and except that a tariff which the Department has authorized to be filed on shorter notice shall be posted by the carrier on like notice as authorized for filing.
            
            
              § 221.102
              Accessibility of tariffs to the public.

              Each file of tariffs shall be kept in complete and accessible form.

                Public Inspection of Tariffs
                All the currently effective passenger tariffs to which this company is a party and all passenger tariff publications which have been issued but are not yet effective are on file in this office, so far as they apply to traffic from or to. (Here name the point.) These tariffs may be inspected by any person upon request and without the assignment of any reason for such inspection. The employees of this company on duty in this office will lend assistance in securing information from the tariffs.
                In addition, a complete file of all tariffs of this company, with indexes thereof, is maintained and kept available for public inspection at. (Here indicate the place or places where complete tariff files are maintained, including the street address, and where appropriate, the room number.)
              
            
            
              § 221.105
              Special notice of limited liability for death or injury under the Warsaw Convention.

              (a)(1) In addition to the other requirements of this subpart, each air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself of the limitation on liability to passengers provided by the Warsaw Convention, shall, at the time of delivery of the ticket, furnish to each passenger whose transportation is governed by the Convention and whose place of departure or place of destination is in the United States, the following statement in writing:
              
              
                Advice to International Passengers on Limitations of Liability
                Passengers embarking upon a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure are advised that the provisions of a treaty known as the Warsaw Convention may be applicable to their entire journey including the portion entirely within the countries of departure and destination. The Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury to approximately $10,000.
                Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.
              
              
              (2) Provided, however, That when the carrier elects to agree to a higher limit of liability to passengers than that provided in Article 22(1) of the Warsaw Convention, such statement shall be modified to reflect the higher limit. The statement prescribed herein shall be printed in type at least as large as 10-point modern type and in ink contrasting with the stock on:
              (i) Each ticket;
              (ii) A piece of paper either placed in the ticket envelope with the ticket or attached to the ticket; or
              (iii) The ticket envelope.

              (b) Each air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself of the limitation on liability to passengers provided by the Warsaw Convention, shall also cause to be displayed continuously in a conspicuous public place at each desk, station, and position in the United States which is in the charge of a person employed exclusively by it or by it jointly with another person, or by any agent employed by such air carrier or foreign air carrier to sell tickets to passengers whose transportation may be governed by the Warsaw Convention and whose place of departure or destination may be in the United States, a sign which shall have printed thereon the statement prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section: Provided, however, That an air carrier, except an air taxi operator subject to part 298 of this subchapter, or foreign air carrier which provides a higher limitation of liability than that set forth in the Warsaw Convention and has signed a counterpart of the agreement among carriers providing for such higher limit, which agreement was approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board by Order E-23680, dated May 13, 1966 (31 FR 7302, May 19, 1966), may use the alternate form of notice set forth in the proviso to § 221.106(a) of this chapter in full compliance with the posting requirements of this paragraph. And provided further, That an air taxi operator subject to part 298 of this subchapter, which provides a higher limitation of liability than that set forth in the Warsaw Convention and has signed a counterpart of the agreement among carriers providing for such higher limit, which agreement was approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board by Order E-23680, dated May 13, 1966 (31 FR 7302, May 19, 1966), may use the following notice in the manner prescribed by this paragraph in full compliance with the posting requirements of this paragraph. Such statements shall be printed in bold faced type at least one-fourth of an inch high.
              
              
                Advice to International Passengers on Limitation of Liability
                Passengers traveling to or from a foreign country are advised that airline liability for death or personal injury and loss or damage to baggage may be limited by the Warsaw Convention and tariff provisions. See the notice with your ticket or contact your airline ticket office or travel agent for further information.

              Notice of limited liability for baggage; alternative consolidated notice of liability limitations.

              (a)(1) Each air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself of limitations on liability for loss of, damage to, or delay in delivery of baggage shall cause to be displayed continuously in a conspicuous public place at each desk, station, and position in the United States which is in the charge of a person employed exclusively by it or by it jointly with another person, or by any agent employed by such air carrier or foreign air carrier to sell tickets to persons or accept baggage for checking, a sign which shall have printed thereon the following statement:
              
              
                Notice of Limited Liability for Baggage
                For most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys) liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage unless a higher value is declared and an extra charge is paid. Special rules may apply for valuables. Consult your carrier for details.
              
              

              (2) Provided, however, That an air carrier or foreign air carrier which provides a higher limitation of liability for death or personal injury than that set forth in the Warsaw Convention and has signed a counterpart of the agreement approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board by Order E-23680, dated May 13, 1966 (31 FR 7302, May 19, 1966), may use the following notice in full compliance with the posting requirements of this paragraph and of § 221.105(b):
              
              
                Advice to Passengers on Limitations of Liability
                Airline liability for death or personal injury may be limited by the Warsaw Convention and tariff provisions in the case of travel to or from a foreign country.
                For most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys) liability for loss, delay or damage to baggage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage unless a higher value is declared and an extra charge is paid. Special rules may apply to valuable articles.
                See the notice with your tickets or consult your airline or travel agent for further information.
              
              
              (3) Provided, however, That carriers may include in the notice the parenthetical phrase “($20.00 per kilo)” after the phrase “$9.07 per pound” in referring to the baggage liability limitation for most international travel. Such statements shall be printed in bold-face type at least one-fourth of an inch high and shall be so located as to be clearly visible and clearly readable to the traveling public.

              (b)(1) Each air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself of limitations of liability for loss of, damage to, or delay in delivery of, baggage shall include on or with each ticket issued in the United States or in a foreign country by it or its authorized agent, the following notice printed in at least 10 point type:
              
              
                Notice of Baggage Liability Limitations

                For most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys) liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are paid. Excess valuation may not be declared on certain types of valuable articles. Carriers assume no liability for fragile or perishable articles. Further information may be obtained from the carrier.
              
              
              (2) Provided, however, That carriers may include in their ticket notice the parenthetical phrase “($20.00 per kilo)” after the phrase “$9.07 per pound” in referring to the baggage liability limitation for most international travel.
              (c) It shall be the responsibility of each carrier to insure that travel agents authorized to sell air transportation for such carrier comply with the notice provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
              (d) Any air carrier or foreign air carrier subject to the provisions of this section which wishes to use a notice of limited liability for baggage of its own wording, but containing the substance of the language prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may substitute a notice of its own wording upon approval by the Department.
              (e) The requirements as to time and method of delivery of the notice (including the size of type) specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the requirement with respect to travel agents specified in paragraph (c) of this section may be waived by the Department upon application and showing by the carrier that special and unusual circumstances render the enforcement of the regulations impractical and unduly burdensome and that adequate alternative means of giving notice are employed.
              (f) Applications for relief under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall be filed with the Department's Office of International Aviation not later than 15 days before the date on which such relief is requested to become effective.
              (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no air taxi operator subject to part 298 of this subchapter shall be required to give the notices prescribed in this section, either in its capacity as an air carrier or in its capacity as an agent for an air carrier or foreign air carrier.
            
            
              § 221.107

              (a) Terms incorporated in the contract of carriage. (1) A ticket, or other written instrument that embodies the contract of carriage for foreign air transportation shall contain or be accompanied by notice to the passenger as required in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.

              (2) Each carrier shall make the full text of all terms that are incorporated in a contract of carriage readily available for public inspection at each airport or other ticket sales office of the carrier: Provided, That the medium, i.e., printed or electronic, in which the incorporated terms and conditions are made available to the consumer shall be at the discretion of the carrier.

              (3) Each carrier shall display continuously in a conspicuous public place at each airport or other ticket sales office of the carrier a notice printed in large type reading as follows:
              
              
                Explanation of Contract Terms
                All passenger (and/or cargo as applicable) contract terms incorporated into the contract of carriage to which this company is a party are available in this office. These provisions may be inspected by any person upon request and for any reason. The employees of this office will lend assistance in securing information, and explaining any terms.
                In addition, a file of all tariffs of this company, with indexes thereof, from which incorporated contract terms may be obtained is maintained and kept available for public inspection at. (Here indicate the place or places where tariff files are maintained, including the street address and, where appropriate, the room number.)
              
              
              (4) Each carrier shall provide to the passenger a complete copy of the text of any/all terms and conditions applicable to the contract of carriage, free of charge, immediately, if feasible, or otherwise promptly by mail or other delivery service, upon request at any airport or other ticket sales office of the carrier. In addition, all other locations where the carrier's tickets may be issued shall have available at all times, free of charge, information sufficient to enable the passenger to request a copy of such term(s).
              (b) Notice of incorporated terms. Each carrier and ticket agent shall include on or with a ticket or other written instrument given to the passenger, that embodies the contract of carriage, a conspicuous notice that:
              (1) The contract of carriage may incorporate terms and conditions by reference; passengers may inspect the full text of each applicable incorporated term at any of the carrier's airport locations or other ticket sales offices of the carrier; and passengers, shippers and consignees have the right to receive, upon request at any airport or other ticket sales office of the carrier, a free copy of the full text of any/all such terms by mail or other delivery service;
              (2) The incorporated terms may include, among others, the terms shown in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section. Passengers may obtain a concise and immediate explanation of the terms shown in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section from any location where the carrier's tickets are sold.
              (i) Limits on the carrier's liability for personal injury or death of passengers (subject to § 221.105), and for loss, damage, or delay of goods and baggage, including fragile or perishable goods.
              (ii) Claim restrictions, including time periods within which passengers must file a claim or bring an action against the carrier for its acts or omissions or those of its agents.

              (iv) Rights of the carrier and limitations concerning delay or failure to perform service, including schedule changes, substitution of alternate carrier or aircraft, and rerouting.
              (c) Explanation of incorporated terms. Each carrier shall ensure that any passenger can obtain from any location where its tickets are sold or any similar documents are issued, a concise and immediate explanation of any term incorporated concerning the subjects listed in paragraph (b)(2) or identified in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (d) Direct notice of certain terms. A passenger must receive conspicuous written notice, on or with the ticket, or other similar document, of the salient features of any terms that restrict refunds of the price of the transportation, impose monetary penalties on customers, or permit a carrier to raise the price or impose more restrictive conditions of contract after issuance of the ticket.
            
            
              § 221.108
              Transmission of tariff filings to subscribers.

            Subpart L—Rejection of Tariff Publications
            
              § 221.110
              Department's authority to reject.
              The Department may reject any tariff which is not consistent with section 41504 of the statute, with the regulations in this part, or with Department orders.
            
            
              § 221.111
              Notification of rejection.

              § 221.112
              Rejected tariff is void and must not be used.

            Subpart M—Special Tariff Permission To File on Less Than Statutory Notice
            
              § 221.120
              Grounds for approving or denying Special Tariff Permission applications.
              (a) General authority. The Department may permit changes in fares, charges or other tariff provisions on less than the statutory notice required by section 41505 of the statute.
              (b) Grounds for approval. The following facts and circumstances constitute some of the grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff Permission in the absence of other facts and circumstances warranting denial:
              (1) Clerical or typographical errors. Clerical or typographical errors in tariffs constitute grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice the tariff changes necessary to correct such errors. Each application for Special Tariff Permission based on such grounds shall plainly specify the errors and contain a complete statement of all the attending facts and circumstances, and such application shall be presented to the Department with reasonable promptness after issuance of the defective tariff.
              (2) Rejection caused by clerical or typographical errors or unintelligibility. Rejection of a tariff caused by clerical or typographical errors constitute grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice, effective not earlier than the original effective dates in the rejected tariff, all changes contained in the rejected tariff but with the errors corrected. Each application for the grant of Special Tariff Permission based on such grounds shall plainly specify the errors and contain a complete statement of all the attending facts and circumstances, and such application shall be filed with the Department within five days after receipt of the Department's notice of rejection.
              (3) Newly authorized transportation. The fact that the Department has newly authorized a carrier to perform foreign air transportation constitutes grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice the fares, rates, and other tariff provisions covering such newly authorized transportation.
              (4) The fact that a passenger fare is within a statutory or Department-established zone of fare flexibility constitutes grounds for approving an application for Special Tariff Permission to file a tariff stating that fare and any rules affecting them exclusively, on less than statutory notice. The Department's policy on approving such applications is set forth in § 399.35 of this chapter.
              (5) Lowered fares and charges. The prospective lowering of fares or charges to the traveling public constitutes grounds for approving an application for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice a tariff stating the lowered fares or charges and any rules affecting them exclusively. However, the Department will not approve the application if the proposed tariff raises significant questions of lawfulness, as set forth in § 399.35 of this chapter.
              (c) Filing notice required by formal order. When a formal order of the Department requires the filing of tariff matter on a stated number of days' notice, an application for Special Tariff Permission to file on less notice will not be approved. In any such instance a petition for modification of the order should be filed in the formal docket.
            
            
              § 221.121
              How to prepare and file applications for Special Tariff Permission.
              (a) Form. Each application for Special Tariff Permission to file a tariff on less than statutory notice shall conform to the requirements of § 221.212 if filed electronically.
              (b) Number of paper copies and place of filing. For paper format applications, the original and one copy of each such application for Special Tariff Permission, including all exhibits thereto and amendments thereof, shall be sent to the Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590.
              (c) Who may make application. Applications for Special Tariff Permission to file fares, or other tariff provisions on less than statutory notice shall be made only by the issuing carrier or agent authorized to issue and file the proposed tariff. Such application by the issuing carrier or agent will constitute application on behalf of all carriers participating in the proposed fares, or other tariff provisions.
              (d) When notice is required. Notice in the manner set forth in paragraph (e) of this section is required when a carrier files an application for Special Tariff Permission:
              (1) To offer passenger fares that would be outside a Department-established zone of price flexibility or, in markets for which the Department has not established such a zone, outside the statutory zone of price flexibility; or
              (2) To file any price increase or rule change that the carrier believes is likely to be controversial.
              (e) Form of notice. When notice of filing of a Special Tariff Permission application affecting passenger fares is required by paragraph (d) of this section, the carrier shall, when it files the application, give immediate telegraphic notice or other notice approved by the Office of International Aviation, to all certificated and foreign route carriers authorized to provide nonstop or one-stop service in the markets involved, and to civic parties that would be substantially affected. The application shall include a list of the parties notified.
            
            
              § 221.122
              Special Tariff Permission to be used in its entirety as granted.
              Each Special Tariff Permission to file fares, or other tariff provisions on less than statutory notice shall be used in its entirety as granted. If it is not desired to use the permission as granted, and lesser or more extensive or different permission is desired, a new application for Special Tariff Permission conforming with § 221.121 in all respects and referring to the previous permission shall be filed.
            
            
              § 221.123
              Re-use of Special Tariff Permission when tariff is rejected.
              If a tariff containing matter issued under Special Tariff Permission is rejected, the same Special Tariff Permission may be used in a tariff issued in lieu of such rejected tariff provided that such re-use is not precluded by the terms of the Special Tariff Permission, and is made within the time limit thereof or within seven days after the date of the Department's notice of rejection, whichever is later, but in no event later than fifteen days after the expiration of the time limit specified in the Special Tariff Permission.

              Applications for waiver of tariff regulations.
              Applications for waiver or modification of any of the requirements of this part 221 or for modification of chapter 415 of the statute with respect to the filing and posting of tariffs shall be made by the issuing carrier or issuing agent.
            
            
              § 221.131
              Form of application for waivers.
              Applications for waivers shall be in the form of a letter addressed to the Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation Washington, DC 20590, and shall:
              (a) Specify (by section and paragraph) the particular regulation which the applicant desires the Department to waive.
              (b) Show in detail how the proposed provisions will be shown in the tariff under authority of such waiver if granted (submitting exhibits of the proposed provision where necessary to clearly show this information).
              (c) Set forth all facts and circumstances on which the applicant relies as warranting the Department's granting the authority requested. No tariff or other documents shall be filed pursuant to such application prior to the Department's granting the authority requested.
            
          
          
            
            Subpart O—Giving and Revoking Concurrences to Carriers
            
              § 221.140
              Method of giving concurrence.
              (a) A concurrence prepared in a manner acceptable to the Office of International Aviation shall be used by a carrier to give authority to another carrier to issue and file with the Department tariffs which contain joint fares or charges, including provisions governing such fares or charges, applying to, from, or via points served by the carrier giving the concurrence. A concurrence shall not be used as authority to file joint fares or charges in which the carrier to whom the concurrence is given does not participate, and it shall not be used as authority to file local fares or charges.
              (b) Number of copies. Each concurrence shall be prepared in triplicate. The original of each concurrence shall be filed with the Department, the duplicate thereof shall be given to the carrier in whose favor the concurrence is issued, and the third copy shall be retained by the carrier who issued the concurrence.
              (c) Conflicting authority to be avoided. Care should be taken to avoid giving authority to two or more carriers which, if used, would result in conflicting or duplicate tariff provisions.
            
            
              § 221.141
              Method of revoking concurrence.
              (a) A concurrence may be revoked by filing with the Department a Notice of Revocation of Concurrence prepared in a form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation.
              (b) Sixty days' notice required. Such Notice of Revocation of Concurrence shall be filed on not less than sixty days' notice to the Department. A Notice of Revocation of Concurrence will be deemed to be filed only upon its actual receipt by the Department, and the period of notice shall commence to run only from such actual receipt.
              (c) Number of copies. Each Notice of Revocation of Concurrence shall be prepared in triplicate. The original thereof shall be filed with the Department and, at the same time that the original is transmitted to the Department, the duplicate thereof shall be sent to the carrier to whom the concurrence was given. The third copy shall be retained by the carrier issuing such notice.
              (d) Amendment of tariffs when concurrence revoked. When a concurrence is revoked, a corresponding amendment of the tariff or tariffs affected shall be made by the issuing carrier of such tariffs, on not less than statutory notice, to become effective not later than the effective date stated in the Notice of Revocation of Concurrence. In the event of failure to so amend the tariff or tariffs, the provisions therein shall remain applicable until lawfully canceled.
            
            
              § 221.142
              Method of withdrawing portion of authority conferred by concurrence.
              If a carrier desires to issue a concurrence conferring less authority than a previous concurrence given to the same carrier, the new concurrence shall not direct the cancellation of such previous concurrence. In such circumstances, such previous concurrence shall be revoked by issuing and filing a Notice of Revocation of Concurrence in a form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation. Such revocation notice shall include reference to the new concurrence.
            
          
          
            Subpart P—Giving and Revoking Powers of Attorney to Agents
            
              § 221.150
              Method of giving power of attorney.
              (a) Prescribed form of power of attorney. A power of attorney prepared in accordance with a form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation shall be used by a carrier to give authority to an agent and (in the case of the agent being an individual) such agent's alternate to issue and file with the Department tariffs which contain local or joint fares or charges, including provisions governing such fares or charges, applicable via and for account of such carrier. Agents may be only natural persons or corporations (other than incorporated associations of air carriers). The authority conferred in a power of attorney may not be delegated to any other person.
              
              (b) Designation of tariff issuing person by corporate agent. When a corporation has been appointed as agent it shall forward to the Department a certified excerpt of the minutes of the meeting of its Board of Directors designating by name and title the person responsible for issuing tariffs and filing them with the Department. Only one such person may be designated by a corporate agent, and the title of such designee shall not contain the word “Agent”. When such a designee is replaced the Department shall be immediately notified in like manner of his successor. An officer or employee of an incorporated tariff-publishing agent may not be authorized to act as tariff agent in his/her individual capacity. Every tariff issued by a corporate agent shall be issued in its name as agent.
              (c) Number of copies. Each power of attorney shall be prepared in triplicate. The original of each power of attorney shall be filed with the Department, the duplicate thereof shall be given to the agent in whose favor the power of attorney is issued, and the third copy shall be retained by the carrier who issued the power of attorney.
              (d) Conflicting authority prohibited. In giving powers of attorney, carriers shall not give authority to two or more agents which, if used, would result in conflicting or duplicate tariff provisions.
            
            
              § 221.151
              Method of revoking power of attorney.
              (a) A power of attorney may be revoked only by filing with the Department in the manner specified in this section a Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney in a form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation.
              (b) Sixty days' notice required. Such Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney shall be filed on not less than sixty days' notice to the Department. A Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney will be deemed to be filed only upon its actual receipt by the Department, and the period of notice shall commence to run only from such actual receipt.
              (c) Number of copies. Each Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney shall be prepared in triplicate. The original thereof shall be filed with the Department and, at the same time that the original is transmitted to the Department, the duplicate thereof shall be sent to the agent in whose favor the power of attorney was issued (except, if the alternate agent has taken over the tariffs, the duplicate of the Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney shall be sent to the alternate agent). The third copy of the notice shall be retained by the carrier.
              (d) Amendment of tariffs when power of attorney is revoked. When a power of attorney is revoked, a corresponding amendment of the tariff or tariffs affected shall be made by the issuing agent of such tariffs, on not less than statutory notice, to become effective not later than the effective date stated in the Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney. In the event of failure to so amend the tariff or tariffs, the provisions therein shall remain applicable until lawfully canceled.
            
            
              § 221.152
              Method of withdrawing portion of authority conferred by power of attorney.
              If a carrier desires to issue a power of attorney conferring less authority than a previous power of attorney issued in favor of the same agent, the new power of attorney shall not direct the cancellation of such previous power of attorney. In such circumstances, such previous power of attorney shall be revoked by issuing and filing a Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney in a form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation. Such revocation notice shall include reference to the new power of attorney.
            
          
          
            Subpart Q—Adoption Publications Required To Show Change in Carrier's Name or Transfer of Operating Control
            
              § 221.160
              Adoption notice.

              (a) When the name of a carrier is changed or when its operating control is transferred to another carrier (including another company which has not previously been a carrier), the carrier which will thereafter operate the properties shall immediately issue, file with the Department, and post for public inspection, an adoption notice in a form and containing such information as is approved by the Office of International Aviation. (The carrier under its former name or the carrier from whom the operating control is transferred shall be referred to in this subpart as the “former carrier”, and the carrier under its new name or the carrier, company, or fiduciary to whom the operating control is transferred shall be referred to in this subpart as the “adopting carrier”.)
              (b) The adoption notice shall be prepared, filed, and posted as a tariff. The adoption notice shall be issued and filed by the adopting carrier and not by an agent.
              (c) Copies to be sent to agents and other carriers. At the same time that the adoption notice is transmitted to the Department for filing, the adopting carrier shall send copies of such adoption notice to each agent and carrier to whom the former carrier has given a power of attorney or concurrence. (See § 221.163.)
            
            
              § 221.161
              Notice of adoption to be filed in former carrier's tariffs.
              At the same time that the adoption notice is issued, posted, and filed pursuant to § 221.160, the adopting carrier shall issue, post and file with the Department a notice in each effective tariff issued by the former carrier providing specific notice of the adoption in a manner authorized by the Office of International Aviation and which shall contain no matter other than that authorized.
            
            
              § 221.162
              Receiver shall file adoption notices.
              A receiver shall, immediately upon assuming control of a carrier, issue and file with the Department an adoption notices as prescribed by §§ 221.160 and 221.161 and shall comply with the requirements of this subpart.
            
            
              § 221.163
              Agents' and other carriers' tariffs shall reflect adoption.
              If the former carrier is shown as a participating carrier under concurrence in tariffs issued by other carriers or is shown as a participating carrier under power of attorney in tariffs issued by agents, the issuing carriers and agents of such tariffs shall, upon receipt of the adoption notice, promptly file on statutory notice the following amendments to their respective tariffs:
              (a) Cancel the name of the former carrier from the list of participating carriers.
              (b) Add the adopting carrier (in alphabetical order) to the list of participating carriers. If the adopting carrier already participates in such tariff, reference to the substitution notice shall be added in connection with such carrier's name in the list of participating carriers.
            
            
              § 221.164
              Concurrences or powers of attorney to be reissued.
              (a) Adopting carrier shall reissue adopted concurrences and powers of attorney. Within a period of 120 days after the date on which the change in name or transfer of operating control occurs, the adopting carrier shall reissue all effective powers of attorney and concurrences of the former carrier by issuing and filing new powers of attorney and concurrences, in the adopting carrier's name, which shall direct the cancellation of the respective powers of attorney and concurrences of the former carrier. The adopting carrier shall consecutively number its powers of attorney and concurrences in its own series of power of attorney numbers and concurrence numbers (commencing with No. 1 in each series if it had not previously filed any such instruments with the Department), except that a receiver or other fiduciary shall consecutively number its powers of attorney or concurrences in the series of the former carrier. The cancellation reference shall show that the canceled power of attorney or concurrence was issued by the former carrier.

              (b) If such new powers of attorney or concurrences confer less authority than the powers of attorney or concurrences which they are to supersede, the new issues shall not direct the cancellation of the former issues; in such instances, the provisions of §§ 221.142 and 221.152 shall be observed. Concurrences and powers of attorney which will not be replaced by new issues shall be revoked in the form and manner and upon the notice required by §§ 221.141 and 221.151.
              
              (c) Reissue of other carriers' concurrences issued in favor of former carrier. Each carrier which has given a concurrence to a carrier whose tariffs are subsequently adopted shall reissue the concurrence in favor of the adopting carrier. If the carrier which issued the concurrence to the former carrier desires to revoke it or desires to replace it with a concurrence conferring less authority, the provisions of §§ 221.141 and 221.142 shall be observed.
            
            
              § 221.165
              Cessation of operations without successor.
              If a carrier ceases operations without having a successor, it shall:
              (a) File a notice in each tariff of its own issue and cancel such tariff in its entirety.
              (b) Revoke all powers of attorney and concurrences which it has issued.
            
          
          
            Subpart R—Electronically Filed Tariffs
            
              § 221.170
              Applicability of the subpart.
              (a) Every air carrier and foreign air carrier shall file its international passenger fares tariffs consistent with the provisions of this subpart, and part 221 generally. Additionally, any air carrier and any foreign air carrier may file its international passenger rules tariffs electronically in machine-readable form as an alternative to the filing of printed paper tariffs as provided for elsewhere in part 221. This subpart applies to all carriers and tariff publishing agents and may be used by either if the carrier or agent complies with the provisions of subpart R. Any carrier or agent that files electronically under this subpart must transmit to the Department the remainder of the tariff in a form consistent with part 221, Subparts A through Q, on the same day that the electronic tariff would be deemed received under § 221.190(b).
              (b) To the extent that subpart R is inconsistent with the remainder of part 221, subpart R shall govern the filing of electronic tariffs. In all other respects, part 221 remains in full force and effect.
            
            
              § 221.180

              § 221.212
              Special tariff permission.
              (a) When a filer submits an electronic tariff or an amendment to an electronic tariff for which authority is sought to effect changes on less than bilateral/statutory notice, and no related tariff material is involved, the submission shall bear a sequential filing advice number. The submission shall appear in the Government Filing File and the Filing Advice Status File, and shall be referenced in such a manner to clearly indicate that such changes are sought to be made on less than bilateral/statutory notice.
              (b) When a filer submits an electronic tariff or an amendment to the electronic tariff for which authority is sought to effect changes on less than bilateral/statutory notice, and it contains related paper under § 221.195, the paper submission must bear the same filing advice number as that used for the electronic submission. Such paper submission shall be in the form of a revised tariff page rather than as a separate request for Special Tariff Permission. All material being submitted on a paper tariff page as part of an electronic submission will clearly indicate the portion(s) of such tariff page that is being filed pursuant to, and in conjunction with, the electronic submission on less than bilateral/statutory notice.
              (c) Departmental action on the Special Tariff Permission request shall be noted by the Department in the Government Filing File and the Filing Advice Status File.
              (d) When the paper portion of a Special Tariff Permission that has been filed with the Department pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section is disapproved or other action is taken by the Department, such disapproval or other action will be reflected on the next consecutive revision of the affected tariff page(s) in the following manner:
              (1) Example of disapproval statement:
              
              
                The portion(s) of __ Revised Page __ filed under EFA No. __ was/were disapproved by DOT.
              
              
              (2) Example of other action:
              
              
                The portion(s) __ Revised Page __ filed under EFA No. __ was/were required to be amended by DOT.
              
              
              (e) When the Department disapproves in whole or in part or otherwise takes an action against any submission filed under this part, the filer must take corrective action within two business days following the disapproval or notice of other action.
              (f) All submissions under this section shall comply with the requirements of § 221.202.
            
            
              § 221.300
              Discontinuation of electronic tariff system.
              In the event that the electronic tariff system is discontinued, or the source of the data is changed, or a filer discontinues its business, all electronic data records prior to such date shall be provided immediately to the Department, free of charge, on a machine-readable tape or other mutually acceptable electronic medium.
            
            
              § 221.400
              Filing of paper tariffs required.
              (a) After approval of any application filed under § 221.180 of this subpart to allow a filer to file tariffs electronically, the filer in addition to filing electronically must continue to file printed tariffs as required by subparts A through Q of part 221 for a period of 90 days, or until such time as the Department shall deem such filing no longer to be necessary: Provided that during the period specified by this section the filed printed tariff shall continue to be the official tariff.
              (b) Upon notification to the filer that it may commence to file its tariffs solely in an electronic mode, concurrently with the implementation of filing electronically the filer shall:

              (1) Furnish the Department with a copy of all the existing effective and prospective records on a machine-readable tape or other mutually acceptable electronic medium accompanied by an affidavit attesting to the accuracy of such records; and
              (2) Simultaneously cancel such records from the paper tariff in the manner prescribed by subparts A through Q of part 221.
            
            
              § 221.500
              Transmission of electronic tariffs to subscribers.
              (a) Each filer that files an electronic tariff under this subpart shall make available to any person so requesting, a subscription service meeting the terms of paragraph (b) of this section.
              (b) Under the required subscription service, remote access shall be allowed to any subscriber to the on-line tariff database, including access to the justification required by § 221.205. The subscription service shall not preclude the offering of additional services by the filer or its agent.
              (c) The filer at its option may establish a charge for providing the required subscription service to subscribers: Provided that the charge may not exceed a reasonable estimate of the added cost of providing the service.

              (d) Each filer shall provide to any person upon request, a copy of the machine-readable data (raw tariff data) of all daily transactions made to its on-line tariff database. The terms and prices for such value-added service may be set by the filer: Provided that such terms and prices shall be non-discriminatory, i.e., that they shall be substantially equivalent for all similarly-situated persons.
            
            
              § 221.550
              Copies of tariffs made from filer's printer(s) located in Department's public reference room.
              Copies of information contained in a filer's on-line tariff database may be obtained by any user at Departmental Headquarters from the printer or printers placed in Tariff Public Reference Room by the filer. The filer may assess a fee for copying, provided it is reasonable and that no administrative burden is placed on the Department to require the collection of the fee or to provide any service in connection therewith.
            
            
              § 221.600
              Actions under assigned authority and petitions for review of staff action.
              (a) When an electronically filed record which has been submitted to the Department under this subpart, is disapproved (rejected), or a special tariff permission is approved or denied, under authority assigned by the Department of Transportation's Regulations, 14 CFR 385.13, such actions shall be understood to include the following provisions:

This action is taken under authority assigned by the Department of Transportation in its Organization Regulations, 14 CFR 385.13. Persons entitled to petition for review of this action pursuant to the Department's Regulations, 14 CFR 385.50, may file such petitions within seven days after the date of this action.

            § 222.1
            Applicability.

            This part applies to all air transportation of property that includes both air movement by a direct foreign air carrier and surface transportation to or from any point within the United States (hereafter referred to as “intermodal cargo services”).
          
          
            § 222.2
            Scope of permissible intermodal cargo services.
            (a) Under its foreign air carrier permit, a direct foreign air carrier may provide or control the surface portion of intermodal cargo services within a zone extending 35 miles from the boundary of the airport or city it is authorized to serve. A direct foreign air carrier shall not provide or control the surface portion of intermodal cargo services outside of this 35-mile zone unless authorized to do so by the Board in accordance with §§ 222.3, 222.4 and 222.5.
            (b) A direct foreign air carrier shall be considered to control the surface portion of intermodal cargo services if it has or publicly represents that it has any responsibility for or control over the movement of, or has any ownership, controlling or exclusive dealing relationship with, the carrier actually providing the surface transportation.
            (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section with respect to control by a direct foreign air carrier, any U.S. or foreign indirect air carrier, surface carrier or surface freight forwarder may provide the surface portion of intermodal cargo services without limitation as to geographic area within the United States.
            (d) The Board may withdraw the authority of an indirect foreign air carrier to provide the surface portion of intermodal cargo services, or the authority of a direct foreign air carrier to offer intermodal cargo services pursuant to joint fares with other carriers providing the surface transportation, at any time, with or without hearing, if the Board finds it in the public interest.
          
          
            § 222.3
            Application for Statement of Authorization.
            (a) Application for a Statement of Authorization shall be filed with the Board's Regulatory Affairs Division, Bureau of International Aviation, in duplicate, on CAB Form 222 (obtainable from the Civil Aeronautics Board, Publications Services Division, Washington, D.C. 20428), attached as Appendix A. In most cases the Board will act upon applications for Statements of Authorization within 60 days.
            (b) Persons objecting to an application for a Statement of Authorization shall file their objections with the Regulatory Affairs Division, Bureau of International Aviation, within 28 days of the filing date of the application. The Board will list the names and nationalities of all persons applying for Statements of Authorization in its Weekly Summary of Filings.
            (c) An application shall include a copy of any bilateral agreement, memorandum of consultations, or diplomatic note or letter, in support of the authority requested. Documents that appear in official U.S. publications may be incorporated by reference.

            § 222.4
            Procedure on receipt of application for Statement of Authorization.
            (a) After review of an application form filed under § 222.3, the Board will take one or more of the following actions:
            (1) Indicate by stamp on CAB Form 222 the effective date of the Statement of Authorization, and return to the carrier the duplicate copy of Form 222 as evidence of approval under this part;
            (2) Request additional information from the applicant;
            (3) Set the application for notice and hearing procedures;

            § 234.1
            Purpose.
            The purpose of this part is to set forth required data that certain air carriers must submit to the Department and to computer reservations system vendors in computerized form, except as otherwise provided, so that information on air carriers' quality of service can be made available to consumers of air transportation. This part also requires that service quality data be disclosed directly to consumers.
          
          
            § 234.2
            Definitions.
            For the purpose of this part:
            
              Cancelled flight means a flight operation that was not operated, but was listed in a carrier's computer reservation system within seven calendar days of the scheduled departure.
            
              Discontinued flight means a flight dropped from a carrier's computer reservation system more than seven calendar days before its scheduled departure.
            
              Diverted flight means a flight which is operated from the scheduled origin point to a point other than the scheduled destination point in the carrier's published schedule. For example, a carrier has a published schedule for a flight from A to B to C. If the carrier were to actually fly an A to C operation, the A to B segment is a diverted flight, and the B to C segment is a cancelled flight.
            
              Extra-section flight means a flight conducted as an integral part of scheduled passenger service, that has not been provided for in published schedules and is required for transportation of traffic that cannot be accommodated on the regularly scheduled flight.
            
              Flight means any nonstop scheduled passenger flight segment with a specific flight number scheduled to be operated pursuant to a published schedule within a specific origin-destination city pair, other than transborder or foreign air transportation. In the case of reporting to computer reservations system vendors, flight also means one-stop or multi-stop single plane scheduled operations that include any flight segments for which performance is reported pursuant to this part.
            
              Late or late flight means a flight that arrives at the gate 15 minutes or more after its published arrival time.
            
              Mishandled-baggage report means a report filed with a carrier by or on behalf of a passenger that claims loss, delay, damage or pilferage of baggage.
            
              Mishandled checked bag means a checked bag that is lost, delayed, damaged or pilfered, as reported to a carrier by or on behalf of a passenger.
            
              New flight means a flight added to a carrier's schedule to operate in a specific origin-destination city pair and not scheduled to depart within 30 minutes of any discontinued flight that was contained in the carrier's published schedules for the same city pair during the previous month.
            
              On-time means a flight that arrives less than 15 mintues after its published arrival time.
            
              On-time performance means the percentage of scheduled operations of a specific flight that an air carrier operates on-time during a month.
            
              On-time performance code means a single character determined in accordance with the provisions of this part that reflects the monthly on-time performance of certain nonstop flights and single plane one-stop or multi-stop flights, the schedule and availability of which are listed in a computer reservation system (CRS) regulated by 14 CFR part 255.
            
              Reportable flight. (1) Reportable flight for air transportation taking place before January 1, 2018 means any nonstop flight, including a mechanically delayed flight, to or from any airport within the contiguous 48 states that accounts for at least 1 percent of domestic scheduled-passenger enplanements in the previous calendar year, as reported to the Department pursuant to part 241 of this title. Qualifying airports will be specified periodically in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Office of Airline Information.

            (2) Reportable flight for air transportation taking place on or after January 1, 2018 means any domestic nonstop scheduled passenger flight, including a mechanically delayed flight, held out to the public under the reporting carrier's code, to or from any U.S. large, medium, small, or non-hub airport as defined in 49 U.S.C. 47102. Qualifying airports will be specified periodically in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Office of Airline Information.
            
              Reporting carrier. (1) Reporting carrier for air transportation taking place before January 1, 2018 means an air carrier certificated under 49 U.S.C. 41102 that accounted for at least 1 percent of domestic scheduled-passenger revenues in the most recently reported 12-month period as defined by the Department's Office of Airline Information, and as reported to the Department pursuant to part 241 of this title. Reporting carriers will be identified periodically in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Office of Airline Information.
            (2) Reporting carrier for air transportation taking place on or after January 1, 2018 means an air carrier certificated under 49 U.S.C. 41102 that accounted for at least 0.5 percent of domestic scheduled-passenger revenus in the most recently reported 12-month period as defined by the Department's Office of Airline Information, and as reported to the Department pursuant to part 241 of this chapter. Reporting carriers will be identified periodically in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Office of Airline Information.

            (h) Reporting carriers should use the following codes to identify causes for cancelled flights:
            
            
              Code
              A—Air Carrier
              B—Extreme Weather
              C—National Aviation System (NAS).
              D-Security
            
            
            (1) Air Carrier cancellations are due to circumstances that were within the control of the air carrier (e.g., lack of flight crew, maintenance, etc.).
            (2) Extreme weather cancellations are caused by weather conditions (e.g., significant meteorological conditions), actual or forecasted at the point of departure, en route, or point of arrival that, in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and/or in the judgment of the air carrier, prevents operation of that flight and/or prevents operations of subsequent flights due to the intended aircraft being out of position as a result of a prior cancellation or delay attributable to weather.
            (3) NAS cancellations are caused by circumstances within the National Aviation System. This term is used to refer to a broad set of conditions: weather-non-extreme, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, air traffic control, etc.
            (4) Security cancellations may be the result of malfunctioning screening or other security equipment or a breech of security that causes the evacuation of the airport or individual concourses, or the need to re-screen passengers.

            (i) Reporting carriers should use the following causes to identify the reasons for delayed flights:
            
            
              
              CAUSE
              Air Carrier
              Extreme weather
              NAS
              Security
              Late arriving aircraft
            
            
            (1) Air carrier delays are due to circumstances within the control of the air carrier.
            (2) Extreme weather delays are caused by weather conditions (e.g., significant meteorological conditions, actual or forecasted at the point of departure, en route, or point of arrival that, in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and/or in the judgment of the air carrier, prevents operation of that flight and/or prevents operations of subsequent flights due to the intended aircraft being out of position as a result of a prior cancellation or delay attributable to weather.
            (3) NAS delays are caused by circumstances within the National Aviation System. This term is used to refer to a broad set of conditions: weather-non-extreme, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, air traffic control, etc.
            (4) Security delays may be the result of malfunctioning screening or other security equipment or a breech of security that causes the evacuation of the airport or individual concourses or the need to re-screen passengers.
            (5) Late arriving aircraft delays are the result of a late incoming aircraft from the previous flight.
            (j) When reporting causal codes in paragraph (a) of this section, reporting carriers are required to code delays only when the arrival delay is 15 minutes or greater; and reporting carriers must report each causal component of the reportable delay when the causal component is 5 minutes or greater.
            (k) For air transportation taking place on or after January 1, 2018, each reporting carrier shall also file a separate BTS Form 234 “On-Time Flight Performance Report” with the Office of Airline Information on a monthly basis, setting forth the information for each of its reportable flights held out with only the reporting carrier's airline designator code on the reporting carrier's Web site, on the Web sites of major online travel agencies, or in other generally recognized sources of schedule information, and operated by any code-share partner that is a certificated air carrier or commuter air carrier. If the operating carrier of the flight is not a reporting carrier, the non-operating reporting carrier must file a BTS Form 234 “On-time Flight Performance Report” with the Office of Airline Information on a monthly basis, setting forth the information regarding those flights in a form and manner consistent with the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) through (j) of this section. If the operating carrier of the flight is a reporting carrier, the non-operating reporting carrier must file a simplified BTS Form 234 “On-Time Flight Performance Report” with the Office of Airline Information on a monthly basis, setting forth the information regarding those flights in a form and manner consistent with the requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(4) and paragraph (a)(10) of this section, and in accordance with the requirements set forth in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Office of Airline Information.

            § 234.7
            Voluntary reporting.
            (a) In addition to the data for each reportable flight required to be reported by this part, a reporting carrier may report to DOT for every other nonstop domestic flight that it schedules, the reportable flight data specified in this part.
            (b) Any air carrier that is not a reporting carrier may file the data specified in this part for every reportable flight that it schedules, or for every nonstop domestic flight that it schedules.
            (c) Voluntary reports containing information not required to be filed (1) must be submitted in the same form and manner, and at the same time, as reports containing data required to be filed, and (2) must be accompanied by a written statement describing in detail the information that is being voluntarily submitted. A carrier that files a voluntary report must continue to do so for a period of not less than 12 consecutive months.
          
          
            § 234.8
            Calculation of on-time performance codes.
            (a) Each reporting carrier shall calculate an on-time performance code in accordance with this section and as provided in more detail in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Director, Office of Airline Information. The calculations shall be performed for each reportable flight, except those scheduled to operate three times or less during a month. In addition, each reporting carrier shall assign an on-time performance code to each of its single plane one-stop or multi-stop flights, or portion thereof, that the carrier holds out to the public through a CRS, the last segment of which is a reportable flight.
            (b) The on-time performance code shall be calculated as follows:
            (1) Based on reportable flight data provided to the Department, calculate the percentage of on-time arrivals of each nonstop flight. Calculations shall not include discontinued or extra-section flights for which data are not reported to the Department.
            (2) Based upon the on-time performance percentage calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, assign a single digit code to each flight that reflects the percentile of on-time performance achieved by the flight, as set forth in the following table:

            (4) In the case of a new flight, carriers shall assign a performance code consisting of the letter “N.” A flight that is not a new flight shall be assigned the performance code calculated for the flight that it replaces, even if the two flights do not have the same flight number. In the case of a flight scheduled to operate three times or less during a month, carriers shall assign a performance code consisting of the letter “U.”
            (c) Carriers shall calculate on-time performance percentages and assign on-time performance codes on a monthly basis. This process shall be completed no later than the 15th day of each month, when the reports required by this part are due to the Department, and the codes shall reflect the previous month's operations.

            No later than the 15th day of each month, each reporting carrier shall deliver, or arrange to have delivered, to each system vendor, as defined in 14 CFR part 255, the on-time performance codes required to be determined above. Carriers may report the codes by insuring that they are included in basic schedule tapes provided to CRS vendors or by providing a separate tape that will permit the CRS vendors to match the performance codes with basic schedule tapes.
          
          
            § 234.10

            (a) Any air carrier may determine, in accordance with the provisions of § 234.8 of this part, the on-time performance codes for the flights for which it voluntarily provides flight information to the Department pursuant to § 234.7 of this part.
            (b) A carrier may supply these additional on-time performance codes to system vendors at the same time and in the same manner as the required disclosures are made to system vendors, provided that voluntary disclosures must continue for a period of not less than 12 consecutive months, and must be supplied either
            (1) For each of the carrier's reportable flights and each of its single plane one-stop or multi-stop flights, or portions thereof, that it holds out to the public through a CRS, the last segment of which is a reportable flight or
            (2) For each of the carrier's domestic flights.
          
          
            § 234.11
            Disclosure to consumers.
            (a) During the course of reservations or ticketing discussions or transactions, or inquiries about flights, between a carrier's employees or contractors and the public, the carrier shall disclose upon reasonable request the on-time performance code for any flight that has been assigned a code pursuant to this part.

            (b) For each domestic flight for which schedule information is available on its Web site, including domestic code-share flights, a reporting carrier shall display the following information regarding the flight's performance during the most recent calendar month for which the carrier has reported on-time performance data to the Department: the percentage of arrivals that were on time—i.e., within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival time, the percentage of arrivals that were more than 30 minutes late (including special highlighting if the flight was late more than 30 minutes of scheduled arrival time more than 50 percent of the time), and the percentage of flight cancellations if 5 percent or more of the flight's operations were canceled in the month covered. The information must be provided by showing all of the required information on the initial listing of flights or by showing all of the required information via a prominent hyperlink in close proximity to each flight on the page with the initial listing of flights.
            (c) The first time each carrier must load the information whose disclosure is required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section onto its Web site is on Saturday, July 24, 2010, for June data. Carriers must load all subsequent flight performance information on the fourth Saturday of the month following the month that is being reported.
            (d) A reporting carrier must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section by June 29, 2010.

            § 235.1
            Definitions.
            For the purposes of this part:
            
            
              Air transport includes the entire period during which an animal is in the custody of an air carrier, from the time that the animal is tendered to the air carrier prior to departure until the air carrier tenders the animal to the owner, guardian or representative of the shipper of the animal at the animal's final destination. It does not include animals that accompany a passenger at his or her seat in the cabin and of which the air carrier does not take custody.
            
              Animal means any warm- or cold-blooded animal which, at the time of transportation, is being kept as a pet in a family household in the United States and any dog or cat which, at the time of transportation, is shipped as part of a commercial shipment on a scheduled passenger flight, including shipments by trainers and breeders.
          
          
            § 235.2
            Applicability.
            This part applies to the scheduled domestic and international passenger service of any U.S. air carrier that operates such service with at least one aircraft having a designed seating capacity of more than 60 passenger seats. The reporting requirements of this part apply to all scheduled-service passenger flights of such carriers, including flights that are operated with aircraft having 60 or fewer seats.
          
          
            § 235.3
            Reports by air carriers on incidents involving animals during air transport.
            (a) Each covered carrier shall, within 15 days after the end of the month to which the information applies, submit to the United States Department of Transportation's Aviation Consumer Protection Division a report on any incidents involving the loss, injury, or death of an animal during air transport provided by the air carrier, including incidents on flights by that carrier that are operated with aircraft having 60 or fewer seats. The report shall be made in the form and manner set forth in reporting directives issued by the Deputy General Counsel for the U.S. Department of Transportation and shall contain the following information:
            (1) Carrier and flight number;
            (2) Date and time of the incident;
            (3) Description of the animal, including name, if known;
            (4) Name and contact information of the owner(s), guardian, and/or shipper of the animal;
            (5) Narrative description of the incident;
            (6) Narrative description of the cause of the incident;
            (7) Narrative description of any corrective action taken in response to the incident; and
            (8) Name, title, address, and telephone number of the individual filing the report on behalf of the air carrier.
            (b) Within 15 days after the end of December of each year, each covered carrier shall submit the following information (this information may be included in any report that the carrier may file for the loss, injury, or death of animals during the month of December):
            (1) The total number of incidents involving an animal during air transport provided by the air carrier for the entire calendar year, including incidents on flights by that carrier that are operated with aircraft having 60 or fewer seats. The report shall include subtotals for loss, injury, and death of animals. Report “0” for any category for which there were no such incidents. If the carrier had no reportable incidents for that calendar year, it shall report “0” in each category. Covered carriers shall use the following data table when reporting the total number of animal incidents during air transport provided by the air carrier for the entire calendar year:
            
              
                 
                Total number in the calendar year
              
              
                Deaths
              
              
                Injuries
              
              
                Loss
                
              
            
            (2) The total number of animals transported in the calendar year. If the carrier did not transport any animals for that calendar year, it shall report “0.”

            (3) The December report must contain the following certification signed by the carrier's authorized representative: “I, the undersigned, do certify that this report has been prepared under my direction in accordance with the regulations in 14 CFR part 235. I affirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this is a true, correct and complete report.”

              General Powers
              
                Sec. 204. (a) The Board is empowered to perform such acts, to conduct such investigations, to issue and amend such orders, and to make and amend such general or special rules, regulations, and procedure, pursuant to and consistent with the provisions of this Act, as it shall deem necessary to carry out the provisions of, and to exercise and perform its powers and duties under, this Act.
              filing of reports
              
                Sec. 407. (a) The Board is empowered to require annual, monthly, periodical, and special reports from any air carrier; to prescribe the manner and form in which such reports shall be made; and to require from any air carrier specific answers to all questions upon which the Board may deem information to be necessary. Such reports shall be under oath whenever the Board so requires. The Board may also require any air carrier to file with it a true copy of each or any contract, agreement, understanding, or arrangement, between such air carrier and any other carrier or person, in relation to any traffic affected by the provisions of this Act.
              Disclosure of Stock Ownership
              
                Sec. 407. (b) Each air carrier shall submit annually, and at such other times as the Board shall require, a list showing the names of each of its stockholders or members holding more than 5 per centum of the entire capital stock or capital, as the case may be, of such air carrier, together with the name of any person for whose account, if other than the holder, such stock is held; and a report setting forth a description of the shares of stock, or other interest, held by such air carrier, or for its account, in persons other than itself.
              Form of Accounts
              
                Sec. 407. (d) The Board shall prescribe the forms of any and all accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by air carriers, including the accounts, records, and memoranda of the movement of traffic, as well as of the receipts and expenditures of money, and the length of time such accounts, records, and memoranda shall be preserved; and it shall be unlawful for air carriers to keep any accounts, records, or memoranda other than those prescribed or approved by the Board: Provided, That any air carrier may keep additional accounts, records, or memoranda if they do not impair the integrity of the accounts, records, or memoranda prescribed or approved by the Board and do not constitute an undue financial burden on such air carrier.
              Inspection of Accounts and Property
              
                Sec. 407. (e) The Board shall at all times have access to all lands, buildings, and equipment of any carrier and to all accounts, records, and memoranda, including all documents, papers, and correspondence, now or hereafter existing, and kept or required to be kept by air carriers; and it may employ special agents or auditors, who shall have authority under the orders of the Board to inspect and examine any and all such lands, buildings, equipment, accounts, records, and memoranda. The provisions of this section shall apply, to the extent found by the Board to be reasonably necessary for the administration of this Act, to persons having control over any air carrier, or affiliated with any air carrier within the meaning of section 5(8) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended.
              Classification
              
                Sec. 416. (a) The Board may from time to time establish such just and reasonable classifications or groups of air carriers for the purposes of this title as the nature of the services performed by such air carriers shall require; and such just and reasonable rules and regulations, pursuant to and consistent with the provisions of this title, to be observed by each such class or group, as the Board finds necessary in the public interest.
              Safety, Economic and Postal Offenses
              
                Sec. 901. (a)(1) Any person who violates (A) any provision of Title III, IV, V, VI, VII, or XII of this Act, or any rule, regulation, or order issued thereunder, or under section 1002(i), or any term, condition or limitation of any permit or certificate issued under Title IV, or (B) any rule or regulation issued by the Postmaster General under this Act, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not to exceed $1,000 for each such violation. If such violation is a continuing one, each day of such violation shall constitute a separate offense: Provided, That this subsection shall not apply to members of the Armed Forces of the United States, or those civilian employees of the Department of Defense who are subject to the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, while engaged in the performance of their official duties; and the appropriate military authorities shall be responsible for taking any necessary disciplinary action with respect thereto and for making to the Administrator or Board, as appropriate, a timely report of any such action taken.

              (2) Any such civil penalty may be compromised by the Administrator in the case of violations of Titles III, V, VI, or XII, or any rule, regulation, or order issued thereunder, or by the Board in the case of violations of Titles IV or VII, or any rule, regulation or order issued thereunder, or under section 1002(i), or any term, condition, or limitation of any permit or certificate issued under Title IV, or by the Postmaster General in the case of regulations issued by him. The amount of such penalty, when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the person charged.
              Failure To File Reports; Falsification of Records
              
                Sec. 902. (e) Any air carrier, or any officer, agent, employee, or representative thereof, who shall, knowingly and willfully, fail or refuse to make a report to the Board or Administrator as required by this Act, or to keep or preserve accounts, records, and memoranda in the form and manner prescribed or approved by the Board or Administrator, or shall, knowingly and willfully, falsify, mutilate, or alter any such report, account, record, or memorandum, or shall knowingly and willfully file any false report, account, record, or memorandum, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, be subject for each offense to a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $5,000.
              Refusal To Testify
              
                Sec. 902. (g) Any person who shall neglect or refuse to attend and testify, or to answer any lawful inquiry, or to produce books, papers, or documents, if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpena or lawful requirement of the Board or Administrator, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $5,000, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
              Filing of Complaints Authorized
              
                Sec. 1002. (a) Any person may file with the Administrator or the Board, as to matters within their respective jurisdictions, a complaint in writing with respect to anything done or omitted to be done by any person in contravention of any provisions of this Act, or of any requirement established pursuant thereto. If the person complained against shall not satisfy the complaint and there shall appear to be any reasonable ground for investigating the complaint, it shall be the duty of the Administrator or the Board to investigate the matters complained of. Whenever the Administrator or the Board is of the opinion that any complaint does not state facts which warrant an investigation or action, such complaint may be dismissed without hearing. In the case of complaints against a member of the Armed Forces of the United States acting in the performance of his official duties, the Administrator or the Board, as the case may be, shall refer the complaint to the Secretary of the department concerned for action. The Secretary shall, within ninety days after receiving such a complaint, inform the Administrator or the Board of his disposition of the complaint, including a report as to any corrective or disciplinary actions taken.
              Investigations on Initiative of Administrator or Board
              
                Sec. 1002. (b) The Administrator or Board, with respect to matters within their respective jurisdictions, is empowered at any time to institute an investigation, on their own initiative, in any case and as to any matter or thing within their respective jurisdictions, concerning which complaint is authorized to be made to or before the Administrator or Board by any provision of this Act, or concerning which any question may arise under any of the provisions of this Act, or relating to the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Act. The Administrator or the Board shall have the same power to proceed with any investigation instituted on their own motion as though it had been appealed to by complaint.
              Entry or Orders for Compliance With Act
              
                Sec. 1002. (c) If the Administrator or the Board finds, after notice and hearing, in any investigation instituted upon complaint or upon their own initiative, with respect to matters within their jurisdiction, that any person has failed to comply with any provision of this Act or any requirement established pursuant thereto, the Administrator or the Board shall issue an appropriate order to compel such person to comply therewith.

            Air Carrier Groupings
            
              (a) All large certificated air carriers are placed into three basic air carrier groupings based upon their level of operations and the nature of these operations. In order to determine the level of operations, total operating revenues for a twelve-month period are used. The following operating revenue ranges are used to establish air carrier groupings:
              
                
                  Carrier Group
                  Total Annual Operating Revenues
                
                
                  I
                  0-$100,000,000
                
                
                  II
                  $100,000,001-$1,000,000,000
                
                
                  III
                  $1,000,000,001 + 
                
              
              For reporting purposes, Group I air carriers are further divided into two subgroups: (1) Air carriers with total annual operating revenues from $20,000,000 to $100,000,000 and (2) Air carriers with total annual operating revenues below $20,000,000.

              (b) Both the criteria for establishing air carrier groupings and the assignment of each air carrier to a specific group of carriers will be reviewed periodically by the Director, Office of Airline Information, to assure the maintenance of appropriate standards for the grouping of carriers. When an air carrier's level of operations passes the upper or lower limit of its currently assigned carrier grouping, the carrier is not automatically transferred to a different group and a new level of reporting. The Office of Airline Statistics will issue an updated listing of the carrier groups on an annual basis. A carrier may petition for reconsideration of its assigned carrier grouping or request a waiver from the accounting and reporting requirements that are applicable to a particular group under the provisions of section 1-2 of this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports.

              Applicability of system of accounts and reports.
              Each large certificated air carrier shall keep its books of account, records and memoranda and make reports to the BTS in accordance with this system of accounts and reports. The BTS reserves the right, however, under the provisions of sections 49 U.S.C. 41701 and 41708, to expand or otherwise modify the classes of carriers subject to this system of accounts and reports.

              Waivers from this system of accounts and reports.
              A waiver from any provision of this system of accounts or reports may be made by the BTS upon its own initiative or upon the submission of written request therefor from any air carrier, or group of air carriers, provided that such a waiver is in the public interest and each request for waiver expressly demonstrates that: existing peculiarities or unusual circumstances warrant a departure from a prescribed procedure or technique; a specifically defined alternative procedure or technique will result in a substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal of operating results or financial condition, consistent with the principles embodied in the provisions of this system of accounts and reports; and the application of such alternative procedure will maintain or improve uniformity in substantive results as between air carriers.

              Sec. 1-3
              General description of system of accounts and reports.
              (a) This system of accounts and reports is designed to permit limited contraction or expansion to reflect the varying needs and capacities of different air carriers without impairing basic accounting comparability as between air carriers. In its administration three air carrier groups, designated Group I, Group II, and Group III, respectively (see section 04), are established by the BTS. This grouping will be reviewed from time to time upon petition of individual air carriers or by initiative of the BTS with the view of a possible regrouping of the air carriers.
              (b) Under the system of accounts prescribed, balance sheet elements are accounted for by all air carrier groups within a fixed uniform pattern of specific accounts. All profit and loss elements are accounted for within specific objective accounts established for each air carrier group resulting from dual classifications, designated for each air carrier group, which are descriptive of both basic areas of financial activity, or functional operation, and objective served. The profit and loss elements of the three air carrier groups can be reduced to broad objectives and general or functional classifications which are comparable for all air carrier groups. Both balance sheet and profit and loss accounts and account groupings are designed, in general, to embrace all activities, both air transport and other than air transport, in which the air carrier engages and provide for the separation of elements identifiable exclusively with other than air transport activities. Profit and loss elements which are recorded during the current accounting year are subclassified as between (1) those which relate to the current accounting year and adjustments of a recurrent nature applicable to prior accounting years, and (2) extraordinary items of material magnitude.

              (c) In order to afford air carriers as much flexibility and freedom as possible in establishing ledger and subsidiary accounts to meet their individual needs, a minimum number of account subdivisions have been prescribed in this Uniform System of Accounts. It is intended, however, that each air carrier, in maintaining its accounting records, will provide subaccount and subsidiary account segregations of accounting elements which differ in nature of accounting characteristics, in a manner which will render individual elements readily discernible and traceable throughout the accounting system, and will provide for relating profit and loss elements to applicable balance sheet counterparts.

              Sec. 1-4
              System of accounts coding.
              (a) A four digit control number is assigned for each balance sheet and profit and loss account. Each balance sheet account is numbered sequentially, within blocks, designating basic balance sheet classifications. The first two digits of the four digit code assigned to each profit and loss account denote a detailed area of financial activity or functional operation. The first two digits, thus assigned to each profit and loss account, are numbered sequentially within blocks, designating more general classifications of financial activity and functional operation. The second two digits assigned to profit and loss accounts denote objective classifications.
              (b) A fifth digit, appended as a decimal, has been assigned for internal control by the BTS of prescribed subdivisions of the primary objective balance sheet and profit and loss classifications. A different fifth digit code number from that assigned by the BTS may be adopted for internal recordkeeping by the air carrier provided the prescribed subclassification of objective accounts is not impaired and the code number assigned by the BTS is employed in reporting to the BTS on Form 41 Reports.

              Sec. 1-5
              Records.
              (a) The general books of account and all books, records, and memoranda which support in any way the entries therein shall be kept in such manner as to provide at any time full information relating to any account. The entries in each account shall be supported by such detailed information as will render certain the identification of all facts essential to a verification of the nature and character of each entry and its proper classification under the prescribed Uniform System of Accounts. Registers, or other appropriate records, shall be maintained of the history and nature of each note receivable and each note payable.
              (b) The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records such as organization tables and charts, internal accounting manuals and revisions thereto, minute books, stock books, reports, cost distributions and other accounting work sheets, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which may constitute necessary links in developing the history of, or facts regarding, any accounting or financial transaction.
              (c) All books, records and memoranda shall be preserved and filed in such manner as to readily permit the audit and examination thereof by representatives of the DOT. All books, records, and memoranda shall be housed or stored in such manner as to afford protection from loss, theft, or damage by fire, flood or otherwise and no such books and records shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except in conformance with 14 CFR part 249 for the preservation of records.

              Sec. 1-6
              Accounting entities.
              (a) Separate accounting records shall be maintained for each air transport entity for which separate reports to the BTS are required to be made by sections 21(g) and for each separate corporate or organizational division of the air carrier. For purposes of this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports, each nontransport entity conducting an activity which is not related to the air carrier's transport activities and each transport-related activity or group of activities qualifying as a nontransport venture pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, whether or not formally organized within a distinct organizational unit, shall be treated as a separately operated organizational division; except that provisions of this paragraph and paragraph (b) shall not apply to leasing activities.

              (b) As a general rule, any activity or group of activities comprising a transport-related service provided for in transport-related revenue and expense accounts 09 through 18 shall be considered a separate nontransport venture under circumstances in which either: (1) A separate corporate or legal entity has been established to perform such services, (2) the aggregate annual revenue rate, as determined in section 2-1(d), during either of the prior two years exceeds the greater of $1 million per annum or one percent of the air carrier's total annual transport revenues, or (3) the aggregate annual expense rate, as determined in section 2-1(d), during either of the prior two years exceeds the greater of $1 million or one percent of the carrier's total annual operating expenses: Provided, That revenues and expenses from in-flight sales, and interchange sales shall be considered related to air transportation and accounted for accordingly, regardless of the revenue or expense standard set forth above.
              (c) The records for each required accounting entity shall be maintained with sufficient particularity to permit a determination that the requirements of section 2-1 have been complied with.

              Generally accepted accounting principles.
              (a) The accounting provisions contained in this part are based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Persons subject to this part are authorized to implement, as prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, newly issued GAAP pronouncements until and unless the Director, Office of Airline Information (OAI), issues an Accounting Directive making an initial determination that implementation of a new pronouncement would adversely affect the Department's programs.
              (b) The Director, OAI, shall review each newly issued GAAP pronouncement to determine its affect on the Department's regulatory programs. If adopting a specific change in GAAP would adversely affect the Department's programs, the Director will issue the results of the review in the form of an Accounting Directive. The directive will state the reasons why the particular change should not be incorporated in the uniform system of accounts and contain accounting guidance for maintaining the integrity of the Department's air carrier accounting provisions.
              (c) Objections and comments relating to the Department's decision not to implement a change in generally accepted principles may be addressed to Director, Office of Airline Information, K-25, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. If significant objections are raised urging adoption of a particular GAAP pronouncement, the Department will institute a rulemaking.

              (b) Each transaction shall be recorded and placed initially under accounting controls of the particular air transport entity or organizational division of the air carrier or member of an affiliated group to which directly traceable. If applicable to two or more accounting entities, a proration shall be made from the entity of original recording to other participating entities on such basis that the statements of financial condition and operating results of each entity are comparable to those of distinct legal entities. The allocations involved shall include all debits and credits associated with each entity.
              (c) For purposes of this section, investments by the air carrier in resources or facilities used in common by the regulated air carrier and those transport-related revenue services defined as separate nontransport ventures under section 1-6(b) shall not be allocated between such entities but shall be reflected in total in the appropriate accounts of the entity which predominately uses those investments. Where the entity of predominate use is a nontransport venture, the air carrier shall reflect the investment in account 1510.3, Advances to Associated Companies.
              (d) For purposes of this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports, all revenues shall be assigned to or apportioned between accounting entities on bases which will fully recognize the services provided by each entity, and expenses, or costs, shall be apportioned between accounting entities on such bases as will result: (1) With respect to transport-related services, in the assignment thereto of proportionate direct overheads, as well as direct labor and materials, of the applicable expense functions prescribed by this system of accounts and reports, and (2) with respect to separate ventures, in the assignment thereto of proportional general and administrative overheads as well as the direct overheads, labor, and materials.

              (c) Expense items contributing to more than one function shall be charged to the general overhead functions to which applicable except that where only incidental contribution is made to more than a single function an item may be included in the function to which primarily related, provided such function is not distorted by including an aggregation of amounts applicable to other functions. When assignment of expense items on the basis of the primary activity to which related does not in the aggregate result in a fair presentation of the expenses applicable to each function, apportionment shall be made between functions based upon a study of the contribution to each function during a representative period.

              Accounting period.
              (a) The accounting year of each air carrier subject to this Uniform System of Accounts shall be the calendar year unless otherwise approved by the BTS.
              (b) Each air carrier shall keep its financial accounts and records on a full accrual basis for each quarter so that all transactions, as nearly as may reasonably be ascertained, shall be fully reflected in the air carrier's books for the quarter in which revenues have been earned and the costs attaching to the revenues so earned in each quarter have been incurred independently of the incidence of sales or purchases and settlement with debtors or creditors.

              (c) Expenditures incurred during the current accounting year which demonstrably benefit operations to be performed during subsequent accounting years to a significant extent shall be deferred and amortized to the period in which the related operations are performed when of sufficient magnitude to distort the accounting results of the year in which incurred.
              (d) Expenditures charged directly or amortized to operations within one accounting year shall not be reversed in a subsequent accounting year and reamortized or charged directly against operations of subsequent years except that retroactive adjustments are permitted where necessary to conform with adjustments required by the DOT for ratemaking purposes.

              (5) A description of the sampling technique and conversion to totals, if sampling was employed.
              (6) The amount and basis for all estimates employed in the verification.
              (7) The amount of resulting adjustments and the quarter in which such adjustments were, or are to be, made in the accounts.
              (d) For those carriers who use the sales-lift match method to determine earned revenue, the analysis supporting the physical inventory verification shall include:
              (1) The cutoff date for the liability to be verified; such cutoff date shall be at the end of a calendar month.
              (2) A trial balance as of the cutoff date of all subaccounts supporting the Air Traffic Liability control account; the subsidiary trial balance must agree with the Air Traffic Liability control account or a reconciliation statement furnished.
              (3) A statement to the effect that a sales listing of the value of all unmatched auditor coupons has been compiled and compared to the general ledger control figure; the statement required by this subparagraph shall indicate whether or not the value of the unmatched coupons is in agreement with the general ledger. If the sales listing is not in agreement with the Air Traffic Liability control account, the amount of such difference shall be shown on such statement.

              Current Assets
              1010 Cash.
              (a) Record here all general and working funds available on demand as of the date of the balance sheet which are not formally restricted or earmarked for specific objectives. Funds deposited for special purposes which are to be satisfied within one year shall be included in account 1100 Short-term Investments and funds restricted as to general availability, which are not offset by current liabilities, shall be included in account 1550 Special Funds.
              (b) Each air carrier shall subdivide this account in such manner that the balance can be readily segregated as between balances in United States currency and the balances in each foreign currency.
              1100 Short-term Investments.
              (a) Record here the cost of short-term investments such as special deposits and United States Government securities, any other temporary cash investments, and the allowance for unrealized gain or loss on current marketable equity securities.
              (b) Special deposits for more than one year, not offset by current liabilities, shall not be included in this account but in account 1550 Special Funds.

              1200 Notes Receivable.
              (a) Record here current notes receivable including those from associated companies, company personnel, and all other sources.
              (b) Balances of notes payable to associated companies shall not be offset against amounts carried in this account. Balances with associated companies which are not normally settled currently shall not be included in this account but in balance sheet account 1510.3 Advances to Associated Companies.

              (a) Record here current accounts receivable including those due from the United States Government, foreign governments, associated companies, company personnel, and other amounts due for the performance of air transportation.

              (b) Amounts due from the United States Government shall be maintained in such fashion as will clearly and separately identify service mail pay receivables, subsidy receivables and other than mail transportation receivables.
              (c) Amounts due for the performance of air transportation shall include gross amounts due whether settled through airline clearing houses or with individual carriers. Amounts payable collected as agent shall not be credited to this account, but should be included in account 2190 Other Current Liabilities.
              (d) Balances payable to associated companies shall not be offset against amounts carried in this account. Balances with associated companies which are not normally settled currently shall not be included in this account but in balance sheet account 1510.3 Advances to Associated Companies.

              1290 Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.
              (a) Record here accruals for estimated losses from uncollectible accounts.
              (b) All accounts against which allowances have been established shall be examined quarterly for the purpose of redetermining the basis of accruals to be applied to subsequent accounting periods and the reasonableness of allowances already provided.
              1300 Spare parts and supplies.
              (a) Record here the cost of:
              (1) Flight equipment replacement parts of a type which ordinarily would be recurrently expended and replaced rather than repaired and reused;
              (2) Unissued fuel inventories for use in the overall or system operations of the carrier. Adjustments of inventories for aircraft fuel due to retroactive price increases and decreases shall not be entered in this account but in profit and loss account 45, Aircraft Fuels and Oils; and
              (3) Unissued and unapplied materials and supplies held in stock such as unissued shop materials, expendable tools, stationery and office supplies, passenger service supplies, and restaurant and food service supplies.
              (b) Costs paid by the air carrier such as transportation charges and customs duties; excise, sales, use and other taxes; special insurance; and other charges applicable to the cost of spare parts and supplies shall be charged to this account when they can be definitely allocated to specific items or units of property. If such costs cannot be so allocated, or if of minor significance in relation to the cost of such property, such amounts may be charged to balance sheet account 1890 Other Assets and Deferred Charges and cleared either by a suitable “loading charge” as the parts are used or by current charges to appropriate expense or property accounts; so long as the method of application does not cause material distortion in operating expenses from one accounting period to another.
              (c) Reusable spare parts and supplies recovered in connection with construction, maintenance, or retirement of property and equipment shall be included in this account at fair and reasonable values but in no case shall such values exceed original cost. Recoveries of normally reparable and reusable parts of a type for which losses in value may be covered on a practical basis through valuation allowance provisions shall be included in this account on an original cost basis. Scrap and nonusable parts, expensed from this account and recovered, shall be included at net amounts realizable therefrom with contra credit to the expense accounts initially charged.
              (d) The cost of rotable parts and assemblies of material value included in this account which ordinarily are repaired and reused and possess a service life approximating that of the primary property types to which related shall not be recorded in this account but in balance sheet account 1608 Flight Equipment Rotable Parts and Assemblies. For purposes of identifying rotable parts and assemblies of insignificant unit value which may be included in this account, a reasonable maximum unit value limitation may be established.

              (e) Any losses sustained or gains realized upon the abandonment or other disposition of flight equipment expendable parts shall be taken up as capital gains or losses in the periods in which sustained or realized. (See balance sheet account 1311.)
              
              (f) Items in this account shall be charged to appropriate expense accounts as issued for use. Profit and loss on sales of inventory items as a routine service to others shall be included in profit and loss accounts 14 General Service Sales—Associated Companies, or 16 General Service Sales—Outside, and the parts sold shall be removed from this accounts at full cost.
              (g) Materials and supplies held in small supply and purchased currently may be charged to appropriate expense accounts when purchased.
              (h) An allowance for inventory adjustment applicable to materials and supplies is prohibited. Items in this account shall be charged to appropriate expense accounts as issued for use.
              (i) Subaccounts shall be established within this account for the separate recording of each class or type of spare parts and supplies.

              (a) Accruals shall be made to this account when allowances are established for losses in the value of expendable parts. The accruals to this account shall be made by charges to profit and loss account 73 Provisions for Obsolescence and Deterioration—Expendable Parts. Records shall be maintained with sufficient detail to permit association of the allowances with each class or type of expendable parts.
              (b) The accruals to this account shall be based upon a predetermination by the air carrier of that portion of the total inventory of each class and type of expendable parts against which an allowance for loss is to be accrued. Expendable parts issued for use in operations shall be charged to operating expenses as issued and shall not be charged to this account. If at the end of any calendar year the amount of the allowance exceeds the product of the applicable inventory for the year determined consistently on a year-end or average basis, and the sum of the standard percentage accrual rates for all prior years including the current, the allowance shall be adjusted downward by the amount of the excess. Such adjustments shall be charged to this account and credited to profit and loss account 73 Provisions for Obsolescence and Deterioration—Expendable Parts.
              (c) Where changing conditions necessitate a revision or adjustment in rates of accrual, such revision or adjustment shall be made applicable to current and subsequent accounting periods and shall not be applied retroactively to prior accounting periods.

              General
              (a) The profit and loss accounts are designed to reflect, through natural groupings, the elements entering into the derivation of income or loss accruing to the proprietary interests during each accounting period.
              (b) The prescribed system of accounts provides for the co-ordinate grouping of all revenues and expenses in terms of both major natural objectives and functional activities and for subdivision of both to provide varying degrees of detail for air carriers of differing accounting capacities and/or requirements.

              (c) The detailed objective accounts established for each air carrier group, by the dual subdivision of profit and loss elements in terms of both natural objectives and functional activities, are set forth in section 7, Chart of Profit and Loss Accounts.
              (d) The prescribed system of accounts provides generally that profit and loss elements shall be grouped in accordance with their inherent characteristics within the following primary classifications:
              (1) Operating revenues. (i) This primary classification shall include revenues of a character usually and ordinarily derived from the performance of air transportation and air transportation-related services, which relate to services performed during the current accounting year, and adjustments of a recurrent nature applicable to services performed in prior accounting years.
              (ii) Operating revenues shall be subclassified in terms of functional activities as provided in section 9.
              (2) Operating expenses. (i) This primary classification shall include expenses of a character usually and ordinarily incurred in the performance of air transportation and air transportation-related services, which relate to services performed during the current accounting year, and adjustments of a recurring nature attributable to services performed in prior accounting years.
              (ii) Operating expenses shall be subclassified in terms of functional activities as provided in sections 10 and 11.
              (3) Nonoperating income and expense—net. This primary classification (8100) shall include income and loss incident to commercial ventures not inherently related to the performance of the common carrier air transport services of the accounting entity; other revenues and expenses attributable to financing or other activities which are extraneous to and not an integral part of air transportation or its incidental services; and special recurrent items of a nonperiod nature.
              (4) Income taxes for current period. This primary classification (9100) shall include provisions for Federal, state, local, and foreign taxes which are based upon the net income of the air carrier for the current period together with refunds for excess profits credits or carryback of losses and increases or reductions of income taxes of prior years of a magnitude which will not distort net income of the current accounting year. Income taxes applicable to special income credits or debits recorded in profit and loss classification 9700 Extraordinary Items, and other material income tax items not allocable to income of the current accounting year, shall not be included in this classification but in profit and loss classification 9700 Extraordinary Items.
              (5) Discontinued operations. This primary classification (9600) shall include earnings and losses of discontinued nontransport operations and gains or losses from the disposal of nontransport operations the result of which are customarily accounted for through profit and loss objective accounts 86, 87 and 88.2.
              (6) Extraordinary items. This primary classification (9700) shall include material items characterized by their unusual nature and infrequent occurrence.
              (7) Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. This primary classification (9800) shall include the cumulative effect of material changes in accounting principles.

              (b) This function shall include the cost of direct labor, materials, and outside services and maintenances overhead or other costs specifically associated with maintenance operations regardless of the location at which incurred.
              (c) This function shall not include costs incurred in the construction, improvement, or modification of property and equipment even when necessitated to meet new or changed operating or safety standards. Such costs shall be charged to appropriate property and equipment accounts.
              (d) Costs incurred by aircraft handling personnel in visual inspection, minor check and servicing of aircraft, while in line service, shall not be included in this function when performed as an incidental routine during the normal productive use of aircraft but shall be included in function 6900 General Services and Administration.
              (e) Each Group I air carrier shall maintain the following subfunctions:
              
                5200 Direct Maintenance.
                
                a. This subfunction shall include the costs of labor, materials and outside services consumed directly in periodic maintenance operations and the maintenance and repair of property and equipment, of all types and classes, regardless of the location at which incurred, exclusive of costs specifically identified with maintenance property and equipment expenses in balance sheet accounts 1630 Equipment, 1639 Improvements to Leased Buildings and Equipment, and 1640.1 Maintenance Buildings and Improvements which shall be included in subfunction 5300 Maintenance Burden.

                b. The cost of direct labor, materials and supplies, as well as outside repairs, used in the maintenance and repair of property and equipment shall be recorded on running job orders or tickets covering repairs and periodic inspections except servicing. Where a number of like items are maintained on a group basis, it will be necessary to maintain only one job order for each group.
                c. When supervisory personnel such as crew chiefs, inspectors and foremen are engaged in direct labor in connection with equipment maintenance, a proportionate part of their salaries and wages shall be charged to the appropriate direct labor accounts. The cost of transporting property to and from shops for repair and maintenance shall be included as a part of the cost of the materials and supplies used in the repair or maintenance of such property and equipment. Transportation charges, customs and duties, etc.; shall be included in the cost of repairs and maintenance operations when made by outside parties.
                5300 Maintenance Burden.
                
                a. This subfunction shall include all overhead or general expenses which are specifically identified with activities involved in periodic maintenance operations and the maintenance and repair of property and equipment of all types and classes, including the cost of direct labor, materials and outside services identified with the maintenance and repair of maintenance property and equipment included in balance sheet accounts 1630 Equipment, 1639 Improvements to Leased Buildings and Equipment, and 1604.1 Maintenance Buildings and Improvements. It shall include expenses specifically related to the administration of maintenance stocks and stores, the keeping of pertinent maintenance operations records, and the scheduling, controlling, planning and supervision of maintenance operations.

                c. This subfunction shall include only those expenses attributable to the current air transport operations of the air carrier. Maintenance burden associated with capital projects of the air carrier, other than overhauls of airframes and aircraft engines shall be allocated to such projects. Maintenance burden incurred in common with services to other companies and operating entities shall be allocated to such services on a pro rata basis unless the services are so infrequent in performance or small in volume as to result in no appreciable demands upon the air carrier's maintenance facilities. When overhauls of airframes or aircraft engines are as a consistent practice accounted for on an accrual basis instead of being expensed directly, maintenance burden shall be allocated to such overhauls on a pro rata basis. Standard burden rates may be employed for quarterly allocations of maintenance burden provided the rates are reviewed at the close of each calendar year. When the actual burden rate for the year differs materially from the standard burden rate applied, adjustment shall be made to reflect the actual cost incurred for the full accounting year. Allocations of maintenance burden to capital projects, and service sales to others shall be made through the individual maintenance burden objective accounts, except that the air carrier may make such allocations by credits to profit and loss account 77 Uncleared Expense Credits provided that use of that account will not undermine the significance of the individual maintenance burden objective accounts in terms of the expense levels associated with the air carrier's air transport services. Maintenance burden allocated to overhauls shall be credited to profit and loss subaccounts 5372.1 or 5372.6 Airworthiness Allowance Provisions.

              Objective Classification—Operating Revenues and Expenses
              00 General Instructions.
              (a) Basic objective accounts, applicable to all air carrier groups, are established for recording all revenue and expense elements. These basic accounts are in certain areas subdivided to provide greater detail for indicated air carrier groups.
              (b) Each air carrier shall credit the gross revenues accruing from services ordinarily associated with air transportation and transportation-related services to the appropriate account established for each revenue source. Expenses incident to transport and transport-related services shall be charged to the accounts established in this section in accordance with the objectives served by each expenditure. However, direct costs of forwarding traffic as a result of interrupted trips, and refunds of sales, shall be charged to the applicable revenue account.
              (c) To the end that the integrity of the prescribed objective accounts shall not be impaired, each air carrier shall:
              (1) Charge the appropriate account prescribed for each service purchased or expense element incurred expressly for the benefit of the air carrier regardless of whether incurred directly by the air carrier or through an agent or other intermediary, and (2) except as provided in objective account 77, Uncleared Expense Credits, credit or charge, as appropriate, the account prescribed for each expense element which may be involved in distributions of expenses between (i) separate operating entities of the air carrier, (ii) transport-related services and transport services, or transport functions, (iii) balance sheet and profit and loss elements, and (iv) the air carrier and others, when the expenses are incurred initially by or for the benefit of the air carrier. At the option of the air carrier, standard rates applicable to each objective account comprising a particular pool of expenses subject to assignment between two or more activities, may be established for proration purposes, provided the rates established are predicated upon the experience of the air carrier and are reviewed and modified as appropriate at least once each year.

              (a) Detailed domestic on-flight market data and nonstop segment data except military data shall be made publicly available after processing. Domestic data are defined as data from air transportation operations from a place in any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession to a place in any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession. Domestic military operations are reported under service codes N or R.
              (b) Detailed international on-flight market and nonstop segment data in Schedule T-100 and Schedule T-100(f) reports, except military data, shall be publicly available immediately following the Department's determination that the database is complete, but no earlier than six months after the date of the data. Military operations are reported under service codes N or R. Data for on-flight markets and nonstop segments involving no U.S. point shall not be made publicly available for three years. Industry and carrier summary data may be made public before the end of six months or the end of three years, as applicable, provided there are three or more carriers in the summary data disclosed. The Department may, at any time, publish international summary statistics without carrier detail. Further, the Department may release nonstop segment and on-flight market detail data by carrier before the end of the confidentiality period as follows:
              (1) To foreign governments as provided in reciprocal arrangements between the foreign country and U.S. Government for exchange of on-flight market and/or nonstop segment data submitted by air carriers of that foreign country and U.S. carriers serving that foreign country;
              (2) To parties to any proceeding before the Department under Title IV of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, as required by the Administrative Law Judge or other decisionmaker of the Department. Parties may designate agents or consultants to receive the data in their behalf, provided the agents or consultants agree to abide by the disclosure restrictions. Any data to which access is granted pursuant to this provision may be introduced into evidence, subject to the normal rules of admissibility of evidence.
              (3) To agencies and other components of the U.S. Government for their internal use only.

              Sec. 19-7
              Passenger origin-destination survey.

              (a) All U.S. large certificated air carriers conducting scheduled passenger operations (except helicopter carriers) shall participate in a Passenger Origin-Destination (O & D) Survey covering domestic and international operations, as described in the instructions manual entitled, Instructions to Air Carriers for Collecting and Reporting Passenger Origin-Destination Survey Statistics (Appendix A to this section), and in Passenger Origin-Destination Directives issued by the Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), Office of Airline Information (OAI). Copies of these Instructions and Directives are provided to each large carrier participating in the Survey. Copies are also available from the Office of Airline Information, K-25, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. Copies of these Instructions and Directives are available on the BTS Web page at (http://www.bts.gov/programs/airline_information/).
              (b) Reports required by this section shall be submitted to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in a format specified in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Director of Airline Information.

              (c) A statistically valid sample of light coupons shall be selected for reporting purposes. The sample shall consist of at least 1 percent of the total lifted ticket flight coupons for all large domestic markets listed in the Instructions and 10 percent for all others—including domestic and international markets. The sample shall be selected and reported in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of their section, except that the participating O & D carriers with nonstandard ticketing procedures, or other special operating characteristics, may propose alternative procedures. Such departures from standard O & D Survey practices shall not be authorized unless approved in writing by the Director, Office of Airline Information under the procedures in Sec. 1-2 of 14 CFR part 241. The data to be recorded and reported from selected lifted ticket flight coupons, as stipulated in the Instructions and Directives shall include the following data elements: Point of origin, carrier on each flight-coupon stage, fare-basis code for each flight-coupon stage, points of stopover or connection (interline and intraline), point of destination, number of passengers, and total dollar value of ticket (fare plus tax).
              (d) Data covering the operations of foreign air carriers that are similar to the information collected in the Passenger Origin-Destination Survey are generally not available to the Department, the U.S. carriers, or U.S. interests. Therefore, because of the damaging competitive impact on U.S. carriers and the adverse effect upon the public interest that would result from unilateral disclosure of the U.S. survey data, the Department has determined its policy to be that the international data in the Passenger Origin-Destination Survey shall be disclosed only as follows:
              (1) To an air carrier directly participating in and contributing input data to the Survey or to a legal or consulting firm designated by an air carrier to use on its behalf O & D data in connection with a specific assignment by such carrier.
              (2) To parties to any proceeding before the Department to the extent that such data are relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding upon a determination to this effect by the Administrative Law Judge or by the Department's decision-maker. Any data to which access is granted pursuant to this section may be introduced into evidence subject to the normal rules of admissability of evidence.
              (3) To agencies and other components of the U.S. Government.
              (4) To other persons upon a showing that the release of the data will serve specifically identified needs of U.S. users which are consistent with U.S. interests.
              (5) To foreign governments and foreign users as provided in formal reciprocal arrangements between the foreign and U.S. governments for the exchange of comparable O & D data.
              (e) The Department reserves the right to make such other disclosures of the O & D data as is consistent with its regulatory functions and responsibilities.

Foreign air carriers do not directly participate in the Survey, although some of their data are captured in the Survey, since passengers who share a ticketed itinerary between a U.S. carrier and a foreign carrier may be sampled by the U.S. carrier. The authority for these instructions is found in 14 CFR part 241, section 19-7, and in the CAB Sunset Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 94-443).
                The Survey samples revenue passenger trips moving in whole or in part on domestic and/or international scheduled services of the carriers participating in the Survey. In general, these requirements do not apply to small certificated, all-cargo and all charter carriers.
                The source documents for the Survey data are passenger tickets. These data are collected from the “lifted” flight coupons of tickets (a portion of a multi-part ticket booklet of three 1
                   or more coupons, including one for each stage of the passenger's trip itinerary which is lifted by the carrier as the passenger boards a particular flight segment).
                
                  

                    1 Each ticket booklet is comprised of one or more flight coupons for passenger travel in a city-pair market, plus a passenger coupon (the traveler's receipt) and the auditor coupon (for the carrier's internal controls).
                

                The Survey data are taken from the coupon that is lifted by a participating carrier, unless it is apparent from the lifted coupon that another participating carrier has already recorded and reported the data, in which instance the ticket coupon is non-reportable for the second honoring/participating carrier. The complete passenger itinerary, and related data on type of fare and dollar value of the ticket, is recorded as one entry from the sampled, reportable flight coupon.
                The recording of data from the sampled flight coupon normally consists of transcribing the information exactly as indicated on the ticket. The detail recorded for each trip shows the complete routing from the origin city (airport code) to the destination city (airport code) including, in sequence from the origin, each point of transfer and stopover (intraline and interline), the summarized fare-basis code shown for each flight coupon stage of the itinerary, and the total dollar value of the fare and tax for the entire ticket.
                Prior to 1987, the Survey was generally based on a 10-percent sample of passenger tickets. Beginning July 1, 1987, the Survey is collected primarily on the basis of a stratified, scientific sample of at least 1 percent of tickets in domestic major markets and 10 percent of tickets in all other domestic and in all international city-pair markets. The Survey data are taken from the selected flight coupons of the tickets sampled: single-coupon or double-coupon round trips in domestic major markets where the ticket serial number ends in double zero (00) and all other ticket coupons ending in zero (0). This procedure yields a “two-tiered” stratified sample.

                Group tickets are included on the basis of a 10-percent sample when the number of passengers on such a group ticket is 10 or less. Group tickets with more than 10 passengers on each ticket are included on the basis of a 100 percent census, i.e., all such tickets are sampled, regardless of serial number, and the total data listed are conformed to a 10 percent sample for inclusion in the O&D Survey.
                Following the selection of reportable flight coupons and the recording of data, each participating carrier shall edit and summarize 2
                   the data into a quarterly report to the Department.
                
                  
                    2 These summarization procedures include showing two or more passengers with the same itinerary as one O&D record and compressing extremely lengthy itineraries (such as around-the-world tickets) into a standard trip stage length limit (which may be either seven or twenty-three stages, at the carrier's option), as explained in Section V.D.
                
                II. Effective Date of Instructions
                These data collection and reporting instructions are effective on and after July 1, 1987 and apply to all flight coupons lifted on or after July 1, 1987.
                III. Carriers Participating in Survey
                A. Participating carriers. As defined in section 19-7 of the Department's Economic Regulations (14 CFR part 241), the participants in the O&D Survey include all large certificated air carriers conducting scheduled passenger services (except helicopter carriers). These participating carriers collect and report data in accordance with these Instructions, and supplemental Passenger Origin-Destination Directives that may be issued periodically. The list of participating carriers will be issued by reporting directive under the authority in 14 CFR 385.27(b).
                B. Amendments to list of participating carriers. As new carriers begin service, they will be required to file O&D Survey Data. These carriers will not be added to the participating carrier list automatically, but will be added when the next annual review is made.
                IV. Submission of Reports
                A. Period covered by reports. Reports are to be filed for each calendar quarter of the year as shown below:

                D. [Reserved]
                E. All reports shall be filed with the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in a format specified in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Director of Airline Information.
                V. Selection of Sample and Recording of Data. 4
                  
                
                
                  
                    4 Upon approval of the Director, Office of Airline Information, carriers may continue current reporting procedures (up to twenty-three stages of a passenger flight) and may report a uniform 10 percent sample of tickets lifted (each zero ending lifted coupon) without reducing the sample size from 10 percent to 1 percent for domestic major markets. Note that the domestic major markets will be reviewed each year at June 30, based on the prior 12 months O&D data, and the list amended as necessary. The list could remain static for more than a year, although it will be reviewed annually. Necessary amendments will be effective on January 1 of the following year.
                
                A. Sampling Basis. Each participating carrier in this O&D Survey shall search all listed flight coupons, whether the coupons are its own ticket stock or on the ticket stock of another U.S. or foreign carrier (either standard IATA and ARC ticket stock or nonstandard ticket stock), and is to select for reporting purposes the following flight coupons:
                (1) Major domestic markets. All single-passenger flight coupons that are either a single flight coupon ticket or part of a round trip, two coupon ticket where the ticket serial number ends in the digits double-zero (00).
                
                
                  Note.
                  The list of major domestic markets will be issued by reporting directive under the authority in 14 CFR 385.27(b).
                
                
                (2) International markets and all other domestic markets. (a) All single-passenger flight coupons with ticket serial numbers ending with the digit zero (0);
                (b) Those group-ticket flight coupons with 10 or fewer passengers with ticket serial numbers ending with the digit zero (0);
                (c) Those group-ticket flight coupons with 11 or more passengers without regard to serial number; and
                (d) Itineraries in major domestic markets that comprise more than two coupons are sampled on a uniform 10 percent basis, by selecting all ticket serial numbers ending with the digit zero (0).
                B. Selection of Reportable Flight Coupons. The flight coupons identified above are to be examined to isolate the reportable flight coupons, i.e. coupons from which data are to be recorded. Flight coupon data are reported only by the first honoring and participating carrier (operating carrier). Such carriers shall report the required data for the entire ticketed itinerary.
                If a participating carrier has preceded an examining carrier on any stage in the trip itinerary, including any stage in a conjunction itinerary and any stage in a reissued ticket (either before or after reissue) that coupon is not reportable.
                For conjunction tickets, the ticket number for the first ticket booklet determines if the conjunction tickets should be reported in the Survey. Otherwise, conjunction tickets do not require special treatment and are governed by the rules for regular tickets.
                No adjustment is made in the Survey for alterations or changes in the trip itinerary subsequent to the stage covered by the reportable coupon.
                C. Optional Use of Other Sampling Procedures.
                
                (1) Alternative sampling procedures or alternative O&D data systems may be proposed by participating carriers with nonstandard ticketing procedures, or other special operating characteristics. Data reported under proposed alternative procedures must approximate the usefulness and statistical validity of the O&D Survey.
                (2) Such departures from the prescribed O&D Survey practices shall not be authorized unless approved in writing by the Director, Office of Airline Information (address inside front cover). The proposed alternative O&D Survey procedures must be described in detail in the letter requesting the waiver.
                D. Recording of Data from Reportable Flight Coupons. (1) The following items are to be reported from the reportable flight coupons:
                (a) Point of origin,
                (b) Operating carrier on each flight stage (if unknown, identify ticketed carrier),
                (c) Ticketed carrier on each flight stage,
                (d) Fare-basis on each flight coupon, C, D, F, G, X or Y,
                (e) Points of stopover or connection (interline and intraline),
                (f) Point of destination,
                (g) Number of passengers, and
                (h) Total dollar value of ticket (fare plus tax and other charges, such as Passenger Facility Charges).
                (2) The individual items are to be recorded in the sequence of occurrence in the itinerary as follows:
                (a) All entries for points (airport codes 5

                  ) in an itinerary are to be recorded in three-letter airport code data to fit into the stage-length limitation (seven or twenty-three stages at the carrier's option), all airport codes are to be reported, including data on commuter, foreign, intra-state and other carriers' portions of itineraries. Normally codes are recorded as they appear on the ticket. However, if a code is obviously incorrect, record the correct code. For instance, if a ticket is coded DCA-NYC or Washington/National to New York when the flight stage actually operated from Washington, Dulles to Newark (EWR), record the correct airport code. When only name spellings of a city appear on the ticket for multi-airport cities (such as Washington, New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles), record the specific three letter airport code. In cases where two airport codes are shown on the ticket for a point, such as when the passenger arrives at an airport such as San Francisco and departs from another local airport such as Oakland, record the code for the arrival airport, enter a surface segment indicator (—) to the departure airport, and record the departure airport code. (When the surface portion is at the beginning or end of an itinerary, the surface indicator is to be omitted). For example:
                
                  

                    5 Codes to be used are those appearing in the Official Airline Guide at the time the data are being recorded. If a code is not found in the OAG, contact the Director, Office of Airline Information (address inside front cover).

                In the above example, the passenger trip stages or segments are compressed into the maximum of 7 stages so that several intermediate city-pairs (Los Angeles to Seattle to Anchorage, or LAX—SEA—Anc) and the related carriers have not been recorded, as prescribed below in this Section V.D.(3)(e). In addition, after the fourth city-pair (Los Angeles-Salt Lake City), the passenger trip itinerary moves from the initial four-part ticket booklet onto another “conjunction” ticket, and the summary fare code data are not recorded beyond the initial four-part ticket.
                (b) All entries for operating and ticketed carriers for a coupon stage of an itinerary are to be recorded using two character IATA-assigned or DOT codes, as in the above example. Note that the fare code summary was properly inserted after the ticketed carrier's code, i.e., UA for United Air Lines and Y for unrestricted coach class service. When a two-character carrier code is shown on the ticket, record that code for the ticketed carrier. However, if a code is obviously incorrect, record the correct carrier code. If the reporting carrier does not know the operating carrier on a downline code-share segment, it would use the ticketed carrier's code for both the operating and ticketed carriers. The reporting carrier is not responsible for knowing the operating carrier of a downline code-share where it is not a party to the code-share segment. Except for the infrequent compression of data to fit into the stage-length limitation (7 or 23 stages at the carrier's option), all carrier codes are to be recorded, including data on air taxis, commuters, intra-state, and other carrier portions of itineraries. On tickets involving interchange service or other cooperative carrier arrangements, the juncture point(s) where the passenger moves from one carrier system to another is to be recorded as an intermediate point in the itinerary, even when not shown on the ticket and even though the flight may overfly the juncture point.

                (c) Entries for fare-basis codes are to be taken from the “fare basis” and “fare description” portions of the ticket and simplified into the appropriate category, as shown below. No attempt shall be made to determine and record fare-basis codes for that portion of a conjunction ticket appearing in the ticket. Fare-basis codes are to be recorded in one-character alphabetic codes. The fare-basis codes are recorded as follows:
                
                C—Unrestricted Business Class
                D—Restricted Business Class
                F—Unrestricted First Class
                G—Restricted First Class
                X—Restricted Coach/Economy Class
                Y—Unrestricted Coach/Economy Class
                
                U—Unknown (This fare category is used when none is shown on a ticket coupon, or when a fare category is not discernible, or when two or more carrier fare codes are compressed into a single stage of a passenger trip).
                
                (d) In recording the number of passengers, each single-passenger ticket is to be recorded as one passenger. Tickets for infants under two years of age not occupying a seat are not to be counted. A revenue passenger is defined in Section X.

                For group tickets of 10 or fewer passengers per ticket record the actual number of passengers on each ticket, i.e., either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10. For group tickets with 11 or more passengers (those sampled at a 100-percent rate) record the actual number of passengers traveling on each ticket, but keep these entries separate from the group ticket records with 10 or fewer passengers and from the single-passenger ticket records. Group tickets with 11 or more passengers are to be sorted and summarized to combine all passengers for all itineraries which are identical in every respect, i.e., points, carriers, fare basis codes, and average dollar value (as defined in paragraph (e), below). The total number of passengers on each summarized record is to be divided by 10, rounding to the nearest whole passenger. If the quotient ends in 0.5 or more, raise to the next whole passenger. If the quotient ends in less than 0.5, drop the fraction. These large group-ticket records, after division by 10 for compatibility with the other data, are to be merged with the single-passenger records and with the group-ticket entries from tickets of 10 or fewer passengers for the quarterly O&D Survey report.
                (e) The total dollar value shall be taken from the “Total” box on each ticket and shall be the sum of the fare plus tax for the entire ticket. Record this amount in whole U.S. dollars, with the cents dropped. Do not round cents to nearest whole dollar.

                Amounts on tickets stated in foreign currency are to be converted to U.S. dollar equivalents. For all group tickets, the dollar value to be recorded shall be the average amount per passenger, determined by dividing the total dollar value for the entire group by the number of passengers on the group ticket, dropping cents in the average amount.
                (3) The length of the itineraries to be recorded is limited to a maximum of seven stages or twenty-three stages, at the carrier's option. This recognizes that the vast majority of tickets sampled have seven stages or fewer and that the rare occurrences of extremely lengthy itineraries do not impact the overall Survey results enough to justify their reporting burden. Therefore, trips longer than these limits are compressed to fall within the stated maximums. The ticketed origin and destination are retained, but the intermediate routing is compressed by applying the following rules, in sequence:
                (a) Combine any contiguous open, unknown carrier, or surface stages eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring the fare-basis codes, if different:
                (b) Combine any contiguous stages via the same non-U.S. carrier, eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring the fare-basis codes, if different;
                (c) Combine any contiguous stages via different non-U.S. carrier, making the carrier “UK”, eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring fare-basis codes, if different:
                (d) Combine any contiguous stages via the same U.S. carrier, eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring the fare-basis codes, if different, and;
                (e) If the trip, after applying the four steps above, is still too long, record the compressed routing through to the stage length limitation city (seventh or twenty-third city), enter UK as the final carrier, and then record the ticketed destination as the next (the 8th or 24th) city.
                VI. Summarization of Recorded Data
                A. General. Prior to the submission of each quarterly report to the Department, each carrier is to summarize the data in accordance with the rules in Section VI.B. In special hardship cases, carriers may submit a waiver request (with justification under Section 1-2 of 14 CFR part 241) requesting permission to report their flight coupon records exactly as represented on their lifted tickets. Waiver requests must provide the documentation described in Section VI.C. so that the Department can develop the necessary procedures and edit routines to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the overall O&D Survey results. The granting of such waivers will depend upon the availability of resources for the Department to assume this additional burden, which can only be determined on a case by case basis, after evaluating each carrier's need.
                B. Rules for Summarization. Sort the recorded entries into sequence by the entire record (excluding the passenger field) i.e., by origin, complete routing (including fare-basis codes), tickets destination, and dollar value of ticket. All identical records are then to be combined into one summary record. The number of passengers on the summary record is to be the sum of the passenger amounts of all the individual records combined. Passengers are only summarized where records are identical in all respects except in the number of passengers including dollar value of ticket. Note: Do not summarize dollars over identical records. This summarization is to include the entries from group tickets, but only after the entries for group tickets with 11 or more passengers have been summarized and divided by 10, as stated in Section V.D.(2)(d).
                C. Waiver Requests. Requests for permission to depart from the required O&D Survey procedures should include a procedural statement describing the process the carrier proposed to employ in examining, selecting and editing the data from reportable flight coupons for the O&D Survey, as well as a flow chart diagramming the proposed procedures.
                D. Quantity and Quality Controls. Carriers are expected to establish and maintain continuous quantity and quality controls on the flow of all lifted flight coupons through their system processes to determine the total number of coupons handled and the number of reportable coupons selected. Such data controls and tests have not been specified by the Department, and necessarily must be developed by each carrier. Each participating carrier shall develop and use on a continuous basis such control tests as are necessary to ensure that all reportable coupons are being selected, recorded and reported as intended by these O&D Survey Instructions. Such controls should extend over all ADP processing, both in-house and that from external service bureaus.
                VII. Editing of Recorded Data
                A. City and Airport Codes. Prior to submission of O&D Survey reports, each carrier is to edit the recorded data to validate city and airport codes. This edit is to verify that the codes recorded are valid official codes, and it is independent of whether or not the carriers shown actually operated into or out of the airport shown. Any questions about airport codes should be addressed to the Director, Office of Airline Information (see inside of cover).
                B. Edit Responsibility of Carriers. Each carrier is responsible for developing edit procedures and internal controls over its data entry and processing procedures so that valid and reliable data are captured in the O&D Survey inputs and are properly summarized in the outputs. Since the carriers have many different statistical systems, it is not practicable for the Department of Transportation to prescribe specific controls in this area, and each carrier is responsible for developing the appropriate internal control procedures to edit the O&D Survey data and ensure the integrity of these data. The Department will control the accuracy of its processing of the sampled data upon receipt from the carriers.
                C. System Documentation of Edits. Carriers are required to maintain written O&D Survey procedural statements and flow charts. As provided in Section VIII, these must be established, or re-certified as of July 1, 1987, and thereafter when significant procedural revisions occur.
                VIII. Control of Sample Selection and Data Recording
                A. Sample Accuracy and Reliability. In order to maximize the accuracy and reliability of the sample selection and data recording, each carrier is to:
                (1) Develop a written statement describing the procedures it will employ in examining and selecting reportable flight coupons and in recording, summarizing, editing, and testing the Survey data.
                (2) Submit any proposed changes in the above procedures to the Department's Office of Airline Information, prior to implementation of such changes.
                (3) Establish continuous quantity controls on the flow of all lifted flight coupons through the carrier's accounting processing to determine the total number of coupons handled, and the number of reportable coupons selected. Tests are to be made continuously to assure that all reportable coupons are being selected and the data recorded. Such tests should be completed while the “lifted” flight coupons (representing earned passenger revenues for flight segments operated) remain in the possession of the carrier. Establish such other internal control procedures as are necessary for supervising and monitoring the accuracy of the recording of data from reportable flight coupons.
                B. Staff Review. The OAI staff will review the carrier procedures and practices and may request modifications or the use of special procedures necessary to improve the sample or to bolster the controls for accuracy and reliability.

            General Reporting Provisions—Large Certificated Air Carriers
            
              Section 21
              Introduction to System of Reports
              (a) Each large certificated air carrier subject to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, shall file with the BTS, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, and annually BTS Form 41 Reports of financial and operating statistics as prescribed herein unless waiver has been made by the Civil Aeronautics Board.

              (b) The system prescribed provides for the submission by each air carrier of four classes of financial and operating statistics, on individual schedules of the BTS Form 41 Report, grouped as follows:
              
              
                A. Certification.
                B. Balance Sheet Elements.
                P. Profit and Loss Elements.
                T. Traffic and Capacity Elements.
              
              
              (c) The prescribed system of reports provides that the frequency of reporting shall be monthly for some schedules, quarterly for some, semiannually for some and annually for others. It also provides in some areas for the classification of large certificated air carriers into Group I, Group II, and Group III with the form and content differentiated as between groups.
              (d) Each schedule of the prescribed BTS Form 41 Report has been assigned a specific code. The prefix alphabetical codes A, B, P and T, respectively, have been employed to denote certification, balance sheet, profit and loss, and traffic and capacity. The digits immediately following the alphabetical prefix designate the particular schedule.
              (e) [Reserved]
              (f) [Reserved]
              (g) Four separate air carrier entities shall be established for large certificated air carriers conducting scheduled service for the purpose of submitting the prescribed reports. They are as follows: (1) Domestic operations; (2) operations via the Atlantic Ocean; (3) operations via the Pacific Ocean; and (4) operations in Latin American areas. With respect to the first classification, the domestic entity shall embrace all operations within and between the 50 States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and shall also include Canadian transborder operations. The reports to be submitted by each entity shall be comparable to those required of a distinct legal entity whether the reporting entity constitutes such an entity, a semiautonomous physically separated operating division of the carrier, or an entity established for reporting purposes only.
              (h) Two separate entities shall be established for large certificated air carriers predominantly engaged in conducting charter activities for the purpose of submitting the prescribed reports: (1) Domestic operations; and (2) international operations. The domestic entity includes all operations within and between the 50 States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All other operations will be in the international entity.
              (i) The entities for which separate reports shall be made by the different route and charter air carriers will be set semiannually by the Office of Airline Information.
              (j) As a general rule separate reports shall be filed for the air carrier and for each associated company air carriers as defined in section 03 which is an air carrier. However, transactions of associated companies in which 100 percent equity control resides in the reporting air carrier shall be consolidated with transactions of the reporting air carrier when such associated companies perform services related to the transport operations of the reporting air carrier almost exclusively and are not engaged in air transportation for their own account.

              (k) Generally, route air carriers' nonscheduled services shall be treated as an integral part of the reporting entity to which most closely related without regard to the geographic area in which such nonscheduled services may actually be performed. However, supplemental reports shall be made of nonscheduled services (including service for the Department of Defense) in areas not encompassed by the prescribed reporting entity in any month in which the available ton-miles of such nonscheduled services exceed 5 percent of the available ton-miles of the reporting entity. Such supplemental reports shall continue until waived by the BTS upon a showing that such nonscheduled operations will not in the subsequent 12-month period exceed the 5-percent limit. The supplemental reports to be filed each month or calendar quarter, as applicable, shall be comprised of report Schedules P-5, T-1, and T-2. Transport and nontransport revenues pertaining to such separately reported nonscheduled services shall be reported on Schedule P-2 each quarter.
              (l) When and as required in the national interest, any air carrier which performs nonscheduled transport services for the Department of Defense shall, when directed by the Department, make separate reports for such services as if they were conducted by a physically separate transport entity, such reports shall consist of Schedules P-1 through P-7, T-1, and T-2. The letter “D” shall be inserted on such reports, following the schedule number of each P and T schedule. When a carrier has more than one reporting entity, nonscheduled transport and nonscheduled Defense services shall be assigned to the reporting entity to which more closely related.

                  2 Reporting due dates on Form 41 Schedules B and P are extended to March 30 if preliminary schedules are filed at the Department by February 10
              
              (b) Each large certificated air carrier shall file the applicable schedules of the BTS Form 41 Report with the BTS in accordance with the above instructions with the following exceptions:
              (1) The time for filing B and P report schedules for the final quarter or semiannual period of each calendar year may be extended to the following March 30 if the preliminary Schedules B-1 or B-1.1 and P-1.1 or P-1.2 are submitted, as applicable, and are received on or before their respective due dates.
              (2) For the third month of any calendar quarter, Schedule P-1(a) need not be filed if Schedule P-1.1 or P-1.2 for the quarter or semiannual period, as applicable, is received on the due date prescribed for Schedule P-1(a).
              (3) Income and expense data on Schedule P-1(a) for each month will be withheld by the BTS from public disclosure, until such time as (i) the semiannual or quarterly financial reports are due, (ii) the semiannual or quarterly financial reports are filed, or (iii) information covered by monthly reports is publicly released by the carrier concerned, whichever occurs first. Before that time, income and expense data reported on Schedule P-1(a) will be disclosed to parties to any proceeding before the DOT to the extent that such data are relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding upon a determination to this effect by the administrative law judge assigned to the case or by the DOT. Any data to which access is granted may be introduced into evidence, subject to the normal rules of admissibility of evidence. The DOT will make other disclosure of these data upon its own motion or upon application of any interested person, when the DOT finds the public interest so requires. The BTS may, from time to time, publish summary information compiled from Schedule P-1(a) in a form which will not identify the individual carrier. At the request of an air carrier, and upon a showing by such air carriers that public disclosure of its preliminary year-end report would adversely affect its interests and would not be in the public interest, the BTS will withhold such preliminary year-end report from public disclosure until such time as (i) the final report is filed, (ii) the final report is due, or (iii) information covered by the preliminary report is publicly released by the carrier concerned, whichever occurs first.

              (c) If circumstances prevent the filing of a report on or before the prescribed due date, consideration will be given to the granting of an extension upon receipt of a written request therefor. To provide ample time for consideration and communication to the air carrier of the action taken, such a request must be delivered to the Board in writing at least three (3) days in advance of the due date, setting forth good and sufficient reason to justify the granting of the extension and the date when the report can be filed. Except in cases of emergency, no such request will be entertained which is not in writing and received by the BTS at least three (3) days before the prescribed due date. If a request is denied, the air carrier remains subject to the filing requirements to the same extent as if no request for extension of time had been made.
              (d) [Reserved]
              (e) All financial data reported on B, P and G schedules shall reflect the status of the air carrier's books of account for the period for which the report is being made and shall conform to the instructions contained in this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports. At the option of the air carrier, Group III air carriers may round reported financial data to the nearest thousands of dollars by typing “($000)” at the top of each amount column. All Group I and Group II air carriers may, at their option, round reported financial data to the nearest whole dollars by dropping the cents. All rounded amounts must be balanced within and between schedules. This option applies only to the submission of hardcopy reports. Instructions for the submission of data in ADP format are contained in the Accounting and Reporting Directives, which are available from OAI.
              (f) Traffic and other operational statistics included in schedules of the BTS Form 41 reports shall reflect data pertaining to the month, quarter or 12-months-to-date period for which the report is being made.
              (g) Adjustments correcting errors in previously reported traffic and other operational statistics shall not be included in data reported in schedules for the current period but shall be effected by submission of corrected schedules for the period to which applicable or, if only a few items are involved, by written notice and authorization to the BTS to correct previously filed reports except that any correction which amounts to less than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the corrected amount for the month to which related may be included in the report for the current month provided the amount of the correction is clearly noted on the Form 41 Report.
              (h) All letters and statements of correction or revision of reported data shall be a part of the BTS Form 41 reports.
              (i) All changes in accounting methods having a material impact upon the particular financial elements involved, and all changes in methods of computing and reporting traffic and capacity statistics having a material impact upon the particular statistic involved shall be adequately explained and identified in the report first reflecting such changes. Such explanations related to financial position or financial results shall be made on BTS Form 41 Schedule P-2. Changes in methods for computing or reporting traffic and capacity statistics shall be identified and explained on a separate sheet attached to the first report affected. (See sec. 2-16.) The reporting requirements shall not be construed, in any sense, as relieving the air carrier of the responsibility for conforming its procedures to those otherwise prescribed in this system of accounts and reports.
              (j) All financial statements released by carriers to the public reflecting a financial position or operating results for dates or reporting periods not covered by reports on file with the Board shall be filed with the Board simultaneously with their public release.

                Schedule A—Certification

                (a) The certification of the BTS Form 41 Report shall be signed by an elective corporate officer, executive, or director. Other persons may be authorized by the carrier to sign the certification provided a written authorization disclosing the individual's name and title is forwarded to the Department of Transportation. Since corrections or revisions of reported data are a part of the BTS Form 41 Report, all correspondence relating to such matters shall be signed only by the person(s) authorized to sign the certification.
                (b) The certification of the Form 41 reports, embodied in Schedule A thereof, shall read as follows:
                I, the undersigned (Title of officer in charge of accounts) ____ of the (Full name of the reporting company) ___ do certify that this report and all schedules, ADP-media submissions, Passenger Origin-Destination Survey submissions and supporting documents which are submitted herewith or have been submitted heretofore as parts of this report filed for the above indicated period have been prepared under my direction; that I have carefully examined them and declare that they correctly reflect the accounts and records of the company, and to the best of my knowledge and belief are a complete and accurate statement, after adjustments to reflect full accruals, of the operating revenues and expenses, income items, assets, liabilities, capital, retained earnings, and operating statistics for the periods reported in the several schedules, the Schedule T-100 ADP-media submissions, and the Passenger Origin-Destination Survey; that the various items herein reported were determined in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts and Reports for Large Certificated Air Carriers prescribed by the Department of Transportation; and that the data contained herein are reported on a basis consistent with that of the preceding report except as specifically noted in the financial and statistical statements.
                Schedule B-1 Balance Sheet

                (a) This Schedule shall be filed quarterly by all Group II and Group III air carriers and Group I air carriers that have annual operating revenues of $20 million or more.
                (b) This schedule shall be filed for the overall or system operations of the air carrier.
                (c) The statement of cash flows shall separately disclose the amount of net cash provided or used during the reporting period from the carrier's operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. The effect on cash and cash equivalents of the total amount of net cash provided or used during the quarter from each of the above activities shall be clearly disclosed so as to reconcile beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents.
                (d) Carriers may use either the direct or indirect method of reporting cash flows. Under either method, the reporting of cash flows from investing and financing activities will remain the same. However, the reporting of cash flows from operating activities does differ between the two methods.
                (e) For carriers electing to use the direct method, cash flows from operating activities are reported as gross amounts of the principal components of cash receipts and cash payments from operating activities, such as cash received from passengers and shippers, cash paid to suppliers, and cash paid to employees. Each carrier using the direct method shall provide as part of its statement of cash flows, a separate schedule that reconciles net income (as reported on Schedule P-1.2 in Account 9899) to cash flow from operating activities.
                (f) For carriers electing to use the indirect method, cash flows from operating activities shall reflect net income (as reported on Schedule P-1.2 in Account 9899) along with the adjustments necessary to reconcile net income (Account 9899) to net cash for the period (Net Cash Provided or Used By Operating Activities).
                (g) Regardless of the method used, the statement of cash flows shall reflect the amount of net cash flow provided or used by operating activities during the reporting period.

                (h) Each air carrier shall maintain records for each station showing the computation of fuel inventories and consumption for each fuel type. The periodic average cost method shall be used in computing fuel inventories and consumption. Under this method, an average unit cost for each fuel type shall be computed by dividing the total cost of fuel available (Beginning Inventory plus Purchases) by the total gallons available. The resulting unit cost shall then be used to determine the ending inventory and the total consumption costs to be reported on this schedule.
                (i) Where amounts reported for a specific entity include other than Jet A fuel, a footnote shall be added indicating the number of gallons and applicable costs of such other fuel included in amounts reported for that entity.
                (j) Where any adjustment(s) recorded on the books of the carrier results in a material distortion of the current month's schedule, carriers shall file a revised schedule P-12(a) for the month(s) affected.
                (k) Data reported on this schedule shall be withheld from public release until the quarterly Form 41 P schedules for the calendar quarter to which the monthly schedules relate are due at the BTS. However, aggregate data may be released before that time without identifying individual carriers. Provisions governing the due dates for submitting the quarterly P schedules are contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 22 of this part. Individual carrier fuel data withheld from public disclosure may be disclosed by the BTS to:

              Full name means the given name, middle initial or middle name, if any, and family name or surname as provided by the passenger.
            
              Passenger means every person aboard a covered flight segment regardless of whether he or she paid for the transportation, had a reservation, or occupied a seat, except the crew. For the purposes of this part, passenger includes, but is not limited to, a revenue and non-revenue passenger, a person holding a confirmed reservation, a standby or walkup, a person rerouted from another flight or airline, an infant held upon a person's lap and a person occupying a jump seat. Airline personnel who are on board but not working on that particular flight segment would be considered passengers for the purpose of this part.
            
              United States means the States comprising the United States of America, the District of Columbia, and the territories and possessions of the United States, including the territorial sea and the overlying airspace.
            
              U.S. citizen means United States nationals as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(22).

            § 244.1
            Definitions.
            
              Arrival time is the instant when the pilot sets the aircraft parking brake after arriving at the airport gate or passenger unloading area. If the parking brake is not set, record the time for the opening of the passenger door. Also, for purposes of section 244.3 carriers using a Docking Guidance System (DGS) may record the official “gate-arrival time” when the aircraft is stopped at the appropriate parking mark.
            
              Cancelled flight means a flight operation that was not operated, but was listed in an air carrier or a foreign air carrier's computer reservation system within seven calendar days of the scheduled departure.
            
              Certificated air carrier means a U.S. carrier holding a certificate issued under 49 U.S.C. 41102 to conduct passenger service or holding an exemption to conduct passenger operations under 49 U.S.C. 40109.
            
              Commuter air carrier means a U.S. carrier that has been found fit under 49 U.S.C. 41738 and is authorized to carry passengers on at least five round trips per week on at least one route between two or more points according to a published flight schedule using small aircraft as defined in 14 CFR 298.2.
            
              Covered carrier means a certificated carrier, a commuter carrier, or a foreign air carrier operating to, from, or within the United States, conducting scheduled passenger service or public charter service with at least one aircraft having a designed passenger seating capacity of 30 or more seats.
            
              Diverted flight means a flight which is operated from the scheduled origin point to a point other than the scheduled destination point in the carrier's published schedule. For example, a carrier has a published schedule for a flight from A to B to C. If the carrier were to actually fly an A to C operation, the A to B segment is a diverted flight, and the B to C segment is a cancelled flight. The same would apply if the flight were to operate from A to an airport other than B or C.
            
              Foreign air carrier means a carrier that is not a citizen of the United States as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a) that holds a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. 41302 or an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 40109 authorizing direct foreign air transportation.
            
              Gate departure time is the instant when the pilot releases the aircraft parking brake after passengers have boarded and aircraft doors have closed. In cases where the flight returned to the departure gate before wheels-off time and departs a second time, the reportable gate departure time for purposes of this part is the last gate departure time before wheels-off time. In cases of a return to the gate after wheels-off time, the reportable gate departure time is the last gate departure time before the gate return. If passengers were boarded without the parking brake being set, the reportable gate departure time is the time that the last passenger door was closed. Also, the official “gate-departure time” may be based on aircraft movement for carriers using a Docking Guidance System (DGS). For example, one DGS records gate departure time when the aircraft moves more than 1 meter from the appropriate parking mark within 15 seconds. Fifteen seconds is then subtracted from the recorded time to obtain the appropriate “out” time.
            
              Gate Return time means the time that an aircraft that has left the boarding gate returns to a gate or other position at an airport for the purpose of allowing passengers the opportunity to disembark from the aircraft.
            
              Large hub airport means an airport that accounts for at least 1.00 percent of the total enplanements in the United States.
            
              Medium hub airport means an airport accounting for at least 0.25 percent but less than 1.00 percent of the total enplanements in the United States.
            
              Non-hub airport means an airport with 10,000 or more annual enplanements but less than 0.05 percent of the total enplanements in the United States.
            
              Small hub airport means an airport accounting for at least 0.05 percent but less than 0.25 percent of the total enplanements in the United States.
            
              Tarmac delay means the holding of an aircraft on the ground either before taking off or after landing with no opportunity for its passengers to deplane.
          
          
            § 244.2
            Applicability.
            (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this part applies to U.S. certificated air carriers, U.S. commuter air carriers and foreign air carriers that operate passenger service to or from a U.S. airport with at least one aircraft that has an original manufacturer's design capacity of 30 or more seats. Covered carriers must report all passenger operations that experience a tarmac time of more than 3 hours at a U.S. airport.
            (b) For foreign air carriers that operate charter flights from foreign airports to U.S. airports, and return to foreign airports, and do not pick up any new passengers in the U.S., the charter flights are not flights subject to the reporting requirements of this part.
            (c) U.S. carriers that submit Part 234 Airline Service Quality Performance Reports must submit 3-hour tarmac delay information for public charter flights and international passenger flights to or from any U.S. large hub airport, medium hub airport, small hub airport and non-hub airport. These carriers are already required to submit such information for domestic scheduled flights to or from U.S. large hub airports under art 234 of this chapter. These carriers that are covered by part 234 need only submit information for flights with tarmac delays of more than 3 hours under this part 244 for domestic scheduled passenger flights to or from any U.S. medium hub airport, small hub airport and non-hub airport to the extent they do not report such information under 14 CFR 234.7.

                Pending case means any case that the DOT is empowered to hear before its final adjudication.
              
                Records include all documents that are related to, or constitute integral links in developing the history of, or facts regarding, financial transactions or physical operations of a particular segment, operating division, or entire system of the carrier's operations. The term includes any copy of initially prepared documents which bear approvals, comments, or notations which were added and are of significance to a full explanation of recorded facts or information.

              § 249.3
              Preservation of records.
              (a) All records listed in §§ 249.20 and 249.21 may be preserved on either paper or nonerasable microfilm (see § 249.4). However, a paper or microfilm record need not be created to satisfy the requirements of this part if the record is initially prepared in a machine-readable medium such as punched cards, magnetic tapes, and disks. The records maintained in machine-readable media and the underlying data used in their preparation shall be preserved for the periods prescribed in §§ 249.20 and 249.21. A paper or microfilm record shall not be destroyed after transfer to a machine-readable medium before expiration of the prescribed period: however, a waiver permitting the early destruction of paper or microfilm records transferred to a machine-readable medium may be granted by the Director, Office of Airline Information, when it is demonstrated by the requesting carrier that the substantive purpose of the retention requirement will be met by retention of the information in machine-readable form (see § 249.10).
              (b) Each record kept in a machine-readable medium shall be accompanied by a statement clearly indicating the type of data included in the record and certifying that the information contained in it is complete and accurate. This statement shall be executed by a person having personal knowledge of the facts contained in the records. The records shall be indexed and retained in such a manner so that they are easily accessible, and the carrier shall have the facilities available to locate, identify and reproduce the records in readable form without loss of clarity. Authorized representatives of the DOT shall be given immediate access to the carrier's facilities upon request.

              (c) If any record which must be retained under the provisions of §§ 249.20 and 249.21 is included as an exhibit to another document which must also be retained, the carrier need only keep in its files one copy of the record to satisfy these record retention requirements. In these cases, the carrier shall establish adequate cross-references to assist in locating the record.
              (d) The provisions in this part do not excuse noncompliance with requirements of any other governmental body, Federal or State, prescribing longer retention periods for any rec­ords.
              [ER-1214, 46 FR 25415, May 6, 1981, as amended at 60 FR 66725, Dec. 26, 1995]
            
            
              § 249.4
              Photographic copies.
              (a) Any record may be transferred to nonerasable microfilm (including microfiche, computer output microfilm, and aperture cards) at any time. Records so maintained on microfilm shall satisfy the minimum requirements listed in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
              (b) The microfilm shall be of a quality that can be easily read and that can be reproduced in paper similar in size to an original without loss of clarity or detail during the periods the records are required to be retained in §§ 249.20 and 249.21.
              (c) Microfilm records shall be indexed and retained in such a manner as will render them readily accessible, and the company shall have facilities available to locate, identify and read the microfilm and reproduce in paper form. Authorized representatives of the DOT shall be given immediate access to these facilities upon request.
              (d) Any significant characteristic, feature, or other attribute which microfilm will not preserve shall be clearly indicated at the beginning of each roll of film or series of microfilm records if applicable to all records on the roll or series, or on the individual record, as appropriate.
              (e) The printed side of printed forms need not be microfilmed for each record if nothing has been added to the printed matter common to all such forms, but an identified specimen of the form shall be on the film for reference.
              (f) Each roll of film or series of microfilm records shall include a microfilm of a certificate stating that the photographs are direct and facsimile reproductions of the original records and they have been made in accordance with prescribed regulations. Such a certificate shall be executed by a person having personal knowledge of these facts. Where the microfilm is computer output, the microfilm certificate shall state that the information is complete and accurate.

              § 249.6
              Destruction of records.
              (a) Upon the expiration of the period of preservation prescribed in this regulation, records may be destroyed at the option of the carrier.
              (b) Unless otherwise specified, duplicate copies of records may be destroyed at any time if they contain no significant information not shown on the originals.
            
            
              § 249.7
              Restrictions on record destruction.
              (a) Each carrier that has been named a party to a pending mail rate case shall retain all records remaining in its custody as of the beginning of an “open mail rate period” until the occurrence of one of the following contingencies, whichever is first:
              (1) Final adjudication of a DOT order fixing the final mail compensation payable for services rendered during an “open mail rate period.”

              (2) Receipt of a notice issued by the Director, Office of Airline Information in response to a written application filed by the carrier, authorizing the destruction of specifically identified categories of records. An application should be filed when the carrier believes that certain categories of records are not relevant to the proper processing of a pending mail proceeding. The application should list those categories of records which the carrier wants to destroy and its reasons for believing that the records are not necessary or useful in determining its satutory mail pay.
              
              (b) Each carrier shall preserve records supporting the computation of subsidy mail pay in accordance with the provisions of § 249.20 unless the carrier has been advised that these computations are subject to further review and disposition by the Board. When the DOT is still reviewing the compensation amount after expiration of the normal retention period specified in § 249.20, these records must be retained until the carrier is notified by the Director, Office of Airline Information, that the records may be destroyed.
              (c) Each carrier that has been named a party to an enforcement proceeding or against whom a third-party complaint has been filed shall retain all records relating to the case until the receipt of formal notification from the Director, Office of Airline Information, following a written application from the carrier, which authorizes the destruction of these records.
              (d) Each carrier that has been named a party to a pending case which is not of a type discussed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, shall preserve all records according to the provisions of § 249.20 unless the Director, Office of Airline Information, notifies the carrier in writing that specific records shall be preserved until final adjudication of the pending case.
              (e) Each carrier that is a party to litigation in a Federal court of which the DOT is also a party shall retain all records relating to the case until the receipt of formal notification from the Director, Office of Airline Information, following a written application from the carrier, which authorizes the destruction of these records.

              § 249.8
              Premature loss or destruction of records.
              If records are destroyed or lost before the expiration of the prescribed retention period, a statement shall be prepared and submitted to the Director, Office of Airline Information, which lists, as accurately as possible, the unavailable records and describes the circumstances under which they became unavailable.

              § 249.9
              Carriers going out of business.
              The records referred to in these regulations may be destroyed after the business is discontinued and the carrier is completely liquidated. The records may not be destroyed until dissolution is final and all transactions and litigations are completed. When a carrier is merged with another company which is regulated by the DOT, the successor company shall preserve records of the merged company in accordance with these regulations.

              § 249.10
              Waiver of requirements.
              A waiver from any provision of this regulation may be made by the Director, Office of Airline Information, upon the Director's own initiative or upon submission of a written request by a carrier or group of carriers. Each request for waiver shall demonstrate that unusual circumstances warrant a departure from prescribed retention periods, procedures, or techniques, or that compliance with the prescribed requirements would impose an unreasonable burden on the carrier, and that granting the waiver would be in the public interest.

            § 250.1
            Definitions.
            
              Airport means the airport at which the direct or connecting flight, on which the passenger holds confirmed reserved space, is planned to arrive or some other airport serving the same metropolitan area, provided that transportation to the other airport is accepted (i.e., used) by the passenger.
            
              Alternate transportation means air transportation with a confirmed reservation at no additional charge, operated by a carrier as defined below, or other transportation accepted and used by the passenger in the case of denied boarding.
            
              Carrier means: (1) a direct air carrier, except a helicopter operator, holding a certificate issued by the Department of Transportation pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 41102 or that has been found fit to conduct commuter operations under 49 U.S.C. 41738, or an exemption from 49 U.S.C. 41102, authorizing the scheduled transportation of persons; or (2) a foreign air carrier holding a permit issued by the Department pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 41302, or an exemption from that provision, authorizing the scheduled foreign air transportation of persons.
            
              Class of service means seating in the same cabin class such as First, Business, or Economy class, or in the same seating zone if the carrier has more than one seating product in the same cabin such as Economy and Premium Economy class.
            
              Confirmed reserved space means space on a specific date and on a specific flight and class of service of a carrier which has been requested by a passenger, including a passenger with a “zero fare ticket,” and which the carrier or its agent has verified, by appropriate notation on the ticket or in any other manner provided therefore by the carrier, as being reserved for the accommodation of the passenger.
            
              Fare means the price paid for air transportation including all mandatory taxes and fees. It does not include ancillary fees for optional services.

            Applicability.

            § 250.2a
            Policy regarding denied boarding.
            In the event of an oversold flight, every carrier shall ensure that the smallest practicable number of persons holding confirmed reserved space on that flight are denied boarding involuntarily.
          
          
            § 250.2b
            Carriers to request volunteers for denied boarding.

            (a) In the event of an oversold flight, every carrier shall request volunteers for denied boarding before using any other boarding priority. A “volunteer” is a person who responds to the carrier's request for volunteers and who willingly accepts the carriers' offer of compensation, in any amount, in exchange for relinquishing the confirmed reserved space. Any other passenger denied boarding is considered for purposes of this part to have been denied boarding involuntarily, even if that passenger accepts the denied boarding compensation.
            (b) Every carrier shall advise each passenger solicited to volunteer for denied boarding, no later than the time the carrier solicits that passenger to volunteer, whether he or she is in danger of being involuntarily denied boarding and, if so, the compensation the carrier is obligated to pay if the passenger is involuntarily denied boarding. If an insufficient number of volunteers come forward, the carrier may deny boarding to other passengers in accordance with its boarding priority rules.
            (c) If a carrier offers free or reduced rate air transportation as compensation to volunteers, the carrier must disclose all material restrictions, including but not limited to administrative fees, advance purchase or capacity restrictions, and blackout dates applicable to the offer before the passenger decides whether to give up his or her confirmed reserved space on the flight in exchange for the free or reduced rate transportation. If the free or reduced rate air transportation is offered orally to potential volunteers, the carrier shall also orally provide a brief description of the material restrictions on that transportation at the same time that the offer is made.

            § 250.3
            Boarding priority rules.
            (a) Every carrier shall establish priority rules and criteria for determining which passengers holding confirmed reserved space shall be denied boarding on an oversold flight in the event that an insufficient number of volunteers come forward. Such rules and criteria shall reflect the obligations of the carrier set forth in §§ 250.2a and 250.2b to minimize involuntary denied boarding and to request volunteers, and shall be written in such manner as to be understandable and meaningful to the average passenger. Such rules and criteria shall not make, give, or cause any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or subject any particular person to any unjust or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.
            (b) Boarding priority factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:
            (1) A passenger's time of check-in;
            (2) Whether a passenger has a seat assignment before reaching the departure gate for carriers that assign seats;
            (3) The fare paid by a passenger;
            (4) A passenger's frequent-flyer status; and
            (5) A passenger's disability or status as an unaccompanied minor.

            § 250.5
            Amount of denied boarding compensation for passengers denied boarding involuntarily.
            (a) Subject to the exceptions provided in § 250.6, a carrier to whom this part applies as described in § 250.2 shall pay compensation in interstate air transportation to passengers who are denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight as follows:
            (1) No compensation is required if the carrier offers alternate transportation that, at the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's first stopover, or if none, the airport of the passenger's final destination not later than one hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight;
            (2) Compensation shall be 200% of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, with a maximum of $675, if the carrier offers alternate transportation that, at the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's first stopover, or if none, the airport of the passenger's final destination more than one hour but less than two hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight; and

            (3) Compensation shall be 400% of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, with a maximum of $1,350, if the carrier does not offer alternate transportation that, at the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's first stopover, or if none, the airport of the passenger's final destination less than two hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight.
            (b) Subject to the exceptions provided in § 250.6, a carrier to whom this part applies as described in § 250.2 shall pay compensation to passengers in foreign air transportation who are denied boarding involuntarily at a U.S. airport from an oversold flight as follows:
            (1) No compensation is required if the carrier offers alternate transportation that, at the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's first stopover, or if not, the airport of the passenger's final destination not later than one hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight;
            (2) Compensation shall be 200% of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, with a maximum of $675, if the carrier offers alternate transportation that, at the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's first stopover, or if not, the airport of the passenger's final destination more than one hour but less than four hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight; and
            (3) Compensation shall be 400% of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, with a maximum of $1,350, if the carrier does not offer alternate transportation that, at the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's first stopover, or if not, the airport of the passenger's final destination less than four hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight.
            (c) Carriers may offer free or reduced rate air transportation in lieu of the cash or check due under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if—
            (1) The value of the transportation benefit offered, excluding any fees or other mandatory charges applicable for using the free or reduced rate air transportation, is equal to or greater than the cash/check payment otherwise required;
            (2) The carrier fully informs the passenger of the amount of cash/check compensation that would otherwise be due and that the passenger may decline the transportation benefit and receive the cash/check payment; and
            (3) The carrier fully discloses all material restrictions, including but not limited to, administrative fees, advance purchase or capacity restrictions, and blackout dates applicable to the offer, on the use of such free or reduced rate transportation before the passenger decides to give up the cash/check payment in exchange for such transportation. (See also § 250.9(c)).
            (d) The requirements of this section apply to passengers with “zero fare tickets.” The fare paid by these passengers for purposes of calculating denied boarding compensation shall be the lowest cash, check, or credit card payment charged for a ticket in the same class of service on that flight.
            (e) The Department of Transportation will review the maximum denied boarding compensation amounts prescribed in this part every two years except for the first review, which will take place in 2012 in order to put the reviews specified in this section on the same cycle as the reviews of domestic baggage liability limits specified in 14 CFR 254.6. The Department will use any increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as of July of each review year to calculate the increased maximum compensation amounts. The Department will use the following formula:

            (1) Current Denied Boarding Compensation limit in section 250.5(a)(2) multiplied by (a/b) rounded to the nearest $25 where:
            
            
              a = July CPI-U of year of current adjustment
              b = the CPI-U figure in August, 2011 when the inflation adjustment provision was added to Part 250.
            
            
            (2) The Denied Boarding Compensation limit in § 250.5(a)(3) shall be twice the revised limit for § 250.5(a)(2).

            (3) The Denied Boarding Compensation limit in paragraph (b)(2) shall be the same as the revised limit for paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and the Denied Boarding Compensation limit in paragraph (b)(3) shall be twice the revised limit for paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
            (f) In addition to the denied boarding compensation specified in this part, a carrier shall refund all unused ancillary fees for optional services paid by a passenger who is voluntarily or involuntarily denied boarding. The carrier is not required to refund the ancillary fees for services that are provided with respect to the passenger's alternate transportation.

            (a) The passenger does not comply fully with the carrier's contract of carriage or tariff provisions regarding ticketing, reconfirmation, check-in, and acceptability for transportation;
            (b) The flight for which the passenger holds confirmed reserved space is unable to accommodate that passenger because of substitution of equipment of lesser capacity when required by operational or safety reasons; or, on an aircraft with a designed passenger capacity of 60 or fewer seats, the flight for which the passenger holds confirmed reserved space is unable to accommodate that passenger due to weight/balance restrictions when required by operational or safety reasons;
            (c) The passenger is offered accommodations or is seated in a section of the aircraft other than that specified on the ticket at no extra charge, except that a passenger seated in a section for which a lower fare is charged shall be entitled to an appropriate refund; or
            (d) The carrier arranges comparable air transportation, or other transportation used by the passenger at no extra cost to the passenger, that at the time such arrangements are made is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's next stopover or, if none, at the airport of the final destination not later than 1 hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight or flights.

            (b) Where a carrier arranges, for the passenger's convenience, alternate means of transportation that departs before the payment can be prepared and given to the passenger, tender shall be made by mail or other means within 24 hours after the time the denied boarding occurs.

              Volunteers and Boarding Priorities
              If a flight is oversold (more passengers hold confirmed reservations than there are seats available), no one may be denied boarding against his or her will until airline personnel first ask for volunteers who will give up their reservation willingly, in exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, other passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily in accordance with the following boarding priority of (name of air carrier): (In this space the carrier inserts its boarding priority rules or a summary thereof, in a manner to be understandable to the average passenger.)
              Compensation for Involuntary Denied Boarding
              If you are denied boarding involuntarily, you are entitled to a payment of “denied boarding compensation” from the airline unless:
              (1) you have not fully complied with the airline's ticketing, check-in and reconfirmation requirements, or you are not acceptable for transportation under the airline's usual rules and practices; or
              (2) you are denied boarding because the flight is canceled; or
              (3) you are denied boarding because a smaller capacity aircraft was substituted for safety or operational reasons; or
              (4) on a flight operated with an aircraft having 60 or fewer seats, you are denied boarding due to safety-related weight/balance restrictions that limit payload; or
              (5) you are offered accommodations in a section of the aircraft other than specified in your ticket, at no extra charge (a passenger seated in a section for which a lower fare is charged must be given an appropriate refund); or
              (6) the airline is able to place you on another flight or flights that are planned to reach your next stopover or final destination within one hour of the planned arrival time of your original flight.

              International Transportation
              Passengers traveling from the United States to a foreign point who are denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight originating at a U.S. airport are entitled to: (1) No compensation if the carrier offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger's destination or first stopover not later than one hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight; (2) 200% of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, with a maximum of $675, if the carrier offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger's destination or first stopover more than one hour but less than four hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight; and (3) 400% of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, with a maximum of $1,350, if the carrier does not offer alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's destination or first stopover less than four hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight.

              Alternate Transportation

              “Alternate transportation” is air transportation with a confirmed reservation at no additional charge (by any scheduled airline licensed by DOT), or other transportation accepted and used by the passenger in the case of denied boarding.
              
              Method of Payment
              Except as provided below, the airline must give each passenger who qualifies for involuntary denied boarding compensation a payment by cash or check for the amount specified above, on the day and at the place the involuntary denied boarding occurs. If the airline arranges alternate transportation for the passenger's convenience that departs before the payment can be made, the payment shall be sent to the passenger within 24 hours. The air carrier may offer free or discounted transportation in place of the cash payment. In that event, the carrier must disclose all material restrictions on the use of the free or discounted transportation before the passenger decides whether to accept the transportation in lieu of a cash or check payment. The passenger may insist on the cash/check payment or refuse all compensation and bring private legal action.
              Passenger's Options
              Acceptance of the compensation may relieve (name of air carrier) from any further liability to the passenger caused by its failure to honor the confirmed reservation. However, the passenger may decline the payment and seek to recover damages in a court of law or in some other manner.
            
            
            (c) In addition to furnishing passengers with the carrier's written statement as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the carrier orally advises involuntarily bumped passengers that they are entitled to receive free or discounted transportation as denied boarding compensation, the carrier must also orally advise the passengers of any material restrictions or conditions applicable to the free or discounted transportation and that they are entitled to choose a check instead (or cash if that option is offered by the carrier).

            § 250.11
            Public disclosure of deliberate overbooking and boarding procedures.
            (a) Every carrier shall cause to be displayed continuously in a conspicuous public place at each desk, station and position in the United States which is in the charge of a person employed exclusively by it, or by it jointly with another person, or by any agent employed by such air carrier or foreign air carrier to sell tickets to passengers, a sign located so as to be clearly visible and clearly readable to the traveling public, which shall have printed thereon the following statement in boldface type at least one-fourth of an inch high:
            
              Notice—Overbooking of Flights

              Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few exceptions, including failure to comply with the carrier's check-in deadline (carrier shall insert either “of _ minutes prior to each flight segment” or “(which are available upon request from the air carrier)” here), persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations. Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be available. Check with your airline or your travel agent.
            
            
            (b) Every carrier shall include with each ticket sold in the United States the notices set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, printed in at least 12-point type. The notice may be printed on a separate piece of paper, on the ticket stock, or on the ticket envelope. The last two sentences of the notice shall be printed in a type face contrasting with that of the rest of the notice.
            (c) It shall be the responsibility of each carrier to ensure that travel agents authorized to sell air transportation for that carrier comply with the notice provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
            (d) [Reserved]
            (e) Any air carrier or foreign air carrier engaged in foreign air transportation that complies fully with this part for inbound traffic to the United States need not use the last two sentences of the notices required by paragraph (a) of this subsection.

            (a) A ticket or other written instrument that embodies the contract of carriage may incorporate contract terms by reference (i.e., without stating their full text), and if it does so shall contain or be accompanied by notice to the passenger as required by this part. In addition to other remedies at law, an air carrier may not claim the benefit as against the passenger of, and the passenger shall not be bound by, any contract term incorporated by reference if notice of the term has not been provided to that passenger in accordance with this part.

            Notice of incorporated terms.
            Except as provided in § 253.8, each air carrier shall include on or with a ticket, or other written instrument given to a passenger, that embodies the contract of carriage and incorporates terms by reference in that contract, a conspicuous notice that:

            § 253.7
            Direct notice of certain terms.
            A carrier may not impose any terms restricting refunds of the ticket price, imposing monetary penalties on passengers, or raising the ticket price consistent with § 399.87 of the chapter, unless the passenger receives conspicuous written notice of the salient features of those terms on or with the ticket.

            § 253.8
            Qualifications to notice requirements.
            (a) If notice is not provided in accordance with § 253.5 at a ticket sales location outside of the United States that is not a U.S. air carrier ticket office, the price paid for the portion of such ticket that is for interstate and overseas air transportation shall be refundable without penalty if the passenger refuses transportation by the carrier. Each air carrier shall ensure that passengers who have bought tickets at those locations without the notice required in § 253.5 are given that notice not later than check-in for the travel in interstate or overseas air transportation, and that conspicuous notice is included on or with the ticket stating that the price for that travel is refundable without penalty.
            (b) An air taxi operator (including a commuter air carrier) not operating under subpart I of part 298 of this chapter shall not be considered to have incorporated terms by reference into its contract of carriage merely because a passenger has purchased a flight segment on that carrier that appears on ticket stock that contains a statement that terms have been incorporated by reference. However, such an air taxi operator may not claim the benefit as against the passenger of, and the passenger shall not be bound by, any contract term incorporated by reference if notice of the term has not been provided to the passenger in accordance with this part.

            § 256.1
            Purpose.
            (a) The purpose of this part is to set forth requirements for the display of flight options by electronic airline information systems that provide air carrier or foreign air carrier schedule, fare, or availability information, including, but not limited to, global distribution systems (GDSs), corporate booking tools, and internet flight search tools, for use by consumers, carriers, ticket agents, and other business entities so as to prevent unfair or deceptive practices in the distribution and sale of air transportation.
            (b) Nothing in this part exempts any person from the operation of the antitrust laws set forth in subsection (a) of the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12).
          
          
            § 256.2
            Applicability.

            (a) This part applies to any air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent that operates an electronic airline information system, e.g., GDS, corporate booking tool, or internet flight search tool, that combines the schedules, fares or availability information of more than one air carrier or foreign air carrier for the distribution or sale in the United States of interstate or foreign air transportation.
            (b) This part applies only if the electronic airline information system is displayed on a Web site marketed to consumers in the United States or on a proprietary display available to travel agents, business entities, or a limited segment of consumers of air transportation in the United States.
          
          
            § 256.3
            Definitions.
            For purposes of this part:
            
              Availability means information provided in displays with respect to the ability to make a reservation on a particular flight.
            
              Display means the presentation of air carrier or foreign air carrier schedules, fares, or availability to a consumer or agent or other individual involved in arranging air travel for a consumer by means of a computer or mobile electronic device.
            
              Electronic airline information system or EAIS means a system that combines air carrier or foreign air carrier schedule, fare, or availability information for transmission or display to air carriers or foreign air carriers, ticket agents, other business entities, or consumers.
            
              Integrated display means any display that includes the schedules, fares or availability of more than one listed carrier.
          
          
            § 256.4
            Prohibition on undisclosed display bias.
            Each air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent that operates an EAIS must comply with the requirements of this section.
            (a) Each EAIS that uses any factor, not based on user selection or corporate contract travel arrangement, directly or indirectly relating to carrier identity in ordering the information contained in an integrated display must clearly disclose as provided for in § 256.5 that the identity of the carrier is a factor in the order in which information is displayed.
            (b) An EAIS's integrated display must not give any carrier's flights a system-imposed preference over any other carrier's flights in that market based on carrier identity unless the preference is prominently disclosed as provided for in § 256.5.

            (c) Each EAIS must display information in an objective manner based on search criteria selected by the user (e.g., lowest fare, lowest total cost, date and time of travel, class of service, stopovers, total elapsed time or duration of travel, number of stops, limitations on carriers to be used, particular airport(s), number of passengers, etc.) When providing information in response to a search by a user of the EAIS, the EAIS must order the information provided so that the flight options that best satisfy the parameters of the user-selected search criteria are displayed conspicuously and no less prominently (e.g., in the same or larger font size and the same or more noticeable font color) than any other flight option displayed. Flight options may be presented in sequence, matrix, or other formats, but the flight options that best satisfy the parameters of the user-selected search criteria must be ranked in lists above other flight options, or identified more prominently than other flight options in a matrix or other format. This does not preclude systems from setting default display parameters that are not deceptive or offering users the option to choose a variety of display methods within those parameters.
          
          
            § 256.5
            Minimum disclosure requirements for biased displays.
            To the extent an EAIS engages in display bias based on carrier identity, it must clearly and conspicuously disclose that fact at the top of each search result display presented to the user in response to the user-selected search criteria. The notice must state that the flights are not displayed in neutral order and that certain airlines' fare, schedule or availability information is given preferential treatment in how it is displayed.
          
          
            § 256.6
            No requirement to provide access to systems.
            Nothing in this section requires an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent to allow a system to access its internal computer reservation system or to permit “screen scraping” or “content scraping” of its Web site; nor does it require an air carrier or foreign air carrier to permit the marketing or sale of the carrier's services through any ticket agent or other carrier's system. “Screen scraping” as used in this paragraph refers to a process whereby a company uses computer software techniques to extract information from other companies' Web sites without permission from the company operating the targeted Web site.

            Unfair and deceptive practice.
            The holding out or sale of scheduled passenger air transportation involving a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease is prohibited as unfair and deceptive in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712 unless, in conjunction with such holding out or sale, carriers and ticket agents follow the requirements of this part.
          
          
            § 257.5
            Notice requirement.
            (a) Notice in flight itineraries and schedules. Each air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent providing flight itineraries and/or schedules for scheduled passenger air transportation to the public in the United States and to the Official Airline Guides and comparable publications, and, where applicable, computer reservation systems, shall ensure that each flight on which the designator code is not that of the operating carrier is clearly and prominently identified and contains the following disclosures. If there is more than one operating carrier for a particular flight (e.g., change of gauge), the required disclosures shall be made for each flight segment where the designator code is not that of the operating carrier.
            (1) In flight schedule information provided by an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent to U.S. consumers on desktop browser-based Web sites or applications in response to any requested itinerary search, for each flight in scheduled passenger air transportation that is operated by a carrier other than the one listed for that flight, the corporate name of the transporting carrier and any other name under which the service is held out to the public must appear prominently in text format, with font size not smaller than the font size of the flight itinerary itself, on the first display following the input of a search query, immediately adjacent to each code-share flight in that search-results list. Roll-over, pop-up and linked disclosures do not comply with this paragraph.
            (2) In flight schedule information provided by an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent to U.S. consumers on mobile browser-based Web sites or applications in response to any requested itinerary search, for each flight in scheduled passenger air transportation that is operated by a carrier other than the one listed for that flight, the corporate name of the transporting carrier must appear prominently in text format, with font size not smaller than the font size of the flight itinerary itself, on the first display following the input of a search query, immediately adjacent to each code-share flight in that search-results list. Roll-over, pop-up and linked disclosures do not comply with this paragraph.
            (3) For static written schedules, each flight in scheduled passenger air transportation that is operated by a carrier other than the one listed for that flight shall be identified by an asterisk or other easily identifiable mark that leads to disclosure of the corporate name of the operating carrier and any other name under which that service is held out to the public.
            (4) Each air carrier and foreign air carrier that provides flight schedule information to any computer reservation system or global distribution system that receives and distributes the U.S. or foreign carrier's fare, schedule, or availability information shall ensure that each flight on which the designator code is not that of the operating carrier is clearly and prominently identified and the corporate name of the transporting carrier and any other name under which the service is held out to the public appears prominently in text format, with font size that is not smaller than the font size of the flight itinerary itself, immediately adjacent to each code-share flight in that search-results list.
            (b) Notice in oral communications with prospective consumers. In any direct oral communication in the United States with a prospective consumer, and in any telephone call placed from the United States by a prospective consumer, concerning a flight within, to, or from the United States that is part of a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease, a ticket agent doing business in the United States or a carrier shall inform the consumer, the first time that such a flight is offered to the consumer, or, if no such offer was made, the first time a consumer inquires about such a flight, that the operating carrier is not the carrier whose name or designator code will appear on the ticket and shall identify the transporting carrier by its corporate name and any other name under which that service is held out to the public.
            (c) Notice in ticket confirmations. At the time of purchase, each selling carrier or ticket agent shall provide written disclosure of the actual operator of the flight to each consumer of scheduled passenger air transportation sold in the United States that involves a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease. For any flight on which the designator code is not that of the operating carrier the notice shall state “Operated by” followed by the corporate name of the transporting carrier and any other name in which that service is held out to the public. The following form of statement will satisfy the requirement of this paragraph:
            
              Important Notice: Service between XYZ City and ABC City will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines d/b/a QRS Express. At the purchaser's request, the notice required by this part may be delivered in person, or by fax, electronic mail, or any other reliable method of transmitting written material.
            (d) In any written advertisement distributed in or mailed to or from the United States (including those that appear on an internet Web site that is marketed to consumers in the United States) for service in a city-pair market that is provided under a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease, the advertisement shall prominently disclose that the advertised service may involve travel on another carrier and clearly indicate the nature of the service in reasonably sized type and shall identify all potential operating carriers involved in the markets being advertised by corporate name and by any other name under which that service is held out to the public. In any radio or television advertisement broadcast in the United States for service in a city-pair market that is provided under a code-sharing or long-term wet lease, the advertisement shall include at least a generic disclosure statement, such as “Some flights are operated by other airlines.”

            § 258.2
            Applicability.
            This part applies to the following:

            Unfair and deceptive practice.
            The holding out or sale of scheduled passenger air transportation that involves change-of-gauge service is prohibited as an unfair or deceptive practice or an unfair method of competition within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712 unless, in conjunction with such holding out or sale, carriers and ticket agents follow the requirements of this part.
          
          
            § 258.5
            Notice requirement.

              Notice: Change of Aircraft Required
              For at least one of your flights, you must change aircraft en route even though your ticket may show only one flight number and have only one flight coupon for that flight. Further, in the case of some travel, one of your flights may not be identified at the airport by the number on your ticket, or it may be identified by other flight numbers in addition to the one on your ticket. At your request, the seller of this ticket will give you details of your change of aircraft, such as where it will occur and what aircraft types are involved.

            § 259.4
            Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays.
            (a) Adoption of Plan. Each covered carrier shall adopt a Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays for its scheduled and public charter flights at each U.S. large hub airport, medium hub airport, small hub airport and non-hub airport at which it operates or markets such air service and shall adhere to its plan's terms.
            (b) Contents of Plan. Each Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays shall include, at a minimum, the following:

            (1) For domestic flights, assurance that the covered U.S. air carrier will not permit an aircraft to remain on the tarmac for more than three hours before allowing passengers to deplane unless:
            (i) The pilot-in-command determines there is a safety-related or security-related reason (e.g. weather, a directive from an appropriate government agency) why the aircraft cannot leave its position on the tarmac to deplane passengers; or
            (ii) Air traffic control advises the pilot-in-command that returning to the gate or another disembarkation point elsewhere in order to deplane passengers would significantly disrupt airport operations.
            (2) For international flights operated by covered carriers that depart from or arrive at a U.S. airport, assurance that the carrier will not permit an aircraft to remain on the tarmac at a U.S. airport for more than four hours before allowing passengers to deplane, unless:
            (i) The pilot-in-command determines there is a safety-related or security-related reason why the aircraft cannot leave its position on the tarmac to deplane passengers; or
            (ii) Air traffic control advises the pilot-in-command that returning to the gate or another disembarkation point elsewhere in order to deplane passengers would significantly disrupt airport operations.
            (3) For all flights, assurance that the carrier will provide adequate food and potable water no later than two hours after the aircraft leaves the gate (in the case of a departure) or touches down (in the case of an arrival) if the aircraft remains on the tarmac, unless the pilot-in-command determines that safety or security considerations preclude such service;
            (4) For all flights, assurance of operable lavatory facilities, as well as adequate medical attention if needed, while the aircraft remains on the tarmac;
            (5) For all flights, assurance that the passengers on the delayed flight will receive notifications regarding the status of the delay every 30 minutes while the aircraft is delayed, including the reasons for the tarmac delay, if known;
            (6) For all flights, assurance that the passengers on the delayed flight will be notified beginning 30 minutes after scheduled departure time (including any revised departure time that passengers were notified about before boarding) and every 30 minutes thereafter that they have the opportunity to deplane from an aircraft that is at the gate or another disembarkation area with the door open if the opportunity to deplane actually exists;
            (7) Assurance of sufficient resources to implement the plan; and
            (8) Assurance that the plan has been coordinated with airport authorities (including terminal facility operators where applicable) at each U.S. large hub airport, medium hub airport, small hub airport and non-hub airport that the carrier serves, as well as its regular U.S. diversion airports;
            (9) Assurance that the plan has been coordinated with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at each large U.S. hub airport, medium hub airport, small hub airport and non-hub airport that is regularly used for that carrier's international flights, including diversion airports; and
            (10) Assurance that the plan has been coordinated with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at each U.S. large hub airport, medium hub airport, small hub airport and non-hub airport that the carrier serves, including diversion airports.
            (c) Code-Share Responsibility. The tarmac delay contingency plan of the carrier under whose code the service is marketed governs, if different from the operating carrier, unless the marketing carrier specifies in its contract of carriage that the operating carrier's plan governs.
            (d) Amendment of plan. At any time, a carrier may amend its Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays to decrease the time for aircraft to remain on the tarmac for domestic flights covered in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for aircraft to remain on the tarmac for international flights covered in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and for the trigger point for food and water covered in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. A carrier may also amend its plan to increase these intervals (up to the limits in this rule), in which case the amended plan shall apply only to departures that are first offered for sale after the plan's amendment.
            
            (e) Retention of records. Each carrier that is required to adopt a Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays shall retain for two years the following information about any tarmac delay that lasts more than three hours:
            (1) The length of the delay;
            (2) The precise cause of the delay;
            (3) The actions taken to minimize hardships for passengers, including the provision of food and water, the maintenance and servicing of lavatories, and medical assistance;
            (4) Whether the flight ultimately took off (in the case of a departure delay or diversion) or returned to the gate; and

            (5) An explanation for any tarmac delay that exceeded 3 hours (i.e., why the aircraft did not return to the gate by the 3-hour mark).
            (f) Unfair and deceptive practice. A carrier's failure to comply with the assurances required by this rule and contained in its Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays will be considered to be an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712 that is subject to enforcement action by the Department.

            (a) Adoption of Plan. Each covered carrier shall adopt a Customer Service Plan applicable to its scheduled flights and shall adhere to the plan's terms.
            (b) Contents of Plan. Each Customer Service Plan shall address the following subjects and comply with the minimum standards set forth:
            (1) Disclosing on the carrier's website, at the ticket counter, or when a customer calls the carrier's reservation center to inquire about a fare or to make a reservation, that the lowest fare offered by the carrier may be available elsewhere if that is the case;
            (2) Notifying consumers of known delays, cancellations, and diversions as required by 14 CFR 259.8 of this chapter;
            (3) Delivering baggage on time, including making every reasonable effort to return mishandled baggage within twenty-four hours, compensating passengers for reasonable expenses that result due to delay in delivery, as required by 14 CFR part 254 for domestic flights and as required by applicable international agreements for international flights, and reimbursing passengers for any fee charged to transport a bag if that bag is lost;

            (a) Designated advocates for passengers' interests. Each covered carrier shall designate for its scheduled flights an employee who shall be responsible for monitoring the effects of flight delays, flight cancellations, and lengthy tarmac delays on passengers. This employee shall have input into decisions on which flights to cancel and which will be delayed the longest.
            (b) Informing consumers how to complain. Each covered carrier shall make available the mailing address and e-mail or web address of the designated department in the airline with which to file a complaint about its scheduled service. This information shall be provided on the U.S. carrier's website (if any) and the foreign carrier's website (if marketed to U.S. consumers), on all e-ticket confirmations and, upon request, at each ticket counter and boarding gate staffed by the carrier or a contractor of the carrier.

            § 259.8
            Notify passengers of known delays, cancellations, and diversions.

            (a) Each covered carrier for its scheduled flights to, from or within the U.S. must promptly provide to passengers who are ticketed or hold reservations, and to the public, information about a change in the status of a flight within 30 minutes after the carrier becomes aware of such a change in the status of a flight. A change in the status of a flight means, at a minimum, a cancellation, diversion or delay of 30 minutes or more in the planned operation of a flight that occurs within seven calendar days of the scheduled date of the planned operation. The flight status information must at a minimum be provided in the boarding gate area for the flight at a U.S. airport, on the carrier's website, and via the carrier's telephone reservation system upon inquiry by any person.

            (1) With respect to any U.S. air carrier or foreign air carrier that permits passengers and other interested persons to subscribe to flight status notification services, the carrier must deliver such notification to such subscribers, by whatever means the carrier offers that the subscriber chooses.
            (2) The U.S. carrier or foreign air carrier shall incorporate such notification service commitment into its Customer Service Plan as specified in section 259.5 of this chapter.
            (b) For its scheduled flights to, from or within the U.S, within 30 minutes after the carrier becomes aware of a flight cancellation, a flight delay of 30 minutes or more, or a flight diversion, each covered carrier must update all flight status displays and other sources of flight information that are under the carrier's control at U.S. airports with information on that flight irregularity.
            (c) If an airport-controlled display system at a U.S. airport accepts flight status updates from carriers, covered carriers must provide flight irregularity information to that airport for the carrier's scheduled flights to, from or within the U.S. within 30 minutes after the carrier becomes aware of such a change in the status of a flight. Flight irregularity refers to flight cancellations, flight delays of 30 minutes or more, and diversions.

            This part establishes the guidelines required by 49 U.S.C. 41736 to be used by the Department in establishing the fair and reasonable amount of compensation needed to ensure the continuation of essential air service to an eligible place under 49 U.S.C. 41731 and 41734. These guidelines are intended to cover normal carrier selection cases and rate renewal cases, and not necessarily emergency carrier selection cases.

            Definitions.
            As used in this part:
            
              Eligible place means a place in the United States that—
            (1) Was an eligible point under section 419 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 as in effect before October 1, 1988;
            (2) Received scheduled air transportation at any time between January 1, 1990, and November 4, 1990; and
            (3) Is not listed in Department of Transportation Orders 89-9-37 and 89-12-52 as a place ineligible for compensation under Subchapter II of Chapter 417 of the Statute.
            
              Essential air service is that air transportation which the Department has found to be essential under Subchapter II of Chapter 417 of the Statute.

            § 271.3
            Carrier subsidy need.
            In establishing the subsidy for an air carrier providing essential air service at an eligible place, the Department will consider the following:
            (a) The reasonable projected costs of a carrier in serving that place;
            (b) The carrier's reasonable projected revenues for serving that place;
            (c) The appropriate size of aircraft for providing essential air service at that place; and
            (d) A reasonable profit for a carrier serving that place.
            [ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, Aug. 22, 1995]
          
          
            
            § 271.4
            Carrier costs.
            (a) The reasonable costs projected for a carrier providing essential air service at an eligible place will be evaluated:
            (1) For costs attributable to the carrier's flying operations (direct expenses), by comparing the projected costs submitted by the carrier with the following:
            (i) The carrier's historical direct operating costs with the same or similar aircraft types;
            (ii) The direct operating unit costs of similar carriers using the same or similar equipment; and
            (iii) Data supplied by the manufacturer of the carrier's aircraft.
            (2) For other costs, by one or more of the following methods:
            (i) By direct assignment where the indirect costs are attributable to the carrier's operations at the eligible place;
            (ii) By comparing the carrier's systemwide indirect operating expenses to those submitted by the carrier for the eligible place; or
            (iii) By comparing the indirect operating expenses submitted by the carrier with the ratio of indirect to direct costs that have been experienced by the carrier in other markets or to costs that are representative of the industry.
            (3) By considering the unique circumstances of the carrier or the community being served that justify deviations from the costs that would otherwise be established for that carrier under this paragraph.
            (4) By determining whether the aircraft to be used by the carrier at the eligible place, and on which its costs are derived, are appropriate for providing essential air service there. The appropriateness of the aircraft to be used is based on the following characteristics of the eligible place:
            (i) Traffic levels;
            (ii) The level of air service that the Department has decided is essential for the eligible place;
            (iii) Distance to the designated hub;
            (iv) The altitude at which the carrier must fly to the designated hub; and
            (v) Other operational elements involved.
            (b) When the essential air service would be made part of the carrier's linear system, the Department might, instead of the factors in paragraph (a) of this section, consider only the incremental costs that the carrier will incur in adding that service to its system.
            [ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, 43525, Aug. 22, 1995]
          
          
            § 271.5
            Carrier revenues.
            (a) The projected passenger revenue for a carrier providing essential air service at an eligible place will be calculated by multiplying the following:
            (1) A reasonable projected net fare, which is the standard fare expected to be charged for service between the eligible place and the designated hub less any dilution caused by joint fare arrangements, discount fares that it offers, or prorates of fares for through one-line passengers; and
            (2) The traffic (including both local and beyond traffic) projected to flow between the eligible place and the designated hub or hubs, which is based on the carrier's own estimates, Department estimates, and on traffic levels in the market at issue when such data are available.
            (b) The reasonableness of a carrier's passenger revenue projections will be evaluated by:
            (1) Comparing the carrier's proposed fare with the fare charged in other city-pair markets of similar distances and traffic densities; and
            (2) Comparing the carrier's proposed pricing structure with historical pricing practices in the market at issue, with the pricing practices of that carrier in other markets, and with any standard industry pricing guidelines that may be available.
            (c) An estimate of freight and other transport-related revenue will be included as a component of projected revenues and will be based on recent experience in the market involved and on the experience of the carrier involved in other markets.

            § 271.6
            Profit element.

            The reasonable return for a carrier for providing essential air service at an eligible place generally will be set at a flat percentage, typically 5 percent of that carrier's projected operating costs as established under § 271.4, plus any applicable interest expenses on flight equipment.

            § 271.7
            Subsidy payout formula.
            (a) Subsidy will be paid by the Department to the air carrier monthly, based on the subsidy rate established by the Department for the carrier under this part. Payments will not vary except as provided in this section.
            (b) While a carrier's subsidy rate will not vary even if actual revenues or costs differ from projections, the actual amount of each payment may vary depending on the following factors:
            (1) Seasonal characteristics of the carrier's operations at the eligible place;
            (2) The actual number of flights completed, aircraft miles flown, available seat-miles flown, or variations in other operational elements upon which the subsidy rate is based; or
            (3) Adjustments to the carrier's subsidy required by § 271.8(b).
            (c) Payments will continue for the duration of the rate term established under § 271.8 provided that the carrier continues to provide the required service.

            § 271.8
            Rate period.
            (a) The subsidy rate generally will be set for a 2-year period, or two consecutive 1-year periods. The Department may set the rate for a shorter period in the following situations:
            (1) A commuter air carrier is replacing a larger certificated carrier at the eligible place;
            (2) Traffic at the eligible place has substantially decreased;
            (3) The Department considers the cost or revenue projections of the carrier for the second year to be unrealistic;
            (4) It is likely that there will be changes in the eligible place essential air service level; or
            (5) The uncertainties of the market or other circumstances warrant a shorter rate period.
            (b) The subsidy rate established for a carrier under this part will not be changed during the rate period unless an adjustment is required in the public interest.
            (c) At the end of the rate period, the carrier will not have a continuing right to receive subsidy for providing essential air service at the eligible place.

            § 271.9

            (b) Within 1 year after it first receives a subsidy under this part, the carrier shall evaluate its practices and procedures for accommodating the handicapped in accordance with § 382.23 of this chapter.
            (c) All air carriers seeking a subsidy under this part shall include in their subsidy application the assurances required by 49 CFR parts 20, 21, 27 and 29, and § 382.21 of this chapter.

            Applicability of procedures and policies under 49 U.S.C. 41731-42.
            Since the authority of the Department to guarantee essential air service is derived from the Federal Programs and Services Agreement and the Compact of Free Association, the provisions and procedures utilized by the Department in implementation of 49 U.S.C. 41731-42 will be followed only to the extent determined by the Department to be consistent with the obligations assumed by the United States in the Agreement and Compact, and the provisions of this part.

            Determination of essential air service.

            Procedures for the determination of essential air service under this section, and review of that determination, shall, except to the extent otherwise directed by the Department, be governed by § 325.4 (except the application of 49 U.S.C. 41737 in § 325.4(b)); § 325.6(a); §§ 325.8-325.11; § 325.12 (provided that all documents shall be served on the President and the designated authorities of the Freely Associated State concerned); and §§ 325.13 and 325.14 of this chapter.

            § 272.6
            Considerations in the determination of essential air service.
            (a) In the determination of essential air service to an eligible Freely Associated State place, the Department shall consider, among other factors, the following:
            (1) The demonstrated level of traffic demand;
            (2) The amount of compensation necessary to maintain a level of service sufficient to meet that demand;
            (3) The extent to which the demand may be accommodated by connecting or other services of U.S., Freely Associated State, or foreign carriers by air—through U.S., Freely Associated State, or foreign places—that provide access to the U.S. air transportation system;
            (4) Alternative modes of transportation that may be available; and
            (5) The peculiar needs of the Freely Associated States for air transportation services.
            (b) The Guidelines for Individual Determinations of essential air service set forth in part 398 of this chapter shall be applied only to the extent the Department concludes that they are applicable to the special circumstances affecting transportation to the Freely Associated States and reflective of the provisions of this part.
            (c) Nothing in this part shall be construed as providing for a level of essential air service that would exceed the level of service justified by the considerations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
            [Amdt. 272-1, 52 FR 5443, Feb. 23, 1987, as amended at 60 FR 43525, Aug. 22, 1995]
          
          
            § 272.7
            Notice of discontinuance of service.
            (a) An air carrier or Freely Associated State Air Carrier shall not terminate, suspend, or reduce air service to any eligible Freely Associated State place, unless it has given notice as specified in this section, if as a result of the reduction of such service the aggregate of the remaining air service provided to such place would be below:
            (1) If the Department has not made a determination of essential air service for such place, the level of service specified in Order 80-9-63; and
            (2) If the Department has made a determination of essential air service for such place, that level of essential air service.
            (b) An air carrier or Freely Associated State Air Carrier wishing to terminate, suspend or reduce air service under paragraph (a) shall file a notice of such proposed reduction in service at least 90 days prior to such service reduction, in accordance with the procedures specified in §§ 323.4, 323.6, and 323.7 of this chapter.
            (c) The notice shall be served on the President and the designated Authorities of the Freely Associated State concerned, in addition to the persons specified in § 323.7.
            (d) The procedures specified in §§ 323.9-323.18, to the extent applicable to 90-day notices filed by certificated air carriers, shall also be applicable to notices of terminations, suspensions or reductions in service filed under this section.
            [Amdt. 272-1, 52 FR 5443, Feb. 23, 1987, as amended at 60 FR 43525, Aug. 22, 1995]
          
          
            § 272.8
            Obligation to continue service.
            (a) If the Department finds that a proposed termination, suspension, or reduction in service by an air carrier or Freely Associated State Air Carrier will, or may, reduce service to an eligible Freely Associated State place below the level of essential air service to such place, whether or not the Department has previously determined the level of essential air service to such place, the Department may direct the air carrier or Freely Associated State Air Carrier concerned to maintain service to such place at a level the Department determines will ensure essential air service to such place, pending the commencement of alternative service as required to maintain the level of essential air service previously, or thereafter, determined by the Department.

            (b) During any period the Department requires an air carrier or Freely Associated State Air Carrier to maintain a level of service proposed to be terminated, suspended or reduced, following the filing of a 90 day notice in accordance with § 272.7, the Department will provide for the payment of compensation to such carrier for any losses incurred by that carrier as a result of such required continuation of service in accordance with the procedures set forth in part 271 of this chapter. If the carrier is already receiving compensation pursuant to § 272.9 of this part, the Department will continue to direct payment of such compensation during any period the carrier is required to maintain service. Such payments shall be made by the Department of Interior from funds appropriated for this purpose.
            (c) The Department will review its order from time to time and will revise the level of required service as necessary to maintain only the level of essential air service determined by the Department for that place, considering all other service to such place in accordance with § 272.6(a)(3).
            (d) During the period any such air carrier or Freely Associated State Air Carrier is required to maintain service under this section, the Department will make every effort to obtain alternative service, with compensation if necessary, as required to maintain essential air service to such place.

            § 272.9
            Selection of a carrier to provide essential air service and payment of compensation.
            (a) If the Department finds that essential air service will not be maintained to an eligible Freely Associated State place, the Department shall invite applications to provide the service required to maintain essential air service to such place.
            (b) If the Department determines that essential air service will not be provided to such place in the absence of the payment of subsidy compensation to a carrier or carriers, the Department shall determine the compensation necessary, considering all other service to such place in accordance with § 272.6(a)(3), to maintain the level of essential air service determined by the Department under § 272.5, and the times and manner of the payment of such compensation.
            (c) The compensation determined by the Department to be necessary to maintain essential air service to such place shall be paid by the Department of Interior out of funds appropriated for that purpose, to the carrier or carriers selected by the Department.
            (d) The Department shall continue to specify compensation to be paid to a carrier or carriers under this section only as long as the Department determines that essential air service will not be provided to the Freely Associated State in the absence of the payment of such compensation.
            (e) Except as permitted in paragraph (f) of this section, the Department shall select a U.S. air carrier or carriers to provide essential air service for compensation.
            (f) The Department may select a Freely Associated State Air Carrier, holding a foreign air carrier permit issued in accordance with subpart D of part 211 of this chapter, to provide essential air service for compensation, only if—
            (1) No U.S. air carrier is available to provide the required essential air service; or
            (2) The compensation necessary for the provision of the required essential air service would be substantially less than the compensation necessary if such essential air service were to be provided by a U.S. air carrier.
            (g) Any order of the Department selecting a Freely Associated State Air Carrier to provide such essential air service shall be submitted to the President of the United States not less than 10 days prior to its effective date and shall be subject to stay or disapproval by the President.
            (h) Among the criteria that will be considered by the Department in its determination of the carrier or carriers to be selected to perform the required essential air service are:
            (1) The desirability of developing an integrated linear system of air transportation whenever such a system most adequately meets the air transportation needs of the Freely Associated States concerned;

            (2) The experience of the applicant in providing scheduled air service in the vicinity of the Freely Associated States for which essential air service is proposed to be provided;
            (3) The amount of compensation that will be required to provide the proposed essential air service;
            (4) The impact of the proposed service on service provided to other Freely Associated State points; and
            (5) The views of the Governments of the Freely Associated States concerned.
            (i) The Department may from time to time, on its own motion, or upon application of any carrier or government, review and change its selection of a carrier to provide essential air service, or its determination as to the compensation necessary to provide such essential air service.
            (j) All applications or other documents filed or issued in proceedings under this section shall be served upon the President of the Freely Associated State concerned and the Authorities designated by that Government(s) in accordance with Article II, paragraph 10, of the Federal Programs and Services Agreement supplemental to the Compact of Free Association, and such Government shall be a party to any such proceeding. In reaching its determination, the Department will carefully consider any views of such Government that have been submitted.

            § 272.10
            Conditions applicable to carriers serving a subsidized market.
            (a) The Department may, after providing an opportunity for comment by the carrier or carriers affected, impose service, fare or rate conditions on any U.S., Freely Associated State, foreign air carrier, or foreign carrier by air as a precondition to the payment of compensation necessary to maintain essential air service, whether or not the affected carrier is itself receiving subsidy compensation in the market, if it finds that:
            (1) Essential air service in a Freely Associated State market or markets will not be provided in the absence of the payment of compensation;
            (2) Specified service, rate or fare conditions are or will be necessary or desirable to minimize the required subsidy compensation; and
            (3) The imposition of such conditions will not unduly impair the service provided in the market.
            (b) To the extent the carrier or carriers upon whom the conditions are imposed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section do not hold a certificate, permit, or other authority from the Department that may be amended to effectively implement the specified conditions, the Department may notify the Government(s) of the Freely Associated States concerned that the imposition of such conditions on those carriers by those Governments shall be a precondition to the payment of the subsidy compensation required to maintain essential air service in the market in question.
            (c) The Department may withhold or suspend its provision for the payment of subsidy compensation required to maintain essential air service unless and until the Freely Associated State(s) concerned take the necessary action to impose the specified conditions on the carriers referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, and those carriers have complied with the specified conditions.
            (d) Any order of the Department imposing conditions, or requiring the imposition of conditions, pursuant to this paragraph shall be submitted to the President for review not less than 10 days prior to its effective date, and shall be subject to stay or disapproval by the President.

              BTS Schedule P-12(a), Fuel Consumption by Type of Service and Entity.
              (a) For the purposes of BTS schedule P-12(a), type of service shall be either scheduled service or nonscheduled service as those terms are defined in § 291.45(c)(2) and (3).
              (b) For the purpose of this schedule, scheduled service shall be reported separately for:
              (1) Intra-Alaskan operations;

              (2) Domestic operations, which shall include all operations within and between the 50 States of the United States (except Intra-Alaska), the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession to a place in any State of the United States the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession;
              
              (3) International operations are flight stages with one or both terminals outside the 50 States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession.
              (c) For the purpose of this schedule, nonscheduled service shall be reported separately for domestic operations and international operations as defined in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, except that domestic and international Military Airlift Command (MAC) operations shall be reported on separate lines.
              (d) The cost data reported on each line shall represent the average cost of fuel, as determined at the station level, consumed in that geographic entity.
              (e)(1) The cost of fuel shall include shrinkage, but excludes:
              (i) “Throughput” and “in to plane” fees, i.e., service charges or gallonage levies assessed by or against the fuel vendor or concessionaire and passed on to the carrier in a separately identifiable form; and
              (ii) Nonrefundable Federal and State excise taxes.
              (2) However, “through-put” and “in to plane” charges that cannot be identified or segregated from the cost of fuel shall remain a part of the cost of fuel as reported on this schedule.
              (f) Each air carrier shall maintain records for each station showing the computation of fuel inventories and consumption for each fuel type. The periodic average cost method shall be used in computing fuel inventories and consumption. Under this method, an average unit cost for each fuel type shall be computed by dividing the total cost of fuel available (Beginning Inventory plus Purchases) by the total gallons available. The resulting unit cost shall then be used to determine the ending inventory and the total consumption costs to be reported on this schedule.
              (g) Where amounts reported for a specific entity include other than Jet A fuel, a footnote shall be added indicating the number of gallons and applicable costs of such other fuel included in amounts reported for that entity.
              (h) Where any adjustment(s) recorded on the books of the carrier results in a material distortion of the current month's schedule, carriers shall file a revised Schedule P-12(a) for the month(s) affected.

              BTS Schedule T-100, U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market.
              (a) Each section 41103 all-cargo air carrier shall file Schedule T-100, “U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market”.
              (b) Schedule T-100 shall be filed monthly.
              (1) Schedule T-100 collects summarized flight stage data and on-flight market data for revenue flights. All traffic statistics shall be compiled in terms of each flight stage as actually performed. The detail T-100 data shall be maintained in such a manner as to permit monthly summarization and organization into two basic groupings. First, the nonstop segment information which is to be summarized by equipment type, within class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard to individual flight number. The second grouping requires that the enplanement/deplanement information be broken out into separate units called on-flight market records, which shall be summarized by class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard for equipment type or flight number.
              (2) Joint-service operations. The Department may authorize joint-service operations between two direct air carriers. Examples of these joint-service operations are: blocked-space agreements; part-charter agreements; code-sharing agreements; wet-lease agreements, and similar arrangements.
              (i) Joint-service operations are reported by the carrier in operational control of the flight, i.e., the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority. The traffic moving under these agreements is reported on Schedule T-100 the same way as any other traffic on the aircraft.

              (ii) If there are questions about reporting a joint-service operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director—Airline Information (fax no. 202 366-3383, telephone no. 202 366-4373). Joint-service operations are reported in Schedule T-100 in accordance with this paragraph (b).
              (iii) Operational control. The air carrier in operational control of the aircraft (the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority) must report joint services.
              (c) Service classes. (1) The statistical classifications are designed to reflect the operating characteristics attributable to each distinctive type of service offered. The combination of scheduled and nonscheduled operations with passenger, all-cargo, and military services are placed into service classes as follows:

              (2) Scheduled services include traffic and capacity elements applicable to air transportation provided pursuant to published schedules and extra sections of scheduled flights. Scheduled Passenger/Cargo (Service Class F) is a composite of first-class, coach, and mixed passenger/cargo service.
              (3) Nonscheduled services include all traffic and capacity elements applicable to the performance of nonscheduled aircraft charters, and other air transportation services not constituting an integral part of services performed pursuant to published flight schedules.
              (d) Air transport traffic and capacity elements. Within each of the service classifications, carriers shall report air transport traffic and capacity elements. The elements are reported on segment and/or market records as follows:

                Appendix to § 291.45—Instructions to U.S. Air Carriers for Reporting Traffic and Capacity Data on Schedule T-100
                (a) Format of reports—(1) Automatic Data Processing (ADP) magnetic tape. Refer to paragraph (d) of this appendix for instructions pertaining to mainframe and minicomputer reporting. The Department will issue “Accounting and Reporting Directives” to make necessary technical changes to these T-100 instructions. Technical changes which are minor in nature do not require public notice and comment.
                (2) Microcomputer diskette—(i) Optional specification. If an air carrier desires to use its personal computers (PC's), rather than mainframe or minicomputers to prepare its data submissions, the following specifications for filing data on diskette media apply.
                (ii) Reporting medium. Microcomputer ADP data submission of T-100 information must be on IBM compatible disks. Carriers wishing to use a different ADP procedure must obtain written approval to do so from the BTS Assistant Director—Airline Information. Requests for approval to use alternate methods must disclose and describe the proposed data transmission methodology. Refer to paragraph (i) of this appendix for microcomputer record layouts.
                (iii) Microcomputer file characteristics. The files will be created in ASCII delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format (DIF). This form of recording data provides for variable length fields (data elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by quotation marks (“) and separated by a comma (,) or tab. Numeric data elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by a comma (,) or tab. The data are identified by their juxtaposition within a given record. Therefore, each record must contain the exact number of data elements, all of which must be juxtapositionally correct. Personal computer software including most spreadsheets, data base management programs, and BASIC are capable of producing files in this format.
                (b) Filing date for reports. The reports must be received at BTS within 30 days following the end of each reporting period.
                (c) Address for filing. Data Administration Division, K-14, Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590-0001.
                (d) ADP format for magnetic tape—(1) Magnetic tape specifications. IBM compatible 9-track EBCDIC recording. Recording density of 6250 or 1600 bpi. The order of recorded information is:
                (i) Volume label.
                (ii) Header label.
                (iii) Data records.
                (iv) Trailer label.
                (2) [Reserved]
                (e) External tape label information. (1) Carrier name.
                (2) Report date.
                (3) File identification.
                (4) Carrier address for return of tape reel.
                (f) Standards. It is the policy of the Department to be consistent with the American National Standards Institute and the Federal Standards Activity in all data processing and telecommunications matters. It is our intention that all specifications in this application are in compliance with standards promulgated by these organizations.
                (g) Volume, header, and trailer label formats—(1) Use standard IBM label formats. The file identifier field of the header labels should be “T-100.SYSTEM”.
                
                (h) Magnetic tape record layouts for T-100—(1) Nonstop segment record layout.

                (i) Record layouts for microcomputer diskettes. The record layouts for diskette are generally identical to those shown for magnetic tape, with the exception that delimiters (quotation marks, tabs and commas) are used to separate fields. It is necessary that the order of fields be maintained in all records.
                (1) File characteristics. The files will be created in ASCII delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format (DIF). This form of recording data provides for variable length fields (data elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by quotation marks (“) and separated by a comma (,) or tab. Numeric data elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by a comma (,) or tab. The data are identified by their juxtaposition within a given record. Therefore, it is critical that each record contain the exact number of data elements, all of which must be juxtapositionally correct. PC software including most spreadsheets, data base management programs, and BASIC produce minidisk files in this format.
                (2) File naming conventions for diskettes. For microcomputer reports, each record type should be contained in a separate DOS file on the same physical diskette. The following DOS naming conventions should be followed:
                (i) Record type S = SEGMENT.DAT
                (ii) Record type M = MARKET.DAT

              § 291.60
              Public disclosure of data.
              (a) Detailed domestic on-flight market data and nonstop segment data, except military data, shall be made publicly available after processing. Domestic data are defined as data from air transportation operations from a place in any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession to a place in any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession. Domestic military operations are reported under service codes N or R.

              (b) Detailed international on-flight market and nonstop segment data in Schedule T-100 and Schedule T-100(f) reports, except military data, shall be publicly available immediately following the Department's determination that the database is complete, but no earlier than six months after the date of the data. Military operations are reported under service codes N or R. Data for on-flight markets and nonstop segments involving no U.S. points shall not be made publicly available for three years. Industry and carrier summary data may be made public before the end of six months or the end of three years, as applicable, provided there are three or more carriers in the summary data disclosed. The Department may, at any time, publish international summary statistics without carrier detail. Further, the Department may release nonstop segment and on-flight market detail data by carrier before the end of the confidentiality period as follows:
              (1) To foreign governments as provided in reciprocal arrangements between the foreign country and the U.S. Government for exchange of on-flight market and/or nonstop segment data submitted by air carriers of that foreign country and U.S. carriers serving that foreign country.
              (2) To parties to any proceeding before the Department under Title IV of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, as required by an Administrative Law Judge or other decision-maker of the Department. Parties may designate agents or consultants to receive the data in their behalf, provided the agents or consultants agree to abide by the disclosure restrictions. Any data to which access is granted pursuant to this provision may be introduced into evidence, subject to the normal rules of admissibility.
              (3) To agencies or other components of the U.S. Government for their internal use only.

              Revocation of exemption.

              (a) The Department, upon complaint or upon its own initiative, may, immediately and without hearing, revoke, in whole or in part, the exemption granted by this part with respect to a carrier or carriers, when such action is in the public interest.

              § 292.20
              Rule of construction.

              Carriers holding an effective exemption from the duty to file tariffs under this part shall not, unless otherwise directed by order of the Department, be subject to tariff posting, notification or subscription requirements set forth in 49 U.S.C. 41504 or 14 CFR part 221, except as provided in § 292.21 of this part.

              (a) Carriers holding an effective exemption from the duty to file tariffs under this part may incorporate contract terms by reference (i.e. without stating their full text) into the waybill or other document embodying the contract of carriage for the scheduled transportation of cargo in foreign air transportation, provided that:
              
              (1) The notice, inspection, explanation and other requirements set forth in 14 CFR 221.177(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(4), (b), (c) and (d) are complied with, to the extent applicable, except that the notice required under 14 CFR 221.177(b)(1) shall refer to the title or general nature of the publication(s) or document(s) containing the full text of the referenced terms rather than to “terms and conditions filed in public tariffs with U.S. authorities”;
              (b) In addition to other remedies at law, a carrier may not claim the benefit as against a shipper or consignee of, and a shipper or consignee shall not be bound by, any contract term which is incorporated by reference under this part unless the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are complied with, to the extent applicable; and
              (c) The purpose of this section is to set uniform disclosure requirements, which preempt any State requirements on the same subject, for terms incorporated by reference into contracts of carriage for the scheduled transportation of cargo in foreign air transportation.

              (b) As of March 1, 1996, all remaining cargo tariffs on file with the Department cease to be effective as tariffs under 49 U.S.C. 41504 and the provisions of 14 CFR part 221, and are cancelled by operation of law. Any such tariffs may be cancelled voluntarily prior to that date. With respect to terms expressly agreed in the contract of carriage, carriers, agents and other persons are relieved from the requirement of adherence to filed tariffs in 49 U.S.C. 41510 and the related provisions of 14 CFR part 221 as of November 30, 1995.
              (c) Applications for filing and/or effectiveness of any cargo tariffs pending on November 30, 1995 are dismissed by operation of law. No new filings or applications will be permitted except as provided under § 292.11.

              Exemption.
              (a) Air carriers and foreign air carriers are exempted from the duty to file passenger tariffs with the Department of Transportation, as required by 49 U.S.C. 41504 and 14 CFR part 221, as follows:
              (1) The Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs will, by notice, issue and periodically update a list establishing the following categories of markets:
              (i) In Category A markets, carriers are exempted from the duty to file all passenger tariffs unless they are nationals of countries listed in Category C, or are subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
              (ii) In Category B markets, carriers are exempted from the duty to file all passenger tariffs except those setting forth one-way economy-class fares and governing provisions thereto, unless they are nationals of countries listed in Category C, or are subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
              (iii) In Category C markets, carriers shall continue to file all passenger tariffs, except as provided in § 293.10(b);
              (2) The Assistant Secretary will list country-pair markets falling in Categories A and C, taking into consideration the factors in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section. All country-pair markets not listed in Categories A or C shall be considered to be in Category B and need not be specifically listed.
              (i) Whether the U.S. has an aviation agreement in force with that country providing double-disapproval treatment of prices filed by the carriers of the Parties;
              (ii) Whether the country's Government has disapproved or deterred U.S. carrier price leadership or matching tariff filings in any market;
              (iii) Whether the country's Government has placed significant restrictions on carrier entry or capacity in any market; and
              (iv) Whether the country's government is honoring the provisions of the bilateral aviation agreement and there are no significant bilateral problems.
              (b) By notice of the Assistant Secretary, new country-pair markets will be listed in the appropriate category, and existing country-pair markets may be transferred between categories.
              (c) Notwithstanding a determination that a country is in Category A or B, if the Assistant Secretary finds that effective price leadership opportunities for U.S. carriers are not available between that country and any third country, carriers that are nationals of such country may be required to file tariffs, as provided under part 221 or as otherwise directed in the notice, for some or all of their services between the U.S. and third countries.
              (d) Air carriers and foreign air carriers are exempted from the duty to file governing rules tariffs containing general conditions of carriage with the Department of Transportation, as required by 49 U.S.C. 41504 and 14 CFR part 221. A description of the general conditions of carriage will be included in the Assistant Secretary's initial notice.
              (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this section, air carriers and foreign air carriers shall file and maintain a tariff with the Department to the extent required by 14 CFR 203.4 and other implementing regulations.

              (f) Authority for determining what rules are covered by paragraph (d) of this section and for determining the filing format for the tariffs required by paragraph (e) of this section is delegated to the Director of the Office of International Aviation.
            
            
              § 293.11
              Required statement.
              Each governing rules tariff shall include the following statements:
              (a) “Rules herein containing general conditions of carriage are not part of the official U.S. D.O.T. tariff.”
              (b) “The rules and provisions contained herein apply only to the passenger fares and charges that the U.S. Department of Transportation requires to be filed as tariffs.”
            
            
              § 293.12
              Revocation of exemption.
              (a) The Department, upon complaint or upon its own initiative, may, immediately and without hearing, revoke, in whole or in part, the exemption granted by this part with respect to a carrier or carriers, when such action is in the public interest.
              (b) Any such action will be taken in a notice issued by the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, and will identify the tariff matter to be filed, and the deadline for carrier compliance.
              (c) Revocations under this section will have the effect of reinstating all applicable tariff requirements and procedures specified in the Department's Regulations for the tariff material to be filed, unless otherwise specified by the Department.

              Carriers holding an effective exemption from the duty to file tariffs under this part may incorporate contract terms by reference (i.e., without stating their full text) into the passenger ticket or other document embodying the contract of carriage for the scheduled transportation of passengers in foreign air transportation, provided that:
              (a) The notice, inspection, explanation and other requirements set forth in 14 CFR 221.107, paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) are complied with, to the extent applicable;
              (b) In addition to other remedies at law, a carrier may not claim the benefit under this section as against a passenger, and a passenger shall not be bound by incorporation of any contract term by reference under this part, unless the requirements of paragraph (a), of this section are complied with, to the extent applicable; and
              (c) The purpose of this section is to set uniform disclosure requirements, which preempt any State requirements on the same subject, for incorporation of terms by reference into contracts of carriage for the scheduled transportation of passengers in foreign air transportation.

              (a) One hundred and eighty days after the date of effectiveness of the Assistant Secretary's notice, passenger tariffs on file with the Department covered by the scope of the exemption will cease to be effective as tariffs under 49 U.S.C. 41504 and 41510, and the provisions of 14 CFR part 221, and will be canceled by operation of law.
              (b) One hundred and eighty days after the date of effectiveness of the Assistant Secretary's notice, pending applications for filing and/or effectiveness of any passenger tariffs covered by the scope of the exemption, will be dismissed by operation of law. No new filings or applications will be permitted after the date of effectiveness of the Assistant Secretary's notice except as provided under § 293.12.

              § 294.1
              Applicability and purpose.
              This part establishes a classification of foreign air carriers known as “Canadian charter air taxi operators,” and establishes registration procedures for these carriers operating or seeking to operate transborder services between Canada and the United States. This part also exempts Canadian charter air taxi operators from certain provisions of the Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation), and establishes rules applicable to their operations in the United States. This part does not provide exemption from the safety regulatory provisions of the Statute that are administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Canadian charter air taxi operators in the conduct of their operations must observe all applicable safety standards and requirements.
              [ER-1257, 46 FR 52591, Oct. 27, 1981, as amended at 60 FR 43526, Aug. 22, 1995]
            
            
              § 294.2
              Definitions.
              As used in this part:
              (a) Agreement means the Air Transport Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada, signed at Ottawa, February 24, 1995, with Annexes and any amendments, supplements, reservations, or supersessions to it.
              (b) Canadian charter air taxi operator means a foreign air carrier that is substantially owned and effectively controlled by Canadian citizens, the Government of Canada, or both, whose foreign air transportation operations are limited to charter air service between points in Canada and points in the United States, and that does not use large aircraft in those operations.
              (c) Charter air service means nonscheduled commercial air transportation of persons and their accompanied baggage, and of property, on a time, mileage, or trip basis where the entire planeload capacity of one or more aircraft has been engaged, or the transportation of mail by aircraft.
              
              (d) Large aircraft means any aircraft that are not small aircraft as defined in this section.
              (e) Maximum authorized takeoff weight has the meaning assigned to it in regulations of the Canadian Transport Commission.
              (f) Maximum certificated takeoff weight means the maximum takeoff weight authorized by the terms of the aircraft airworthiness certificate. This weight may be found in the airplane operating record or in the airplane flight manual that is incorporated by regulation into the airworthiness certificate.
              (g) Maximum passenger capacity means the maximum number of passenger seats for which an aircraft is configured.
              (h) Maximum payload capacity means the maximum certificated takeoff weight of an aircraft less the empty weight as defined in section 03 of part 241 of this chapter, less all justifiable aircraft equipment, and less the operating load (consisting of minimum fuel load, oil, flight crew, steward's supplies, etc.). For purposes of this part, the allowance for weight of the crew, oil and fuel is as follows:
              (1) Crew—200 pounds per crew member required under FAA regulations, (2) oil—350 pounds, (3) fuel—the minimum weight of fuel required under FAA regulations for a flight between domestic points 200 miles apart, assuming VFR weather conditions and flights not involving extended overwater operations. However, in the case of aircraft for which a maximum zero fuel weight is prescribed by the FAA, maximum payload capacity means the maximum zero fuel weight less the empty weight, less all justifiable aircraft equipment, and less the operating load (consisting of minimum flight crew, steward's supplies, etc., but not including disposable fuel or oil).
              (2) [Reserved]
              (i) Small aircraft means any aircraft designed to have:
              (1) A maximum passenger capacity of not more than 30 seats and a maximum payload capacity of not more than 7,500 pounds, and/or
              (2) maximum authorized takeoff weight on wheels not greater than 35,000 pounds.

              (b) Air charter brokers may display their name and logo on aircraft provided the name of the direct air carrier is displayed prominently and clearly on the aircraft and consumers are not otherwise misled into thinking that the air charter broker is a direct air carrier or direct foreign air carrier.

              (3) If the air charter broker is acting as the agent of the charterer, the air charter broker must disclose the existence of any corporate or business relationship, including a preexisting contract, between the air charter broker and the direct air carrier or direct foreign air carrier that will be in operational control of the flight that may have a bearing on the air charter broker's selection of the direct carrier that will be in operational control of the flight.
              (4) The total cost of the air transportation paid by the charterer to or through the air charter broker, including any air charter broker or carrier-imposed fees or government-imposed taxes and fees. Specific individual fees, taxes, or costs may, but are not required to be itemized.

              (1) Misrepresentations that may induce members of the public to reasonably believe that the air charter broker is a direct air carrier or direct foreign air carrier when that is not the case.
              (2) Misrepresentations as to the quality or kind of service or type of aircraft.
              (3) Misrepresentations as to the time of departure or arrival, points served, route to be flown, stops to be made, or total trip-time from point of departure to destination.
              (4) Misrepresentations as to the qualifications of pilots or safety record or certification of pilots, aircraft, or air carriers.
              (5) Misrepresentations that passengers are directly insured when they are not so insured. For example, where the only insurance in force is that protecting the direct air carrier or air charter broker in event of liability.
              (6) Misrepresentations as to fares or charges for air transportation or services in connection therewith.
              (7) Misrepresentations as to membership in or involvement with an organization that audits air charter brokers, direct air carriers, or direct foreign air carriers, or that the air charter broker or any direct carriers to be used for a particular flight meets a standard set by an auditing organization.
              (8) Representing that a contract for a specified direct air carrier, direct foreign air carrier, aircraft, flight, or time has been arranged without a binding commitment with a direct air carrier or direct foreign air carrier for the furnishing of such transportation as represented.
              (9) Selling or contracting for air transportation while knowing or having reason to know or believe that such air transportation cannot be legally performed by the direct air carrier or foreign direct air carrier that is to perform the air transportation.
              (10) Misrepresentations as to the requirements that must be met by charterers to qualify for charter flights.
              (11) Using or displaying or permitting or suffering to be used or displayed the name, trade name, slogan or any abbreviation thereof, of the air charter broker in advertisements, on or in places of business, or on or in aircraft or any other place in connection with the name of an air carrier or foreign air carrier or with services in connection with air transportation, in such manner that it may mislead or confuse potential consumers with respect to the status of the air charter broker.

              § 296.3
              Indirect cargo air carrier.
              An indirect cargo air carrier is any U.S. citizen who undertakes to engage indirectly in air transportation of property, and uses for the whole or any part of such transportation the services of an air carrier or a foreign air carrier that directly engages in the operation of aircraft under a certificate, regulation, order, or permit issued by the Department of Transportation or the Civil Aeronautics Board, or the services of its agent, or of another indirect cargo air carrier.

              § 296.5
              Agency relationships.
              An indirect cargo air carrier may act as agent of a shipper, or of a direct air carrier that has authorized such agency, rather than as an air carrier, if it expressly reserves the option to do so when the shipment is accepted.
            
            
              § 296.6
              Public disclosure of cargo liability limits and insurance.

The notice shall be clear and conspicuously included on or attached to all of its rate sheets and airwaybills.

              (3) Section 41310 (nondiscrimination) with respect to foreign air transportation.
              (4) Section 41708 (accounts, records, and reports) and section 41709 (inspection of accounts and property);

              (b) Each registered foreign indirect air carrier shall prepare an accurate manifest showing every individual shipment included in each shipment consigned for transportation to a direct air carrier.
              (c) A waiver of paragraph (a) of this section may be granted by the Department upon a written application by the foreign indirect air carrier not less than 30 days before the shipment to which it relates is transported, if the waiver is in the public interest, and is warranted by special or unusual circumstances.

              § 298.1
              Applicability of part.

              This part establishes classifications of air carriers known as “air taxi operators” and “commuter air carriers,” provides certain exemptions to them from some of the economic regulatory provisions of Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation), specifies procedures by which such air carriers may obtain authority to conduct operations, and establishes rules applicable to their operations in interstate and/or foreign air transportation in all States, Territories and possessions of the United States. This part also establishes reporting requirements for commuter air carriers and small certificated air carriers.
            
            
              § 298.2
              Definitions.
              As used in this part:
              
                Air taxi operator means an air carrier as established by § 298.3(a).
              
                Air transportation means interstate air transportation, foreign air transportation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft as defined by the Statute. 1
                
              
              
                

                  1 Interstate air transportation is defined in section 40102(a)(25) as the transportation of passengers or property by aircraft as a common carrier for compensation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft (1) between a place in (i) a State, territory, or possession of the United States and a place in the District of Columbia or another State, territory, or possession of the United States; (ii) Hawaii and another place in Hawaii through the airspace over a place outside Hawaii; (iii) the District of Columbia and another place in the District of Columbia; or (iv) a territory or possession of the United States and another place in the same territory or possession; and (2) when any part of the transportation is by aircraft. Note: Operations wholly within the geographic limits of a single State are not considered interstate air transportation if in those operations the carrier transports no more than a de minimis volume of passengers or property moving as part of a continuous journey to or from a point outside the State.
                Foreign air transportation is defined in section 40102(a)(23) of the Statute as the transportation of passengers or property by aircraft as a common carrier for compensation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft, between a place in the United States and a place outside the United States when any part of the transportation is by aircraft.
                Air transportation also is defined to include the transportation of mail by aircraft. Section 5402 of the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C. 5402, authorizes the carriage of mail by air taxi operators and commuter air carriers in some circumstances under contract with the U.S. Postal Service.

                Aircraft miles means the miles (computed in airport-to-airport distances) for each flight stage actually completed, whether or not performed in accordance with the scheduled pattern.
              
                Certificated air carrier means an air carrier holding a certificate issued under section 41102 of the Statute.
              
                Citizen of the United States means:

              (2) A partnership each of whose partners is an individual who is a citizen of the United States; or
              (3) A corporation or association organized under the laws of the United States or a state, the District of Columbia, or a territory or possession of the United States, of which the president and at least two-thirds of the board of directors and other managing officers are citizens of the United States, which is under the actual control of citizens of the United States, and in which at least 75 percent of the voting interest is owned or controlled by persons that are citizens of the United States.
              
                Commuter air carrier means an air carrier as established by § 298.3(b) that carries passengers on at least five round trips per week on at least one route between two or more points according to its published flight schedules that specify the times, days of the week, and places between which those flights are performed.

              (ii) Received scheduled air transportation at any time after January 1, 1990; and
              (iii) Is not listed in Department of Transportation Orders 89-9-37 and 89-12-52 as a place ineligible for compensation under Subchapter II of Chapter 417 of the Statute; or
              (2) Was determined, on or after October 1, 1988, and before the date of the enactment of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, by the Department to be eligible to receive subsidized small community air service under section 41736(a) of the Statute.
              
                Flight stage means the operation of an aircraft from takeoff to landing.

                  2 This weight may be found in the airplane operating record or in the airplane flight manual, which is incorporated by regulation into the airworthiness certificate.
              
              
                Maximum passenger capacity means the maximum number of passenger seats for which an aircraft is configured.
              
                Maximum payload capacity means: (1) The maximum certificated take-off weight of an aircraft, less the empty weight,3
                 less all justifiable aircraft equipment, and less the operating load (consisting of minimum fuel load, oil, flight crew, steward's supplies, etc.). For purposes of this part, the allowance for the weight of the crew, oil, and fuel is as follows:
              
                
                  3 Empty weight is defined in section 03 of part 241 as follows: the weight of the airframe, engines, propellers, and fixed equipment. Empty weight excludes the weight of the crew and payload, but includes the weight of all fixed ballast, unusable fuel supply, undrainable oil, total quantity of engine coolant, and total quantity of hydraulic fluid.
              
              (i) Crew—200 pounds per crew member required under FAA regulations,

              (2) Provided, however, That in the case of aircraft for which a maximum zero fuel weight is prescribed by the FAA, 5
                 maximum payload capacity means the maximum zero fuel weight, less the empty weight, less all justifiable aircraft equipment, and less the operating load (consisting of minimum flight crew, steward's supplies, etc., but not including disposable fuel or oil).
              
                
                  5 The maximum zero fuel weight is the maximum permissible weight of an airplane with no disposable fuel or oil. The zero fuel weight figure may be found in the FAA's type certificate data sheets, and/or in FAA-approved flight manuals.
              
              
                Mile means a statute mile, i.e., 5,280 feet.
              
                Nonrevenue passenger means a person traveling free or under token charges, except those expressly named in the definition of revenue passenger; a person traveling at a fare or discount available only to employees or authorized persons of air carriers or their agents or only for travel on the business of the carriers; and an infant who does not occupy a seat.

              § 298.52
              Air taxi operations by commuter air carriers.
              (a) A commuter air carrier that holds an effective Commuter Air Carrier Authorization and otherwise meets the requirements of this part is also authorized to conduct air taxi operations (e.g., scheduled cargo, mail under a U.S. Postal Service contract, on-demand passenger, on-demand cargo, or other service such as air ambulance operations, firefighting or seasonal operations) without having to meet the registration requirements of subpart C of this part, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

              (b) Should a commuter air carrier cease conducting all scheduled passenger operations and its Commuter Air Carrier Authorization is suspended pursuant to §§ 298.53 and/or 204.7 of this chapter, it may continue to conduct air taxi operations provided that the carrier maintains in effect liability insurance coverage as required for such operations by part 205 of this chapter and, within 10 days of the cessation of scheduled passenger operations, registers as an air taxi operator in accordance with subpart C of this part; and 
                provided further that the carrier continues to hold authority from the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct such air taxi operations.
            
            
              § 298.53
              Suspension or revocation of authority.
              A Commuter Air Carrier Authorization may be suspended or revoked if any of the following occur:
              (a) The operator fails to maintain insurance coverage as required by part 205 of this chapter for commuter operations;
              (b) The scheduled passenger authority under the operator's Air Carrier Certificate is suspended or revoked by the Federal Aviation Administration;
              (c) The operator does not commence operations for which it has been found fit, or the operator ceases those operations as provided in § 204.7 of this chapter;
              (d) The Department finds that the carrier is not fit, willing, and able to conduct scheduled service or fails to qualify as a citizen of the United States; or
              (e) The Department determines that it is otherwise in the public interest to do so.
            
          
          
            Subpart F—Reporting Requirements
            
              § 298.60
              General reporting instructions.
              (a) Each commuter air carrier and each small certificated air carrier shall file with the Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) the applicable schedules of BTS Form 298-C, A Report of Financial and Operating Statistics for Small Aircraft Operators' and Schedule T-100, AU.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market” as required by this section.
              (b) A single copy of the BTS Form 298-C report shall be filed quarterly with the Office of Airline Information (OAI) for the periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year to be received on or before May 10, August 10, November 10, and February 10, respectively. An electronic filing of the monthly Schedule T-100 is due at OAI within 30 days after the end of each month. Due dates falling on a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday will become effective on the next work day.
              (c) Reports required by this section shall be submitted to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in a format specified in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Director of Airline Information.
              [ER-1399, 50 FR 19, Jan. 2, 1985, as amended by Doc. No. 47939, 57 FR 40104, Sept. 2, 1992; 60 FR 66726, Dec. 26, 1995; 67 FR 49231, July 30, 2002; 75 FR 41585, July 16, 2010]
            
            
              § 298.61
              Reporting of traffic statistics.
              (a) Each commuter air carrier and small certificated air carrier shall file Schedule T-100, AU.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market.”
              (b) Schedule T-100 shall be filed monthly as set forth in “298.60.
              (1) Schedule T-100 collects summarized flight stage data and on-flight market data from revenue flights. All traffic statistics shall be compiled in terms of each flight stage as actually performed. The detail T-100 data shall be maintained in such a manner as to permit monthly summarization and organization into two basic groupings. The first grouping, the nonstop segment information, is to be summarized by equipment type, within class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard to individual flight number. The second grouping requires that the enplanement/deplanement information be broken out into separate units called on-flight market records, which shall be summarized by class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard for equipment type or flight number.
              (2) Joint-service operations. The Department may authorize joint service operations between two direct air carriers. Examples of these joint-service operations are: blocked-space agreements; part-charter agreements; code-sharing agreements; wet-lease agreements, and similar arrangements.

              (i) Joint-service operations are reported by the carrier in operational control of the flight, i.e., the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority. The traffic moving under these agreements is reported on Schedule T-100 the same way as any other traffic on the aircraft.
              (ii) If there are questions about reporting a joint-service operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director—Airline Information (fax no. 202 366-3383, telephone no. 202 366-4373). Joint-service operations are reported in Schedule T-100 in accordance with this paragraph (b).
              (iii) Operational control. The air carrier in operational control of the aircraft (the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority) must report joint-service operations.
              (c) Service classes. (1) The statistical classifications are designed to reflect the operating characteristics attributable to each distinctive type of service offered. The combination of scheduled and nonscheduled operations with passenger, all-cargo, and military services are placed into service classes as follows:
              
                
                  Code
                  Type of Service

                  L
                  Nonscheduled Civilian Passenger/Cargo
                
                
                  P
                  Nonscheduled Civilian Cargo
                
                
                  N
                  Nonscheduled Military Passenger/Cargo
                
                
                  R
                  Nonscheduled Military Cargo
                
              
              (2) Scheduled services include traffic and capacity elements applicable to air transportation provided pursuant to published schedules and extra sections of scheduled flights. Scheduled Passenger/Cargo (Service Class F) is a composite of first class, coach, and mixed passenger/cargo service.
              (3) Nonscheduled services include all traffic and capacity elements applicable to the performance of nonscheduled aircraft charters, and other air transportation services not constituting an integral part of services performed pursuant to published flight schedules.
              (d) Air transport traffic and capacity elements. (1) Within each of the service classifications, carriers shall report air transport traffic and capacity elements. The elements are reported on segment or market records as follows:

              (e) These reported items are further described as follows:
              (1) Reporting period date. The year and month to which the reported data are applicable.
              (2) Carrier, Carrier entity code. Each air carrier shall report its name and entity code (a five digit code assigned by BTS that identifies both the carrier and its entity) for its particular operations. The Office of Airline Information (OAI) will assign or confirm codes upon request; OAI's address is Office of Airline Information, BTS, DOT, K-14, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590-0001.
              (3) Service class code. The service class codes are prescribed in section 298.61(c). In general, classes are divided into two broad categories, either scheduled or nonscheduled, where scheduled = F + G and nonscheduled = L + N + P + R.
              (4) Record type code. This code indicates whether the data pertain to non-stop segment (record type S) or on-flight market (record type M).
              (5) Aircraft type code. This code represents the aircraft types, as described in the BTS' Accounting and Reporting Directives.
              (6) Origin, Destination airport code(s). These codes represent the industry designators. An industry source of these industry designator codes is the Official Airline Guide (OAG). OAI assigns codes upon request if not listed in the OAG.
              (7) 110 Revenue passengers enplaned. The total number of revenue passengers enplaned at the origin point of a flight, boarding the flight for the first time; an unduplicated count of passengers in a market. Under the T-100 system of reporting, these enplaned passengers are the sum of the passengers in the individual on-flight markets. In the domestic entity, report only the total revenue passengers enplaned in item 110.
              (8) 130 Revenue passengers transported. The total number of revenue passengers transported over a single flight stage, including those already on the aircraft from a previous flight stage. In the domestic entity, report only the total revenue passengers transported in item 130.
              (9) 140 Revenue passenger-miles. Computed by multiplying the inter-airport distance of each flight stage by the number of passengers transported on that flight stage.
              (10) 210 Revenue cargo tons enplaned. The total number of cargo tons enplaned. This data element is a sum of the individual on-flight market figures for each of the following categories: 217 Freight and 219 Mail. This element represents an unduplicated count of the revenue traffic in a market.
              (11) 217 Enplaned freight. The total weight of revenue freight enplaned at the origin point of a flight, loaded onto the flight for the first time; an unduplicated count of freight in a market.
              (12) 219 Enplaned mail. The total weight of mail enplaned at the origin point of a flight, loaded onto the flight for the first time; an unduplicated count of mail in a market.
              (13) 230 Revenue tons transported. The number of tons of revenue traffic transported. This element is the sum of the following elements: 231 Passengers transported-total, 237 Freight, and 239 Mail.
              (14) 237 Transported freight. The total weight of freight transported over a single flight stage, including freight already on the aircraft from a previous flight stage.
              (15) 239 Transported mail. The total weight of mail transported over a single flight stage, including mail already on the aircraft from a previous flight stage.
              (16) 240 Revenue ton-miles—total. Ton-miles are computed by multiplying the revenue aircraft miles flown (410) on each flight stage by the number of tons transported on that stage. This element is the sum of 241 through 249.

            § 300.0
            Applicability.
            The rules of conduct set forth in this part except as otherwise provided in this or any other DOT regulation shall govern the conduct of the parties and their representatives, and the relationships between the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, and the Office of the General Counsel, including regular personnel, and officials, special Government employees, consultants, or experts under contract to the Department of Transportation (DOT) and administrative law judges (hereinafter referred to as “DOT employee(s)”) and all other persons in all DOT matters involving aviation economic and enforcement proceedings.
            [Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2380, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended by Amdt. 1-261, 59 FR 10061, Mar. 3, 1994; 60 FR 43528, Aug. 22, 1995]
          
          
            § 300.0a
            Applicability of 49 CFR part 99.
            (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each DOT employee involved in matters covered by this chapter shall comply with the rules on “Employee Responsibilities and Conduct” in 49 CFR part 99.
            (b) The rules in this part shall be construed as being consistent with those in 49 CFR part 99. If a rule in this part is more restrictive than a rule in 49 CFR part 99, the more restrictive rule shall apply.
          
          
            § 300.1
            Judicial standards of practice.

            Certain of DOT's functions involving aviation economic and enforcement proceedings are similar to those of a court, and parties to cases before DOT and those who represent such parties are expected—in fact and in appearance—to conduct themselves with honor and dignity as they would before a court. By the same token, any DOT employee or administrative law judge carrying out DOT's quasi-judicial functions and any DOT employee making recommendations or advising them are expected to conduct themselves with the same fidelity to appropriate standards of propriety that characterize a court and its staff. The standing and effectiveness of DOT in carrying out its quasi-judicial functions are in direct relation to the observance by DOT, DOT employees, and the parties and attorneys appearing before DOT of the highest standards of judicial and professional ethics. The rules of conduct set forth in this part are to be interpreted in light of those standards.
            [Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2380, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43528, Aug. 22, 1995]
          
          
            § 300.2
            Prohibited communications.
            (a) Basic requirement. Except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) there shall be no substantive communication in either direction between any concerned DOT employee and any interested person outside DOT, concerning a public proceeding, until after final disposition of the proceeding, other than as provided by Federal statute or published DOT rule or order.
            (b) Definitions. For purposes of this part:
            (1) A “substantive communication” is any written or oral communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding.
            (2) The “DOT decisionmaker” is defined in 14 CFR 302.2 and 302.18.
            (3) A “concerned DOT employee” is a DOT employee who is or may reasonably be expected to be directly involved in a decision which is subject to a public proceeding.
            (4) A “public proceeding” is one of the following:
            (i) A hearing proceeding (i.e., proceeding conducted on-the record after notice and opportunity for an oral evidentiary hearing as provided in §§ 302.17-302.38)
            (ii) A rulemaking proceeding involving a hearing as described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section or an exemption proceeding covered by this chapter. (Other rulemaking proceedings are covered by the ex parte communication policies of DOT Order 2100.2.)
            (iii) A tariff filing after DOT has ordered an investigation or a complaint has been filed or docketed.
            (iv) A proceeding initiated by DOT show-cause order, after the filing in the docket of an identifiable written opposition to the order's tentative findings.
            (v) Any other proceeding initiated by a docket filing, other than a petition for generally applicable rulemaking, after the filing in the docket of an identifiable written opposition to the initiating document.
            (c) General exceptions. Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to the following:
            (1) Informal communications between legal counsel, including discussions about stipulations and other communications considered proper in Federal court proceedings.
            (2) Information given to a DOT employee who is participating in a hearing case on behalf of an office that is a party, to another DOT employee who is reviewing that work, or to his or her supervisors within that office.
            (3) Communications made in the course of an investigation to determine whether formal enforcement action should be begun.
            (4) Settlement discussions and mediation efforts.
            (5) Information given at the request of a DOT employee acting upon a specific direction of DOT, in a case other than a hearing proceeding as described in paragraphs (b)(4) (i) and (ii) (a “nonhearing case”), where DOT has decided that emergency conditions exist and this rule would otherwise prevent the obtaining of needed information in a timely manner.
            (6) Information given at the request of a DOT employee in a tariff matter after a complaint is filed but before an investigation is ordered.
            (7) Nonhearing cases that are to be decided within 30 days after the filing of the initiating document.
            (8) Nonhearing cases arising under 49 U.S.C. 41731-42.
            (9) In nonhearing cases, communications with other Federal agencies not exempted by paragraph (e) of this section, provided the agencies have not participated as parties in the proceeding by making filings on-the-record.

            (10) Information given at the request of a DOT career employee in the course of investigating or clarifying information filed, or pursuant to a waiver granted to an applicant or other interested person, in docketed proceedings involving determinations of fitness and/or U.S. citizenship only, for that portion of the proceeding that precedes the issuance of a show-cause order or an order instituting a formal proceeding. Motions for such waivers and any answers shall be filed in the applicable docket in accordance with § 302.11 of the Department's Procedural Regulations (14 CFR 302.11) and served upon all parties to the proceeding.
            (d) Status and expedition requests. Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to oral or written communications asking about the status, or requesting expeditious treatment, of a public proceeding. However, any request for expeditious treatment should be made in accordance with the Rules of Practice, particularly Rule 11, § 302.11 of this chapter.
            (e) National defense and foreign policy. In nonhearing cases, paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to communications concerning national defense or foreign policy matters, including international aviation matters. In hearing cases, any communications on those subjects that would be barred by paragraph (a) of this section are permitted if the communicator's position with respect thereto cannot otherwise be fairly presented, but such communications shall not be included as part of the record on which decisions must be made.
            (f) Communications not considered. A communication in violation of this section shall not be considered part of a record, or included as available material, for decision in any proceeding.

            (4) Copies of all filings under this part dealing with discontinuances or reductions of air transportation shall be mailed to the directly affected local communities, State agencies, and airport managers.
            (c) Status and expedition requests.

            [Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2380, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43528, Aug. 22, 1995; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2002-12200, 67 FR 30325, May 6, 2002]
          
          
            § 300.4
            Separation of functions in hearing cases.
            (a) This section applies after the initiation of a hearing or enforcement case by the Department.

            (b) A DOT employee who is participating in a hearing case on behalf of an office that is a party, another DOT employee who is in fact reviewing the position taken, or who has participated in developing the position taken in that case, or, in cases involving accusatory or disciplinary issues (including all enforcement cases) such employees' supervisors within that office, shall have no substantive communication with any DOT decisionmaker, administrative law judge in the case, or other DOT employee advising them, with respect to that or any factually related hearing case, except in accordance with a published DOT rule or order. In addition, each bureau or office supervisor of a DOT employee who is participating in a hearing case on behalf of that office when it is a party shall have no substantive communication with any administrative law judge in the case, or DOT employee advising the judge, in that or any factually related hearing case, except in accordance with a published DOT rule or order. For each hearing case, bureau or office heads shall maintain a publicly available record of those employees who are participating or are in fact reviewing the position taken, or who have participated in developing the position taken in that case.
            (c) In hearing cases involving fares or rates, or applications for a certificate or permit under 49 U.S.C. 41102 and 41302, or applications by a holder for a change in a certificate or permit, a supervisor who would not be permitted to advise the DOT decisionmaker under paragraph (a) may advise the DOT decisionmaker in the following manner: The supervisor's advice must either be made orally in an open DOT meeting or by a memorandum placed in the docket or other public file of such matter. Oral advice must be summarized in writing by the supervisor and placed in the docket or file of the matter. A copy of such written memorandum or summary of oral advice must be served on each party to the proceeding within 3 business days after such advice is given to the concerned DOT decisionmaker. Each of the parties may comment in writing on such advice within 5 business days after service or the summary. In no event, however, may a supervisor advise the DOT decisionmaker if he or she acted as the office's counsel or witness in the matter.
            (d) In enforcement cases, the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings, under the supervision of the Deputy General Counsel, will conduct all enforcement proceedings and related investigative functions, while the General Counsel will advise the DOT decisionmaker in the course of the decisional process. The Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings will report to the Deputy General Counsel. To ensure the independence of these functions, this Office and the Deputy General Counsel, for the purpose of this section, shall be considered an “office” as that term is used in paragraph (a), separate from the General Counsel and the rest of the Office of the General Counsel.
            [Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2380, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43528, Aug. 22, 1995]

            (b) Disrupt or interfere with the fair and orderly disposition of a DOT proceeding.
          
          
            § 300.6
            Practitioners' standards of conduct.
            Every person representing a client in matters before DOT in all contacts with DOT employees, should:
            (a) Strictly observe the standards of professional conduct;
            (b) Refrain from statements or other actions designed to mislead DOT or to cause unwarranted delay;
            (c) Avoid offensive or intemperate behavior;
            (d) Advise all clients to avoid improprieties and to obey the law as the attorney believes it to be; and
            (e) Terminate the professional relationship with any client who persists in improprieties in proceedings before DOT.
          
          
            § 300.7
            Conciseness.

            Every oral or written statement made in a DOT proceding shall be as concise as possible. Verbose or redundant presentations may be rejected.
          
          
            § 300.8
            Gifts and hospitality and other conduct affecting DOT employees.
            (a) No person, otherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty, shall directly or indirectly give, offer, or promise anything of value to any DOT employee for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such DOT employee (18 U.S.C. 201).
            (b) Subject to 49 CFR part 99, it is improper for persons interested in the business of DOT to provide hospitality, gifts, entertainment, or favors to any DOT employee.
            (c) Persons interested in the business of DOT should familiarize themselves with (49 CFR part 99), in order that they shall not encourage or cause any violation of the provisions of that part by any DOT employee.
          
          
            § 300.9
            Permanent disqualification of employees from matters in which they personally participated before joining DOT or the Civil Aeronautics Board.
            Any DOT employee shall permanently disqualify himself or herself from participation in every matter before the Department in which he or she previously personally and substantially participated for an interested person or entity, including other agencies of the United States Government, before joining the DOT or the Civil Aeronautics Board. Such disqualification shall be applicable also if a person is closely related to is a DOT employee as partner, associate, employer, or the like, personally and substantially participated in a matter before DOT prior to the employee's employment by the Department or the Civil Aeronautics Board and the circumstances were such that the DOT employee's subsequent participation in the matter as a DOT employee could fairly be said to create the appearance that his or her participation would be affected by his or her prior relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the disqualification of any DOT employee, including any member of a DOT employee's personal staff or a special Government employee, whose prior personal and substantial participation in a DOT or Civil Aeronautics Board proceeding or whose relationship to one who so participated occurred on behalf of another agency of the United States Government shall only be applicable with respect to issues on which the prior governmental employer took a position in the proceeding unless participation could fairly be said to create the appearance that his or her participation would be affected by his or her prior relationship.
          
          
            § 300.10
            Temporary disqualification of employees from matters in which they had official responsibility before joining DOT.

            Any DOT employee shall temporarily disqualify himself or herself from participation in any matter before DOT if he or she represented, was associated with or was employed by an interested person or entity including other agencies of the United States Government before joining DOT, and, although he or she did not personally and substantially participate in the matter, the matter was within his or her “official responsibility,” as that term is defined in § 300.14 of this chapter except that the action referred to therein shall be private action as well as “Government” action. Such disqualification shall be applicable also if a person closely related to the DOT employee as partner, associate, employer, or the like, who, while not personally and substantially participating in the matter, had it within his or her “official responsibility” as that term is defined in § 300.14 of this chapter, and modified above, and the circumstances are such that the DOT employee's subsequent participation in the matter as a DOT employee could fairly be said to create the appearance that his or her participation would be affected by his or her prior relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the disqualification of any DOT employee whose prior “official responsibility” or relationship to one with such responsibility occurred on behalf of another agency of the United States Government shall only be applicable with respect to issues on which the prior governmental employer took a position in the proceeding. The temporary disqualification shall run for a period of one year from the date of the termination of the representation, association, or employment with the interested person or entity.
            [Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2380, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43528, Aug. 22, 1995]

            Disqualification of Government officers and employees.
            No officer or employee of the Federal Government, other than a “special Government employee” as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202, shall represent anyone, otherwise than in the proper discharge of his or her official duties, in any DOT proceeding or matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest.

            Practice of special Government employees permitted.
            A special Government employee, who qualifies as such under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 202(a), may participate in DOT proceedings only to the extent and in the manner specified in 18 U.S.C. 205.
          
          
            § 300.13
            Permanent disqualification of former Civil Aeronautics Board members and employees and DOT employees from matters in which they personally participated.
            No former Board member or employee or DOT employee shall act as agent or attorney before DOT for anyone other than the United States in connection with any proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, or other particular matter, involving a specific party or parties, in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest and in which he or she participated personally and substantially through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise as a Board member or employee or DOT employee.

            § 300.14
            Temporary disqualification of former DOT employees from matters formerly under their official responsibility.
            Within one year after termination of employment with DOT, no former DOT employee shall appear personally before DOT on behalf of any person other than the United States in any DOT proceeding or matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest and which was under his or her official responsibility at any time within one year preceding termination of such responsibility.

            [Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2380, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43528, Aug. 22, 1995]
          
          
            § 300.15
            Opinions or rulings by the General Counsel.
            (a) The General Counsel is authorized to render opinions or rulings to the public on the application of the provisions of this part. When written request is made for such opinions and rulings, they shall be transmitted to DOT and shall be available to the public in the Documentary Services Division after any appeal to or review by the Secretary has been completed or after the time for review has expired. Identifying details shall normally be stricken from copies available to the public unless the public interest requires disclosure of such details.

            (b) If any person is disqualified from a particular proceeding under the provisions of §§ 300.9, 300.10, 300.13, 300.14, and 300.17 of this chapter by a ruling of the General Counsel, or by such person's own action, such disqualification shall be memorialized in a writing filed in the appropriate file of the matter by the General Counsel or such person.
          
          
            § 300.16
            Waivers.
            (a) A former Board member, Board employee or DOT employee with outstanding scientific or technological qualifications who is disqualified from acting in a representative capacity under the provisions of § 300.13 or § 300.14 of this chapter may nevertheless participate in a proceeding in a scientific or technological field pursuant to the terms of a certificate issued in compliance with the proviso following 18 U.S.C. 207 (a) and (b).
            (b) An employee who believes his or her prior employment relationships will not affect the integrity of his or her services may request that the prohibition of § 300.9 or § 300.10 of this chapter be waived by the appropriate Ethics Counselor under 49 CFR 99.735-71.
          
          
            § 300.17
            Disqualification of partners of DOT employees.
            No partner of a DOT employee shall act as agent or attorney for anyone other than the United States in any DOT proceeding or matter in which such employee participates or has participated personally and substantially through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, rendering advice, investigation, or otherwise, or which is the subject of his or her official responsibility.
          
          
            § 300.18
            Motions to disqualify DOT employee in review of hearing matters.
            In cases to be determined on an evidentiary record, a party desiring that a concerned DOT employee disqualify himself or herself from participating in a DOT decision shall file a motion supported by an affidavit setting forth the grounds for such disqualification in the form and within the periods prescribed in § 302.11 of this chapter. Where review of the administrative law judge's decision can be obtained only upon the filing of a petition for discretionary review, such motions must be filed on or before the date answers are due pursuant to § 302.32. In cases where exceptions are filed to recommended, initial, or tentative decisions or where the DOT decisionmaker orders review of an initial or recommended decision on his or her own initiative, such motions must be filed on or before the date briefs are due pursuant to § 302.35 or § 302.218, as applicable. Failure to file a timely motion will be deemed a waiver of disqualification. Applications for leave to file an untimely motion seeking disqualification of a concerned DOT employee must be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth in detail why the facts relied upon as grounds for disqualification were not known and could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence within the prescribed time.

            § 300.19
            Use of confidential information.
            No former CAB member or employee or DOT employee, or any person associated with him or her, shall ever use or undertake to use in any DOT proceeding or matter any confidential facts or information which came into the possession of such Member or employee or to his or her attention by reason of his or her employment with the CAB or DOT without first applying for and obtaining the consent of the appropriate ethics counselor for the use of such facts or information.
          
          
            § 300.20
            Violations.
            (a) DOT may disqualify, and deny temporarily or permanently the privilege of appearing or practicing before it in any way to, any person who is found by DOT after written notice of charges and hearing to have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct. Any violation of this part shall be deemed to be such conduct.

            (b) When appropriate in the public interest, DOT may deny any application or other request of a party in a proceeding subject to this part where DOT finds after hearing that such party has, in connection with any DOT proceeding, violated any of the provisions of this part or any of the provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States Code. DOT may also condition its further consideration of such party's application or other request or the effectiveness of any order granting such application or other request upon such party's first taking such action as DOT may deem necessary or appropriate to remedy the violation of this part or Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States Code to prevent or deter any repetition of such violation. DOT may in addition issue a cease and desist order against any repetition of such or similar misconduct.
            (c) The actions authorized by this section may take place within the framework of the matter during or concerning which the violations occur or in a separate matter, as the DOT decisionmaker or the presiding administrative law judge may direct. A complaint alleging that a violation has occurred in the course of a matter shall be filed in the docket or appropriate public file of such matter unless such complaint is made after DOT's decision of the matter has become final, in which event such complaint may be filed pursuant to part 302, subpart D of the rules of practice. A violation in the course of a matter which may be attributable to or affect the fitness of a party will ordinarily either be disposed of within the framework of such matter or be considered within the context of any subsequent matter involving the interests of such party. Other violations will ordinarily be disposed of in a separate proceeding.
            (d) In the case of any violation of the provisions of this part, the violator may be subject to civil penalties under the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 46301. The violator may also be subject to a proceeding brought under 49 U.S.C. 46101 before the Department, or sections 46106 through 46108 of the Statute before a U.S. District Court, as the case may be, to compel compliance with civil penalties which have been imposed.

            (a) Applicability. This part governs the conduct of all aviation economic proceedings before the Department whether instituted by order of the Department or by the filing with the Department of an application, complaint, petition, motion, or other authorized or required document. This part also contains delegations to administrative law judges and to the DOT decisionmaker of the Department's function to render the agency decision in certain cases and the procedures for review of those decisions. This part applies unless otherwise specified by order of the Department.
            (b) Description. Subpart A of this part sets forth general rules applicable to all types of proceedings. Each of the other subparts of this part sets forth special rules applicable to the type of proceedings described in the title of the subpart. Therefore, for information as to applicable rules, reference should be made to subpart A and to the rules in the subpart relating to the particular type of proceeding, if any. In addition, reference should be made to Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation) (“the Statute”), and to the substantive rules, regulations and orders of the Department relating to the proceeding. Wherever there is any conflict between one of the general rules in subpart A and a special rule in another subpart applicable to a particular type of proceeding, the special rule will govern.
            (c) Reference to part and method of citing rules. This part may be referred to as the “Rules of Practice”. Each section, and any paragraph or subparagraph thereof, may be referred to as a “Rule”. The number of each rule need include only the numbers and letters at the right of the decimal point. For example, “302.7 Service of documents”, may be referred to as “Rule 7”.

              § 302.3
              Filing of documents.
              (a) Filing address, date of filing, hours. (1) Documents required by any section of this part to be filed with the Department must be filed with Department of Transportation Dockets at the Department's offices in Washington, DC. Documents may be filed either on paper or by electronic means using the process set at the DOT Dockets Management System (DMS) internet website.
              (2) Such documents will be deemed to be filed on the date on which they are actually received by the Department. Documents must be filed between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., eastern standard or daylight savings time, whichever is in effect in the District of Columbia at the time, Monday to Friday, inclusive, except on legal holidays. Electronic filings may be made at any time under the process set by the Department. Electronic filings that are received after the specified Dockets Facility hours shall be deemed to be constructively received on the next Dockets Facility business day.
              (b) Formal specifications of documents. (1) Documents filed under this part must be on white paper not larger than 81/2 by 11 inches, including any tables, charts and other documents that may be included. Ink must be black to provide substantial contrast for scanning and photographic reproduction. Text must be double-spaced (except for footnotes and long quotations which may be single-spaced) using type not smaller than 12 point. The left margin must be at least 11/2 inches; all other margins must be at least 1 inch. The title page and first page must bear a clear date and all subsequent pages must bear a page number and abbreviated heading.

              (2) Papers may be reproduced by any duplicating process, provided all copies are clear and legible. Appropriate notes or other indications must be used, so that the existence of any matters shown in color on the original will be accurately indicated on all copies.
              (c) Number of copies. Unless otherwise specified, an executed original, along with the number of true copies set forth below for each type of proceeding, must be filed with Department of Transportation Dockets. The copies filed need not be signed, but the name of the person signing the original document, as distinguished from the firm or organization he or she represents, must also be typed or printed on all copies below the space provided for signature. Electronic filers need only submit one copy of the document, which must conform to the submission requirements given in the electronic filing instructions at the specified DOT DMS internet website and in this part, as applicable.

              (2) If any document initiating, or filed in, a proceeding is not in substantial conformity with the applicable rules or regulations of the Department as to the contents thereof, or is otherwise insufficient, the Department, on its own initiative, or on motion of any party, may reject, strike or dismiss such document, or require its amendment.
              (e) Official docket copy.

I understand that an individual who is found to have violated the provisions of 18 U.S.C. section 1001 shall be fined or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.” In addition, electronic subscription requirements shall be those specified at the DOT DMS internet website.
            
            
              § 302.5
              Amendment of documents.
              (a) An application may be amended prior to the filing of answers thereto, or, if no answer is filed, prior to the issuance of an order establishing further procedures, disposing of the application, or setting the case for hearing. Thereafter, applications may be amended only if leave is granted pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 302.11.
              (b) Except as otherwise provided, if properly amended, a document and any statutory deadline shall be made effective as of the date of original filing but the time prescribed for the filing of an answer or any further responsive document directed towards the amended document shall be computed from the date of the filing of the amendment.
            
            
              § 302.6
              Responsive documents.
              (a) Answers. Answers to applications, complaints, petitions, motions or other documents or orders instituting proceedings may be filed by any person. In hearing cases, answers may be filed by any party to such proceedings or any person who has a petition for intervention pending. Except as otherwise provided, answers are not required.
              (b) Further responsive documents. Except as otherwise provided, a reply to an answer, reply to a reply, or any further responsive document is not authorized.
              (c) Motions for leave to file otherwise unauthorized documents. (1) The Department will accept otherwise unauthorized documents for filing only if leave has been obtained from the DOT decisionmaker or, if applicable, the administrative law judge, on written motion and for good cause shown.
              (2) Such motions shall contain a concise statement of the matters relied upon as good cause and shall be attached to the pleading or other document for which leave to file is sought, or the written motion may be incorporated into the otherwise unauthorized document for which admission is sought. In such event, the document filed shall be titled to describe both the motion and the underlying documents.
              (3) Where unauthorized responsive documents are not permitted, all new matter contained in an answer filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be deemed controverted.
              (d) Time for filing. Except as otherwise provided, an answer, motion, or other further responsive document shall be filed within seven (7) days after service of any document, order, or ruling to which the proposed filing is responsive and must be served on all parties to the proceeding.
            
            
              § 302.7
              Service of documents.
              (a) Who makes service—(1) The Department. Formal complaints, notices, orders, and similar documents issued by the Department will be served by the Department upon all parties to the proceeding.
              (2) The parties. Answers, petitions, motions, briefs, exceptions, notices, protests, or memoranda, or any other documents filed by any party or other person with the Department shall be served by such party or other person upon all parties to the proceeding in which it is filed; including, where applicable, all persons who have petitioned for intervention in, or consolidation of applications with, such proceeding. Proof of service shall accompany all documents when they are filed. The Department may require additional service of any document(s).
              (b) How service may be made. Service may be made by first class mail, express mail, priority mail, registered or certified mail, facsimile transmission, personal delivery, or by electronic mail. The Department may prescribe other means of service by order or notice. The means of service selected must be done in such manner so as to have the same attributes as section 46103 of the Statute, which provides for service of notices and processes in a proceeding by personal service or registered or certified mail.
              (c) Who may be served. Service upon a party or person may be made upon an individual, or upon a member of a partnership or firm to be served, or upon the president or other officer of the corporation, company, firm, or association to be served, or upon the assignee or legal successor of any of the foregoing, or upon any attorney of record for the party, or upon the agent designated by an air carrier or foreign air carrier under section 46103 of the Statute, but it shall be served upon a person designated by a party to receive service of documents in a particular proceeding in accordance with § 302.4(a)(2)(iv) once a proceeding has been commenced.
              (d) Where service may be made. Service shall be made at the principal place of business of the party to be served, or at his or her usual residence if he or she is an individual, or at the office of the party's attorney of record, or at the office or usual residence of the agent designated by an air carrier or foreign air carrier under section 46103 of the Statute, or at the post office or electronic address or facsimile number stated for a person designated to receive service pursuant to § 302.4(a)(2)(iv).
              (e) Proof of service. Proof of service of any document shall consist of one of the following:
              (1) A certificate of mailing executed by the person mailing the document.
              (2) A certificate of successful transmission executed by the person transmitting the document by facsimile or electronic mail, listing the facsimile numbers or electronic mail address to which the document was sent, and stating that no indication was received that any transmission had failed. In the event of an electronic transmission failure, any other authorized means of service may be substituted and the appropriate proof of service provided.
              (f) Date of service. The date of service by post office or electronic mail is the date of mailing. Whenever proof of service by personal delivery or facsimile transmission is made, the date of such delivery or facsimile transmission shall be the date of service.
              (g) Freely Associated State Proceedings. In any proceeding directly involving air transportation to the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, or Palau, the Department and any party or participant in the proceeding shall serve all documents on the President and the designated authorities of the government(s) involved. This requirement shall apply to all proceedings where service is otherwise required, and shall be in addition to any other service required by this chapter.
            
            
              § 302.8
              Computation of time.
              In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this part, by notice, order or regulation or by any applicable statute, the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday for the Department, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor holiday. When the period of time prescribed is seven (7) days or fewer, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays shall be excluded in the computation, unless otherwise specified by the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge assigned to the proceeding, as the case may be.
            
            
              § 302.9
              Continuances and extensions of time.
              (a) Whenever a party has the right or obligation to take action within a period prescribed by this part, by a notice given thereunder, or by an order or regulation, the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge assigned to the proceeding, as appropriate, may:
              (1) Before the expiration of the prescribed period, with or without notice, extend such period, or
              (2) Upon motion, permit the act to be done after the expiration of the specified period, where good cause for the failure to act on time is clearly shown.
              (b) Except where an administrative law judge has been assigned to a proceeding, requests for continuance or extensions of time, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, shall be directed to the DOT decisionmaker. Requests for continuances and extensions of time may be directed to the Chief Administrative Law Judge in the absence of the administrative law judge assigned to the proceeding.
            
            
              § 302.10
              Parties.

              (a) In addition to the persons set forth in § 302.2, in hearing cases, parties shall include Department staff designated to participate in the proceeding and any persons authorized to intervene or granted permission to participate in accordance with §§ 302.19 and 302.20. In any proceeding directly involving air transportation to the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands or Palau, these governments or their designated authorities shall be a party.
              (b) Upon motion and for good cause shown, the Department may order a substitution of parties, except that in case of the death of a party, substitution may be ordered without the filing of a motion.
              (c) An association composed entirely or in part of air carriers may participate in any proceedings of the Department to which the Department's procedural regulations apply if the association represents members that are identified in any documents filed with the Department, and that have specifically authorized the positions taken by the association in that proceeding. The specific authorizations may be informal and evidence of them shall be provided only upon request of the Department. Upon motion of any interested person or upon its own initiative, the Department may issue an order requiring an association to withdraw from a case on the grounds of significant divergence of interest or position within the association.
            
            
              § 302.11
              Motions.
              (a) Generally. An application to the DOT decisionmaker or an administrative law judge for an order or ruling not otherwise specifically provided for in this part shall be by motion. If an administrative law judge is assigned to a proceeding and before the issuance of a recommended or initial decision or the certification of the record to the DOT decisionmaker, all motions shall be addressed to the administrative law judge. At all other times, motions shall be addressed to the DOT decisionmaker. All motions shall be made at an appropriate time depending upon the nature thereof and the relief requested therein. This paragraph should not be construed as authorizing motions in the nature of petitions for reconsideration.
              (b) Form and contents. Unless made during a hearing, motions shall be made in writing in conformity with §§ 302.3 and 302.4, shall state their grounds and the relief or order sought, and shall be accompanied by any affidavits or other evidence desired to be relied upon. Motions made during hearings, answers to them, and rulings on them, may be made orally on the record unless the administrative law judge directs otherwise. Written motions shall be filed as separate documents, and shall not be incorporated in any other documents, except where incorporation of a motion in another document is specifically authorized by the Department, or where a document is filed that requests alternative forms of relief and one of these alternative requests is properly to be made by motion. In these instances the document filed shall be appropriately titled and identified to indicate that it incorporates a motion; otherwise, the motion will be disregarded.
              (c) Answers to motions. Within seven (7) days after a motion is served, or such other period as the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge may fix, any party to the proceeding may file an answer in support of or in opposition to the motion, accompanied by such affidavits or other evidence as it desires to rely upon. Except as otherwise provided, no reply to an answer, reply to a reply, or any further responsive document shall be filed.
              (d) Oral arguments; briefs. No oral argument will be heard on motions unless the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge otherwise directs. Written memoranda or briefs may be filed with motions or answers to motions, stating the points and authorities relied upon in support of the position taken.
              (e) Requests for expedition. Any interested person may by motion request expedition of any proceeding or file an answer in support of or in opposition to such motions.
              (f) Effect of pendency of motions. The filing or pendency of a motion shall not automatically alter or extend the time to take action fixed by this part or by any order of the Department or of an administrative law judge (or any extension granted thereunder).
              
              (g) Disposition of motions. The DOT decisionmaker shall pass upon all motions properly submitted to him or her for decision. The administrative law judge shall pass upon all motions properly addressed to him or her, except that, if the administrative law judge finds that a prompt decision by the DOT decisionmaker on a motion is essential to the proper conduct of the proceeding, the administrative law judge may refer such motion to the DOT decisionmaker for decision.
              (h) Appeals to the DOT decisionmaker from rulings of administrative law judges. Rulings of administrative law judges on motions may not be appealed to the DOT decisionmaker prior to his or her consideration of the entire proceeding except in extraordinary circumstances and with the consent of the administrative law judge. An appeal shall be disallowed unless the administrative law judge finds, either on the record or in writing, that the allowance of such an appeal is necessary to prevent substantial detriment to the public interest or undue prejudice to any party. If an appeal is allowed, any party may file a brief with the DOT decisionmaker within such period as the administrative law judge directs. No oral argument will be heard unless the DOT decisionmaker directs otherwise. The rulings of the administrative law judge on a motion may be reviewed by the DOT decisionmaker in connection with his or her final action in the proceeding or at any other appropriate time irrespective of the filing of an appeal or any action taken on it.
            
            
              § 302.12
              Objections to public disclosure of information.
              (a) Generally. Part 7 of the Office of the Secretary regulations, Public Availability of Information, governs the availability of records and documents of the Department to the public. (49 CFR 7.1 et seq.)
              (b) Information contained in written documents. Any person who objects to the public disclosure of any information filed in any proceeding, or pursuant to the provisions of the Statute, or any Department rule, regulation, or order, shall segregate, or request the segregation of, such information into a separate submission and shall file it separately in a sealed envelope, bearing the caption of the enclosed submission, and the notation “Confidential Treatment Requested Under § 302.12.” At the time of filing such submission (or, when the objection is made by a person who is not the filer, within five (5) days after the filing of such submission), the objecting party shall file a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure, in accordance with the procedure outlined in paragraph (d) or (f) of this section, as appropriate. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, copies of the filed submission and of the motion need not be served upon any other party unless so ordered by the Department.
              (c) Information contained in oral testimony. Any person who objects to the public disclosure of any information sought to be elicited from a witness or deponent on oral examination shall, before such information is disclosed, make his or her objection known. Upon such objection duly made, the witness or deponent shall be compelled to disclose such information only in the presence of the administrative law judge or the person before whom the deposition is being taken, as the case may be, the official stenographer and such attorneys for and representative of each party as the administrative law judge or the person before whom the deposition is being taken shall designate, and after all present have been sworn to secrecy. The transcript of testimony containing such information shall be segregated and filed in a sealed envelope, bearing the title and docket number of the proceeding, and the notation “Confidential Treatment Requested Under § 302.12 Testimony Given by (name of witness or deponent).” Within five (5) days after such testimony is given, the objecting person shall file a motion in accordance with the procedure outlined in paragraph (d) of this section, to withhold the information from public disclosure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, copies of the segregated portion of the transcript and of the motion need not be served upon any other party unless so ordered by the Department.
              
              (d) Form of motion. Motions to withhold from public disclosure information covered by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be filed with the Department in accordance with the following procedure:
              (1) The motion shall include:
              (i) An index listing the information or document sought to be withheld by an identifying number, and including its title, description and number of pages, and, if relevant, the specific location within a document;
              (ii) A statement explaining how and why the information falls within one or more of the exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9)); and
              (iii) A statement explaining how and why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the interests of the objecting persons and is not required in the interest of the public.
              (2) Such motion shall be filed with the person conducting the proceeding, or with the person with whom said application, report, or submission is required to be filed. Such motion will be denied when the complete justification required by this paragraph is not provided.
              (3) During the pendency of such motion, the ruling official may, by notice or order, allow limited disclosure to parties' representatives, for purposes of participating in the proceeding, upon submission by them of affidavits swearing to protect the confidentiality of the documents at issue.
              (e) Conditions of disclosure. The order, notice or other action of the Department containing its ruling upon each such motion will specify the extent to which, and the conditions upon which, the information may be disclosed to the parties and to the public, which ruling shall become effective upon the date stated therein, unless, within five (5) days after the date of the entry of the Department's order with respect thereto, a petition is filed by the objecting person requesting reconsideration by the Department, or a written statement is filed indicating that the objecting person in good faith intends to seek judicial review of the Department's order.
              (f) Objection by Government departments or representative thereof. In the case of objection to the public disclosure of any information filed by or elicited from any United States Government department or agency, or representative thereof, under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the department or agency making such objection shall be exempted from the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section insofar as said paragraphs require the filing of a written objection to such disclosure. However, any department, agency, or representative thereof may, if it so desires, file a memorandum setting forth the reasons why it is claimed that a public disclosure of the information should not be made. If such a memorandum is submitted, it shall be filed and handled as is provided by this section in the case of a motion to withhold information from public disclosure.
            
            
              § 302.13
              Consolidation of proceedings.
              (a) Initiation of consolidations. The Department, upon its own initiative or upon motion, may consolidate for hearing or for other purposes or may contemporaneously consider two or more proceedings that involve substantially the same parties, or issues that are the same or closely related, if it finds that such consolidation or contemporaneous consideration will be conducive to the proper dispatch of its business and to the ends of justice and will not unduly delay the proceedings. Although the Department may, in any particular case, consolidate or contemporaneously consider two or more proceedings on its own motion, the burden of seeking consolidation or contemporaneous consideration of a particular application shall rest upon the applicant and the Department will not undertake to search its docket for all applications that might be consolidated or contemporaneously considered.
              (b) Time for filing. Unless the Department has provided otherwise in a particular proceeding, a motion to consolidate or contemporaneously consider an application with any other application shall be filed within 21 days of the original application in the case of international route awards under section 41102 of the Statute (see § 302.212), or, where a proceeding has been set for hearing before an administrative law judge, not later than the prehearing conference in the proceeding with which consolidation or contemporaneous consideration is requested. If made at such conference, the motion may be oral. All motions for consolidation or consideration of issues that enlarge, expand, or otherwise change the nature of the proceeding shall be addressed to the DOT decisionmaker, unless made orally at the prehearing conference, in which event the presiding administrative law judge shall present such motion to the DOT decisionmaker for his or her decision. A motion that is not timely filed, or that does not relate to an application pending at such time, shall be dismissed unless the movant shall clearly show good cause for failure to file such motion or application on time.
              (c) Answer. If a motion to consolidate two or more proceedings is filed with the Department, any party to any of such proceedings, or any person who has a petition for intervention pending, may file an answer to such motion within such period as the DOT decisionmaker may permit. The administrative law judge may require that answers to such motions be stated orally at the prehearing conference in the proceeding with which the consolidation is proposed.
            
            
              § 302.14
              Petitions for reconsideration.
              (a) Department orders subject to reconsideration; time for filing. (1) Unless an order or a rule of the Department specifically provides otherwise:
              (i) Any interested person may file a petition for reconsideration of any interlocutory order issued by the Department that institutes a proceeding; and

              (ii) Any party to a proceeding may file a petition for reconsideration, rehearing, or reargument of final orders issued by the Department (See § 302.38), or an interlocutory order that defines the scope and issues of a proceeding or suspends a provision of a tariff on file with the Department.
              (2) Unless otherwise provided, petitions for reconsideration shall be filed, in the case of a final order, within twenty (20) days after service thereof, and, in the case of an interlocutory order, within ten (10) days after service. However, neither the filing nor the granting of such a petition shall operate as a stay of such final or interlocutory order unless specifically so ordered by the DOT decisionmaker. Within ten (10) days after a petition for reconsideration, rehearing, or reargument is filed, any party to the proceeding may file an answer in support of or in opposition. Motions for extension of time to file a petition or answer, and for leave to file a petition or answer after the time for the filing has expired, will not be granted except on a showing of unusual and exceptional circumstances, constituting good cause for the movant's inability to meet the established procedural dates.
              (b) Contents of petition. A petition for reconsideration, rehearing, or reargument shall state, briefly and specifically, the matters of record alleged to have been erroneously decided, the ground relied upon, and the relief sought. If a decision by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary is requested, the petition should describe in detail the reasons for such request and specify any important national transportation policy issues that are presented. If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on allegations as to the consequences that would result from the final order, the basis of such allegations shall be set forth. If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on new matter, such new matter shall be set forth, accompanied by a statement to the effect that petitioner, with due diligence, could not have known or discovered such new matter prior to the date the case was submitted for decision. Unless otherwise directed by the DOT decisionmaker upon a showing of unusual or exceptional circumstances, petitions for reconsideration, rehearing or reargument or answers thereto that exceed twenty-five (25) pages (including appendices) in length shall not be accepted for filing by Department of Transportation Dockets.
              (c) Successive petitions. A successive petition for rehearing, reargument, reconsideration filed by the same party or person, and upon substantially the same ground as a former petition that has been considered or denied will not be entertained.
            
            
              
              Non-Hearing Proceedings
              
                § 302.15
                Non-hearing procedures.
                In cases where oral evidentiary hearing procedures will not be used, § 302.17 through § 302.37, relating to hearing procedures, shall not be applicable except to the extent that the DOT decisionmaker shall determine that the application of some or all of such rules in the particular case will be conducive to the proper dispatch of its business and to the public interest. References in these and other sections of this part to powers or actions by administrative law judges shall not apply.
              
            
            
              Rulemaking Proceedings
              
                § 302.16
                Petitions for rulemaking.

                Any interested person may petition the Department for the issuance, amendment, modification, or repeal of any regulation, subject to the provisions of part 5, Rulemaking Procedures, of the Office of the Secretary regulations (49 CFR 5.1 et seq.).
              
            
            
              Oral Evidentiary Hearing Proceedings
              
                § 302.17
                Administrative law judges.
                (a) Powers and delegation of authority. (1) An administrative law judge shall have the following powers, in addition to any others specified in this part:
                (i) To give notice concerning and to hold hearings;
                (ii) To administer oaths and affirmations;
                (iii) To examine witnesses;
                (iv) To issue subpoenas and to take or cause depositions to be taken;
                (v) To rule upon offers of proof and to receive relevant evidence;
                (vi) To regulate the course and conduct of the hearing;
                (vii) To hold conferences before or during the hearing for the settlement or simplification of issues;
                (viii) To rule on motions and to dispose of procedural requests or similar matters;
                (ix) To make initial or recommended decisions as provided in § 302.31;
                (x) To take any other action authorized by this part or by the Statute.
                (2) The administrative law judge shall have the power to take any other action authorized by part 385 of this chapter or by the Administrative Procedure Act.
                (3) The administrative law judge assigned to a particular case is delegated the DOT decisionmaker's function of making the agency decision on the substantive and procedural issues remaining for disposition at the close of the hearing in such case, except that this delegation does not apply in cases where the record is certified to the DOT decisionmaker, with or without an initial or recommended decision by the administrative law judge, or in cases requiring Presidential approval under section 41307 of the Statute. This delegation does not apply to the review of rulings by the administrative law judge on interlocutory matters that have been appealed to the DOT decisionmaker in accordance with the requirements of § 302.11.
                (4) The administrative law judge's authority in each case will terminate either upon the certification of the record in the proceeding to the DOT decisionmaker, or upon the issuance of an initial or recommended decision, or when he or she shall have withdrawn from the case upon considering himself or herself disqualified.
                (b) Disqualification. An administrative law judge shall withdraw from the case if at any time he or she deems himself or herself disqualified. If, prior to the initial or recommended decision in the case, there is filed with the administrative law judge, in good faith, an affidavit of personal bias or disqualification with substantiating facts and the administrative law judge does not withdraw, the DOT decisionmaker shall determine the matter, if properly presented by exception or brief, as a part of the record and decision in the case. The DOT decisionmaker shall not otherwise consider any claim of bias or disqualification. The DOT decisionmaker, in his or her discretion, may order a hearing on a charge of bias or disqualification.
              
              
                § 302.18
                DOT decisionmaker.
                (a) Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs is the DOT decisionmaker. The Assistant Secretary shall have all of the powers set forth in § 302.17(a)(1) and those additional powers delegated by the Secretary. The Assistant Secretary may delegate this authority in appropriate non-hearing cases to subordinate officials.
                (b) Oral hearing cases assigned to the senior career official. Carrier selection proceedings for international route authority that are set for oral hearing and such other oral hearing cases as the Secretary deems appropriate will be assigned to the senior career official in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, who will serve as the DOT decisionmaker. In all such cases, the administrative law judge shall render a recommended decision to the senior career official, who shall have all of the powers set forth in § 302.17(a)(1) and those additional powers delegated by the Secretary.
                (1) Decisions of the senior career official are subject to review by, and at the discretion of, the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs. Petitions for discretionary review of decisions of the senior career official will not be entertained. A notice of review by the Assistant Secretary will establish the procedures for review. Unless a notice of review is issued, the decision of the senior career official will be issued as a final decision of the Department and will be served fourteen (14) days after it is adopted by the senior career official.
                (2) Final decisions of the senior career official may be reviewed upon a petition for reconsideration filed pursuant to § 302.14. Such a petition shall state clearly the basis for requesting reconsideration and shall specify any questions of national transportation policy that may be involved. The Assistant Secretary will either grant or deny the petition.
                (3) Upon review or reconsideration, the Assistant Secretary may either affirm the decision or remand the decision to the senior career official for further action consistent with such order of remand.
                (4) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, final decisions of the senior career official will be transmitted to the President of the United States when required under 49 U.S.C. 41307.
                (c) Secretary and Deputy Secretary. The Secretary or Deputy Secretary may exercise any authority of the Assistant Secretary whenever he or she believes a decision involves important questions of national transportation policy.
              
              
                § 302.19
                Participation by persons not parties.
                Any person, including any State, subdivision thereof, State aviation commission, or other public body, may appear at any hearing, other than in an enforcement proceeding, and present any evidence that is relevant to the issues. With the consent of the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, such person may also cross-examine witnesses directly. Such persons may also present to the administrative law judge a written statement on the issues involved in the proceeding. Such written statements shall be filed and served on all parties prior to the close of the hearing.
              
              
                § 302.20
                Formal intervention.
                (a) Who may intervene. Any person who has a statutory right to be made a party to an oral evidentiary hearing proceeding shall be permitted to intervene. Any person whose intervention will be conducive to the public interest and will not unduly delay the conduct of such proceeding may be permitted to intervene.
                (b) Considerations relevant to determination of petition to intervene. In passing upon a petition to intervene, the following factors, among other things, will be considered and will be liberally interpreted to facilitate the effective participation by members of the public in Department proceedings:
                (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the statute to be made a party to the proceeding;
                (2) The nature and extent of the property, financial or other interest of the petitioner;

                (3) The effect of the order that may be entered in the proceeding on petitioner's interest;
                
                (4) The availability of other means whereby the petitioner's interest may be protected;
                (5) The extent to which petitioner's interest will be represented by existing parties;
                (6) The extent to which petitioner's participation may reasonably be expected to assist in the development of a sound record; and
                (7) The extent to which participation of the petitioner will broaden the issues or delay the proceeding.
                (c) Petition to intervene—(1) Contents. Any person desiring to intervene in a proceeding shall file a petition in conformity with this part setting forth the facts and reasons why he or she thinks he or she should be permitted to intervene. The petition should make specific reference to the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
                (2) Time for filing. Unless otherwise ordered by the Department:
                (i) A petition to intervene shall be filed with the Department prior to the first prehearing conference, or, in the event that no such conference is to be held, not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing.
                (ii) A petition to intervene filed by a city, other public body, or a chamber of commerce shall be filed with the Department not later than the last day prior to the beginning of the hearing.
                (iii) A petition to intervene that is not timely filed shall be dismissed unless the petitioner shall clearly show good cause for his or her failure to file such petition on time.
                (3) Answer. Any party to a proceeding may file an answer to a petition to intervene, making specific reference to the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, within seven (7) days after the petition is filed.
                (4) Disposition. The decision granting, denying or otherwise ruling on any petition to intervene may be issued without receiving testimony or oral argument either from the petitioner or other parties to the proceeding.
                (d) Effect of granting intervention. A person permitted to intervene in a proceeding thereby becomes a party to the proceeding. However, interventions provided for in this section are for administrative purposes only, and no decision granting leave to intervene shall be deemed to constitute an expression by the Department that the intervening party has such a substantial interest in the order that is to be entered in the proceeding as will entitle it to judicial review of such order.
              
              
                § 302.21
                Appearances.
                (a) Any party to a proceeding may appear and be heard in person or by a designated representative.
                (b) No register of persons who may practice before the Department is maintained and no application for admission to practice is required.
                (c) Any person practicing or desiring to practice before the Department may, upon hearing and good cause shown, be suspended or barred from practicing.
              
              
                § 302.22
                Prehearing conference.
                (a) Purpose and scope of conference. At the discretion of the administrative law judge, a prehearing conference may be called prior to any hearing. Written notice of the prehearing conference shall be sent by the administrative law judge to all parties to a proceeding and to other persons who appear to have an interest in such proceeding. The purpose of such a conference is to define the issues and the scope of the proceeding, to secure statements of the positions of the parties and amendments to the pleadings, to schedule the exchange of exhibits before the date set for hearing, and to arrive at such agreements as will aid in the conduct and disposition of the proceeding. For example, consideration will be given to:
                (1) Matters that the DOT decisionmaker can consider without the necessity of proof;
                (2) Admissions of fact and of the genuineness of documents;
                (3) Requests for documents;
                (4) Admissibility of evidence;
                (5) Limitation of the number of witnesses;
                (6) Reducing of oral testimony to exhibit form;
                (7) Procedure at the hearing; and

                (8) Use of electronic media as a basis for exchange of briefs, hearing transcripts and exhibits, etc., in addition to the official record copy.
                
                (b) Actions during prehearing conference. The administrative law judge may require a further conference, or responsive pleadings, or both. If a party refuses to produce documents requested by another party at the conference, the administrative law judge may compel the production of such documents prior to a hearing by subpoena issued in accordance with the provisions of § 302.25 as though at a hearing. Applications for the production prior to hearing of documents in the Department's possession shall be addressed to the administrative law judge, in accordance with the provisions of § 302.25(g), in the same manner as provided therein for production of documents at a hearing. The administrative law judge may also, on his or her own initiative or on motion of any party, direct any party to the proceeding (air carrier or non-air carrier) to prepare and submit exhibits setting forth studies, forecasts, or estimates on matters relevant to the issues in the proceeding.
                (c) Report of prehearing conference. The administrative law judge shall issue a report of prehearing conference, defining the issues, giving an account of the results of the conference, specifying a schedule for the exchange of exhibits and rebuttal exhibits, the date of hearing, and specifying a time for the filing of objections to such report. The report shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding and any person who appeared at the conference. Objections to the report may be filed by any interested person within the time specified therein. The administrative law judge may revise his or her report in the light of the objections presented. The revised report, if any, shall be served upon the same persons as was the original report. Exceptions may be taken on the basis of any timely written objection that has not been met by a revision of the report if the exceptions are filed within the time specified in the revised report. Such report shall constitute the official account of the conference and shall control the subsequent course of the proceeding, but it may be reconsidered and modified at any time to protect the public interest or to prevent injustice.
              
              
                § 302.23
                Hearing.
                The administrative law judge to whom the case is assigned or the DOT decisionmaker shall give the parties reasonable notice of a hearing or of the change in the date and place of a hearing and the nature of such hearing.
              
              
                § 302.24
                Evidence.
                (a) Presenting evidence. Presenting evidence at the hearing shall be limited to material evidence relevant to the issues as drawn by the pleadings or as defined in the report of prehearing conference, subject to such later modifications of the issues as may be necessary to protect the public interest or to prevent injustice, and shall not be unduly repetitious. Evidence shall be presented in such form by all parties as the administrative law judge may direct.
                (b) Objections to evidence. Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objections relied upon, and the transcript shall not include argument or debate except as ordered by the administrative law judge. Rulings on such objections shall be a part of the transcript.
                (c) Exhibits. When exhibits are offered in evidence, one copy must be furnished to each of the parties at the hearing, and two copies to the administrative law judge, unless the parties previously have been furnished with copies or the administrative law judge directs otherwise. If the administrative law judge has not fixed a time for the exchange of exhibits, the parties shall exchange copies of exhibits at the earliest practicable time, preferably before the hearing or, at the latest, at the commencement of the hearing. Copies of exhibits may, at the discretion of the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, be furnished by use of electronic media in lieu of or in addition to a paper record copy.
                (d) Substitution of copies for original exhibits. In his or her discretion, the administrative law judge may permit a party to withdraw original documents offered in evidence and substitute true copies in lieu thereof.
                
                (e) Designation of parts of documents. When relevant and material matter offered in evidence by any party is embraced in a book, paper, or document containing other matter not material or relevant, the party offering the same shall plainly designate the matter so offered. The immaterial and irrelevant parts shall be excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable. If the volume of immaterial or irrelevant matter would unduly encumber the record, such submission will not be received in evidence, but may be marked for identification, and, if properly authenticated, the relevant or material matter may be read into the record, or, if the administrative law judge so directs, a true copy of such matter, in proper form, shall be received as an exhibit, and like copies delivered by the party offering the same to opposing parties or their attorneys appearing at the hearing, who shall be afforded an opportunity to examine the submission, and to offer in evidence in like manner other portions of the exhibit.
                (f) Records in other proceedings. In case any portion of the record in any other proceeding or civil or criminal action is offered in evidence, a true copy of such portion shall be presented for the record in the form of an exhibit unless:
                (1) The portion is specified with particularity in such manner as to be readily identified;
                (2) The party offering the same agrees unconditionally to supply such copies later, or when required by the DOT decisionmaker;
                (3) The parties represented at the hearing stipulate upon the record that such portion may be incorporated by reference, and that any portion offered by any other party may be incorporated by like reference upon compliance with paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section; and
                (4) The administrative law judge directs such incorporation or waives the requirement in paragraph (f)(3) of this section with the consent of the parties.
                (g) Official notice of facts contained in certain documents. (1) Without limiting, in any manner or to any extent, the discretionary powers of the DOT decisionmaker and the administrative law judge to notice other matters or documents properly the subject of official notice, facts contained in any document within the categories enumerated in this subdivision are officially noticed in all formal economic proceedings except those subject to subpart D of this part. Each such category shall include any document antedating the final Department decision in the proceeding where such notice is taken.

However, such taking of official notice shall be subject to the rights granted to any party or intervener to the proceeding under section 7(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 557(d)).
                (3) The decisions of the Department and its administrative law judges may officially notice any appropriate matter without regard to whether or not such items are contained in a document belonging to the categories enumerated in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. However, where the decision rests on official notice of a material fact or facts, it will set forth such items with sufficient particularity to advise interested persons of the matters that have been noticed.
                (h) Receipt of documents after hearing. No document or other writings shall be accepted for the record after the close of the hearing except in accordance with an agreement of the parties and the consent of the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker.
                (i) Exceptions. Formal exceptions to the rulings of the administrative law judge made during the course of the hearing are unnecessary. For all purposes for which an exception otherwise would be taken, it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling of the administrative law judge is made or sought, makes known the action he or she desires the administrative law judge to take or his or her objection to an action taken, and his or her grounds therefor.
                (j) Offers of proof.

                § 302.25
                Subpoenas.
                (a) An application for a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a hearing or the production of documentary evidence may be made without notice by any party to the administrative law judge or, in the event that an administrative law judge has not been assigned to a proceeding or is not available, to the DOT decisionmaker or the Chief Administrative Law Judge, for action.

                (b) An application for a subpoena shall be in duplicate except that if it is made during the course of a hearing, it may be made orally on the record with the consent of the administrative law judge.
                (c) All such applications, whether written or oral, shall contain a statement or showing of general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought, and shall be accompanied by two copies of a draft of the subpoena sought that, in the case of evidence, shall describe the documentary or tangible evidence to be subpoenaed with as much particularity as is feasible, or, in the case of a witness, the name of the witness and a general description of the matters concerning which the witness will be asked to testify.
                (d) The administrative law judge or DOT decisionmaker considering any application for a subpoena shall issue the subpoena requested if the application complies with this section. No attempt shall be made to determine the admissibility of evidence in passing upon an application for a subpoena, and no detailed or burdensome showing shall be required as a condition to the issuance of a subpoena.
                (e) Where it appears during the course of a proceeding that the testimony of a witness or documentary evidence is relevant to the issues in a proceeding, the administrative law judge, Chief Administrative Law Judge or DOT decisionmaker may issue on his or her own initiative a subpoena requiring such witness to attend and testify or requiring the production of such documentary evidence.
                (f) Subpoenas issued under this section shall be served upon the person to whom directed in accordance with § 302.7(b). Any person upon whom a subpoena is served may within seven (7) days after service or at any time prior to the return date thereof, whichever is earlier, file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena with the administrative law judge or, in the event an administrative law judge has not been assigned to a proceeding or is not available, to the DOT decisionmaker or the Chief Administrative Law Judge for action. If the person to whom the motion to modify or quash the subpoena has been addressed or directed, has not acted upon such a motion by the return date, such date shall be stayed pending his or her final action thereon. The DOT decisionmaker may at any time review, upon his or her own initiative, the ruling of an administrative law judge or the Chief Administrative Law Judge denying a motion to quash a subpoena. In such cases, the DOT decisionmaker may order that the return date of a subpoena be stayed pending action thereon.
                (g) The provisions of this section are not applicable to the attendance of DOT employees or the production of documentary evidence in the custody thereof at a hearing. The attendance of DOT employees and the production of documentary evidence in their custody are governed by 49 CFR Parts 9 and 7, respectively.
              
              
                § 302.26
                Depositions.
                (a) For good cause shown, the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge assigned to a proceeding may order that the testimony of a witness be taken by deposition and that the witness produce documentary evidence in connection with such testimony. Ordinarily an order to take the deposition of a witness will be entered only if:
                (1) The person whose deposition is to be taken would be unavailable at the hearing,
                (2) The deposition is deemed necessary to perpetuate the testimony of the witness, or
                (3) The taking of the deposition is necessary to prevent undue and excessive expense to a party and will not result in an undue burden to other parties or in undue delay.

                (b) Any party desiring to take the deposition of a witness shall make application therefor in duplicate to the administrative law judge or, in the event that an administrative law judge has not been assigned to a proceeding or is not available, to the DOT decisionmaker or Chief Administrative Law Judge, setting forth the reasons why such deposition should be taken, the name and residence of the witness, the time and place proposed for the taking of the deposition, and a general description of the matters concerning which the witness will be asked to testify. If good cause be shown, the administrative law judge, the DOT decisionmaker, or the Chief Administrative Law Judge, as the case may be, may, in his or her discretion, issue an order authorizing such deposition and specifying the witness whose deposition is to be taken, the general scope of the testimony to be taken, the time when, the place where, the designated officer (authorized to take oaths) before whom the witness is to testify, and the number of copies of the deposition to be supplied. Such order shall be served upon all parties by the person proposing to take the deposition a reasonable period in advance of the time fixed for taking testimony.
                (c) Witnesses whose testimony is taken by deposition shall be sworn or shall affirm before any questions are put to them. Each question shall be recorded and the answers shall be taken down in the words of the witness.
                (d) Objections to questions or evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objection relied upon, but no transcript filed by the designated officer shall include argument or debate. Objections to questions or evidence shall be noted by the designated officer upon the deposition, but he or she shall not have power to decide on the competency or materiality or relevance of evidence, and he or she shall record the evidence subject to objection. Objections to questions or evidence not made before the designated officer shall not be deemed waived unless the ground of the objection is one that might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.
                (e) The testimony shall be reduced to writing by the designated officer, or under his or her direction, after which the deposition shall be signed by the witness unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the witness is ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign, and certified in usual form by the designated officer. If the deposition is not signed by the witness, the designated officer shall state on the record this fact and the reason therefor. The original deposition and exhibits shall be forwarded to Department of Transportation Dockets and shall be filed in the proceedings.
                (f) Depositions may also be taken and submitted on written interrogatories in substantially the same manner as depositions taken by oral examination. Ordinarily such procedure will be authorized only if necessary to achieve the purposes of an oral deposition and to serve the balance of convenience of the parties. The interrogatories shall be filed in quadruplicate with two copies of the application and a copy of each shall be served on each party. Within seven (7) days after service any party may file with the person to whom application was made two copies of his or her objections, if any, to such interrogatories and may file such cross-interrogatories as he or she desires to submit. Cross-interrogatories shall be filed in quadruplicate, and a copy thereof together with a copy of any objections to interrogatories, shall be served on each party, who shall have five (5) days thereafter to file and serve his or her objections, if any, to such cross-interrogatories. Objections to interrogatories or cross-interrogatories, shall be served on the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge considering the application. Objections to interrogatories shall be made before the order for taking the deposition issues and if not so made shall be deemed waived. When a deposition is taken upon written interrogatories, and cross-interrogatories, no party shall be present or represented, and no person other than the witness, a reporter, and the designated officer shall be present at the examination of the witness, which fact shall be certified by the designated officer, who shall ask the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories to the witness in their order and reduce the testimony to writing in the witness's own words. The provisions of paragraph (e) of this section shall be applicable to depositions taken in accordance with this paragraph.

                (g) All depositions shall conform to the specifications of § 302.3 except that the filing of three copies thereof shall be sufficient. Any fees of a witness, the reporter, or the officer designated to take the deposition shall be paid by the person at whose instance the deposition is taken.
                
                (h) The fact that a deposition is taken and filed in a proceeding as provided in this section does not constitute a determination that it is admissible in evidence or that it may be used in the proceeding. Only such part or the whole of a deposition as is received in evidence shall constitute a part of the record in such proceeding upon which a decision may be based.
              
              
                § 302.27
                Rights of witnesses; attendance fees and mileage.
                (a) Any person appearing as a witness in any proceeding governed by this part, whether in response to a subpoena or by request or permission of the Department, may be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel and may be examined by that counsel after other questioning.
                (b) Any person who submits data or evidence in a proceeding governed by this part, whether in response to a subpoena or by request or permission of the Department, may retain, or, on payment of lawfully prescribed costs, procure, a copy of any document so submitted or a copy of any transcript made of such testimony.

                (c) No person whose attendance at a hearing or whose deposition is to be taken shall be obliged to respond to a subpoena unless upon a service of the subpoena he or she is tendered attendance fees and mileage by the party at whose instance he or she is called in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section; Provided, That a witness summoned at the instance of the Department or one of its employees, or a salaried employee of the United States summoned to testify as to matters related to his or her public employment, need not be tendered such fees or mileage at that time.

                (1) Witnesses who are not salaried employees of the United States, or such employees summoned to testify on matters not related to their public employment, shall be paid the same per diem, subsistence, and mileage fees paid to witnesses for like service in the courts of the United States that are in effect at the time of travel; Provided, That no employee, officer, or attorney of an air carrier who travels under the free or reduced rate provisions of section 41511 of the Statute shall be entitled to any fees or mileage; And provided further, That such fees and mileage shall not be applicable for witnesses summoned to testify in Alaska, and that, in Alaska, where permitted by section 41511 of the Statute, the witness may, at his or her option, accept a pass for travel by air. Such witnesses shall be furnished appropriate forms and instructions for the submission of claims for attendance fees, subsistence, and mileage from the Government before the close of the proceedings that they are required to attend. Only persons summoned by subpoena shall be entitled to claim attendance fees, subsistence, or mileage from the Government.
                (2) Witnesses who are salaried employees of the United States and who are summoned to testify on matters relating to their public employment, irrespective of at whose instance they are summoned, shall be paid in accordance with applicable Government regulations.
              
              
                § 302.28
                Transcripts of hearings.
                (a) Hearings shall be recorded and transcribed under supervision of the administrative law judge, by a reporting firm under contract with the Department. Copies of the transcript that may, at the discretion of the administrative law judge, be furnished by use of electronic media in addition to the official copy, shall be supplied to the parties to the proceeding by said reporting firm, at the contract price for copies.

                (b) The administrative law judge shall determine whether “ordinary transcript” or “daily transcript” (as those terms are defined in the contract) will be necessary and required for the proper conduct of the proceeding and the Department will pay the reporting firm the cost of reporting its proceedings at the contract price for such type of transcript. If the administrative law judge has determined that ordinary transcript is adequate, and has notified the parties of such determination (in the notice of hearings, or otherwise), then any party may request reconsideration of such determination and that daily transcript be required. In determining what is necessary and required for the proper conduct of the proceeding, the administrative law judge shall consider, among other things:
                (1) The nature of the proceeding itself;
                (2) The DOT decisionmaker's needs as well as the reasonable needs of the parties;
                (3) The cost to the Department; and
                (4) The requirements of a fair hearing.
                (c) If the administrative law judge has determined that ordinary transcript is adequate, or, upon reconsideration, has adhered to such determination, then any party may request the reporting firm to provide daily transcript. In that case, pursuant to its contract with the Department, the reporting firm will be obligated to furnish to the Department daily transcript upon the agreement by the requesting party to pay to the reporting firm an amount equal to the difference between the contract prices for ordinary transcript and daily transcript, provided that the requesting party makes such agreement with the reporting firm at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the date for which such transcript is requested.
                (d) Any party may obtain from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration, the name and address of the private reporting company with which the Department currently has a contract for transcripts and copies, as well as the contract prices then in effect for such services.
                (e) Copies of transcripts ordered by parties other than the Department shall be prepared for delivery to the requesting person at the reporting firm's place of business, within the stated time for the type of transcript ordered. The requesting party and the reporting firm may agree upon some other form or means of delivery (mail, messenger, electronic media, etc.) and the reporting firm may charge for such special service, provided that such charge shall not exceed the reasonable cost of such service.
                (f) Changes in the official transcript may be made only when they involve errors affecting substance. A motion to correct a transcript shall be filed with Department of Transportation Dockets, within ten (10) days after receipt of the completed transcript by the Department. If no objections to the motion are filed within ten (10) days thereafter, the transcript may, upon the approval of the administrative law judge, be changed to reflect such corrections. If objections are received, the motion and objections shall be submitted to the official reporter by the administrative law judge together with a request for a comparison of the transcript with the reporter's record of the hearing. After receipt of the report of the official reporter an order shall be entered by the administrative law judge settling the record and ruling on the motion.
              
              
                § 302.29
                Argument before the administrative law judge.
                (a) The administrative law judge shall give the parties to the proceeding adequate opportunity during the course of the hearing for the presentation of arguments in support of or in opposition to motions, and objections and exceptions to rulings of the administrative law judge.
                (b) When, in the opinion of the administrative law judge, the volume of the evidence or the importance or complexity of the issues involved warrants, he or she may, either on his or her own motion or at the request of a party, permit the presentation of oral argument, and may impose such time limits on the argument as he or she may determine appropriate. Such argument shall be transcribed and bound with the transcript of testimony and will be available to the Department decisionmaker for consideration in deciding the case.
              
              
                § 302.30
                Briefs to the administrative law judge.
                Within such limited time after the close of the reception of evidence fixed by the administrative law judge, any party may, upon request and under such conditions as the administrative law judge may prescribe, file for his or her consideration briefs which may include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law that shall contain exact references to the record and authorities relied upon.
              
              
                
                § 302.31
                Initial and recommended decisions; certification of the record.
                (a) Action by administrative law judge after hearing. Except where the DOT decisionmaker directs otherwise, after the taking of evidence and the receipt of briefs which may include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, if any, the administrative law judge shall take the following action:
                (1) Initial decision. If the proceeding does not involve foreign air transportation, the administrative law judge shall render an “initial decision.” Such decision shall encompass the administrative law judge's decision on the merits of the proceeding and on all ancillary procedural issues remaining for disposition at the close of the hearing.
                (2) Recommended decision. In cases where the action of the Department involves foreign air transportation and is subject to review by the President of the United States pursuant to section 41307 of the Statute, the administrative law judge shall render a “recommended decision.” Such decision shall encompass the administrative law judge's decision on the merits of the proceeding and on all ancillary procedural issues remaining for disposition at the close of the hearing.
                (b) Certification to the DOT decisionmaker for decision. At any time prior to the close of the hearing, the DOT decisionmaker may direct the administrative law judge to certify any question or the entire record in the proceeding to the DOT decisionmaker for decision. In cases where the record is thus certified, the administrative law judge shall not render a decision but shall make a recommendation to the DOT decisionmaker as required by section 8(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 558(a)) unless advised by the DOT decisionmaker that he or she intends to issue a tentative decision.
                (c) Every initial or recommended decision issued shall state the names of the persons who are to be served with copies of it, the time within which exceptions to, or petitions for review of, such decision may be filed, and the time within which briefs in support of the exceptions may be filed. In addition, every such decision shall recite that it is made under delegated authority, and contain notice of the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section. In the event the administrative law judge certifies the record to the DOT decisionmaker without an initial or recommended decision, he or she shall notify the parties of the time within which to file with the DOT decisionmaker briefs which may include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
                (d) Unless a petition for discretionary review is filed pursuant to § 302.32, exceptions are filed pursuant to § 302.217, or the DOT decisionmaker issues an order to review upon his or her own initiative, the initial decision shall become effective as the final order of the Department thirty (30) days after service thereof; in the case of a recommended decision, that decision shall be transmitted to the President of the United States under 49 U.S.C. 41307. If a petition for discretionary review or exceptions are timely filed or action to review is taken by the DOT decisionmaker upon his or her own initiative, the effectiveness of the initial decision or the transmission of the recommended decision is stayed until the further order of the DOT decisionmaker.
              
              
                § 302.32
                Petitions for discretionary review of initial or recommended decisions; review proceedings.
                (a) Petitions for discretionary review. (1) Review by the DOT decisionmaker pursuant to this section is not a matter of right but is at the sole discretion of the DOT decisionmaker. Any party may file and serve a petition for discretionary review by the DOT decisionmaker of an initial decision or recommended decision within twenty-one (21) days after service thereof, unless the DOT decisionmaker sets a different period for filing.
                (2) Petitions for discretionary review shall be filed only upon one or more of the following grounds:
                (i) A finding of a material fact is erroneous;
                (ii) A necessary legal conclusion is without governing precedent or is a departure from or contrary to law, the Department's rules, or precedent;

                (iii) A substantial and important question of law, policy or discretion is involved; or
                
                (iv) A prejudicial procedural error has occurred.
                (3) Each issue shall be separately numbered and plainly and concisely stated. Petitioners shall not restate the same point in repetitive discussions of an issue. Each issue shall be supported by detailed citations of the record when objections are based on the record, and by statutes, regulations or principal authorities relied upon. Any matters of fact or law not argued before the administrative law judge, but that the petitioner proposes to argue on brief to the DOT decisionmaker, shall be stated.
                (4) Petitions for discretionary review shall be self-contained and shall not incorporate by reference any part of another document. Except by permission of the DOT decisionmaker, petitions shall not exceed twenty (20) pages including appendices and other papers physically attached to the petition.
                (5) Requests for oral argument on petitions for discretionary review will not be entertained by the DOT decisionmaker.
                (b) Answers. Within fifteen (15) days after service of a petition for discretionary review, any party may file and serve an answer of not more than fifteen (15) pages in support of or in opposition to the petition. If any party desires to answer more than one petition for discretionary review in the same proceeding, he or she shall do so in a single document of not more than twenty (20) pages.
                (c) Orders declining review. The DOT decisionmaker's order declining to exercise the discretionary right of review will specify the date upon which the administrative law judge's decision shall become effective as the final decision of the Department. A petition for reconsideration of a Department order declining review will be entertained only when the order exercises, in part, the DOT decisionmaker's discretionary right of review, and such petition shall be limited to the single question of whether any issue designated for review and any issue not so designated are so inseparably interrelated that the former cannot be reviewed independently or that the latter cannot be made effective before the final decision of the Department in the review proceeding.
                (d) Review proceedings. (1) The DOT decisionmaker may take review of an initial or recommended decision upon petition or on his or her own initiative or both. The DOT decisionmaker will issue a final order upon such review without further proceedings on any or all the issues where he or she finds that matters raised do not warrant further proceedings.
                (2) Where the DOT decisionmaker desires further proceedings, he or she will issue an order for review that will:
                (i) Specify the issues to which review will be limited. Only those issues specified in the order shall be argued on brief to the DOT decisionmaker, pursuant to § 302.35, and considered by the DOT decisionmaker;
                (ii) Specify the portions of the administrative law judge's decision, if any, that are to be stayed as well as the effective date of the remaining portions thereof; and
                (iii) Designate the parties to the review proceeding.
              
              
                § 302.33
                Tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker.
                (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, whenever the administrative law judge certifies the record in a proceeding directly to the DOT decisionmaker without issuing an initial or recommended decision in the matter, the DOT decisionmaker shall, after consideration of any briefs submitted by the parties, prepare a tentative decision and serve it upon the parties. Every tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker shall state the names of the persons who are to receive copies of it, the time within which exceptions to such decision and briefs, if any, in support of or in opposition to the exceptions may be filed, and the date when such decision will become final in the absence of exceptions thereto. If no exceptions are filed to the tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker within the period fixed, it shall become final at the expiration of such period unless the DOT decisionmaker orders otherwise.

                (b) The DOT decisionmaker may, in his or her discretion, omit a tentative decision in proceedings under subpart B. Final decisions of the DOT decisionmaker are subject to review as provided in § 302.18.
              
              
                § 302.34
                Exceptions to tentative decisions of the DOT decisionmaker.
                (a) Time for filing. Within ten (10) days after service of any tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker, any party to a proceeding may file exceptions to such decision with the DOT decisionmaker.
                (b) Form and contents of exceptions. Each exception shall be separately numbered and shall be stated as a separate point, and appellants shall not restate the same point in several exceptions. Each exception shall state, sufficiently identify, and be limited to, an ultimate conclusion in the decision to which exception is taken (such as, selection of one carrier rather than another to serve any point or points; points included in or excluded from a new route; imposition or failure to impose a given restriction; determination of a rate at a given amount rather than another). No specific exception shall be taken with respect to underlying findings or statements, but exceptions to an ultimate conclusion shall be deemed to include exceptions to all underlying findings and statements pertaining thereto; Provided, however, That exceptions shall specify any matters of law, fact, or policy that were not argued before the administrative law judge but will be set forth for the first time on brief to the DOT decisionmaker.
                (c) Effect of failure to file timely and adequate exceptions. No objection may be made on brief or at a later time to an ultimate conclusion that is not expressly made the subject of an exception in compliance with the provisions of this section; Provided, however, That any party may file a brief in support of the decision and in opposition to the exceptions filed by any other party.
              
              
                § 302.35
                Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker.
                (a) Time for filing. Within such period after the date of service of any tentative decision by the DOT decisionmaker as may be fixed therein, any party may file a brief addressed to the DOT decisionmaker in support of his or her exceptions to such decision or in opposition to the exceptions filed by any other party. Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker on initial or recommended decisions of administrative law judges shall be filed only in those cases where the DOT decisionmaker grants discretionary review and orders further proceedings, pursuant to § 302.32(d)(2), and only upon those issues specified in the order. Such briefs shall be filed within thirty (30) days after date of service of the order granting discretionary review unless otherwise specified in the order. In cases where, because of the limited number of parties and the nature of the issues, the filing of opening, answering, and reply briefs will not unduly delay the proceeding and will assist in its proper disposition, the DOT decisionmaker may direct that the parties file briefs at different times rather than at the same time.
                (b) Effect of failure to restate objections in briefs. In determining the merits of an appeal, the DOT decisionmaker will not consider the exceptions or the petition for discretionary review but will consider only the brief. Each objection contained in the exceptions or each issue specified in the DOT decisionmaker's order exercising discretionary review must be restated and supported by a statement and adequate discussion of all matters relied upon, in a brief filed pursuant to and in compliance with the requirements of this section.
                (c) Formal specifications of briefs—(1) Contents. Each brief shall discuss every point of law, fact, or precedent that the party submitting it is entitled to raise and that it wishes the DOT decisionmaker to consider. Each brief shall include a summary of the argument not to exceed five (5) pages. Support and justification for every point raised shall include itemized references to the pages of the transcript of hearing, exhibit or other matter of record, and citations of the statutes, regulations, or principal authorities relied upon. If a brief or any point discussed in the brief is not in substantial conformity with the requirement for such support and justification, no motion to strike or dismiss such document shall be made but the DOT decisionmaker may disregard the points involved. Copies of briefs may be furnished by use of electronic media in a format acceptable to the Department and the parties.
                (2) Incorporation by reference. Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker shall be completely self-contained and shall not incorporate by reference any portion of any other brief or pleading; Provided, however, That instead of submitting a brief to the DOT decisionmaker a party may adopt by reference specifically identified pages or the whole of his or her prior brief to the administrative law judge if the latter complies with all requirements of this section. In such cases, the party shall file with Department of Transportation Dockets a letter exercising this privilege and serve all parties in the same manner as a brief to the DOT decisionmaker.
                (3) Length. Except by permission or direction of the DOT decisionmaker, briefs shall not exceed fifty (50) pages including pages contained in any appendix, table, chart, or other document physically attached to the brief, but excluding maps and the summary of the argument. In this case “map” means only those pictorial representations of routes, flight paths, mileage, and similar ancillary data that are superimposed on geographic drawings and contain only such text as is needed to explain the pictorial representation.
              
              
                § 302.36
                Oral argument before the DOT decisionmaker.
                (a) If any party desires to argue a case orally before the DOT decisionmaker, he or she shall request leave to make such argument in his or her exceptions or brief. Such request shall be filed no later than the date when briefs before the DOT decisionmaker are due in the proceeding. The DOT decisionmaker will rule on such request, and, if oral argument is to be allowed, all parties to the proceeding will be advised of the date and hour set for such argument and the amount of time allowed to each party. Requests for oral argument on petitions for discretionary review will not be entertained.
                (b) Pamphlets, charts, and other written data may be offered to the DOT decisionmaker at oral argument only in accordance with the following rules: All such material shall be limited to facts in the record of the case being argued and shall be served on all parties to the proceeding with four (4) copies transmitted to Department of Transportation Dockets at least five (5) calendar days in advance of the argument.
              
              
                § 302.37
                Waiver of procedural steps after hearing.
                The parties to any proceeding may agree to waive any one or more of the procedural steps provided in § 302.29 through § 302.36.
              
              
                § 302.38
                Final decision of the DOT Decisionmaker.
                When a case stands submitted to the DOT decisionmaker for final decision on the merits, he or she will dispose of the issues presented by entering an appropriate order that will include a statement of the reasons for his or her findings and conclusions. Such orders shall be deemed “final orders” within the purview of § 302.14(a), in the manner provided by § 302.18.

              Disposition of Applications
              
                § 302.207
                Cases to be decided on written submissions.
                (a) Applications under this subpart will be decided on the basis of written submissions unless the DOT decisionmaker, on petition as provided in § 302.208 or on his or her own initiative, determines that an oral presentation or an administrative law judge's decision is required because:
                (1) Use of written procedures will prejudice a party;
                (2) Material issues of decisional fact cannot adequately be resolved without oral evidentiary hearing procedures; or
                (3) Assignment of an application for oral evidentiary hearing procedures or an initial or recommended decision by an administrative law judge is otherwise required by the public interest.
                (b) The standards employed in deciding cases under § 302.210(a)(1) or (5) shall be the same as the standards applied in cases decided under § 302.210(a)(4). These are the standards set forth in the Statute as interpreted and expanded upon under that Statute.
              
              
                § 302.208
                Petitions for oral presentation or judge's decision.
                (a) Any person may file a petition for oral evidentiary hearing, oral argument, an initial or recommended decision, or any combination of these. Petitions shall demonstrate that one or more of the criteria set forth in § 302.207 are applicable to the issues for which an oral presentation or judge's decision is requested. Such petitions shall be supported by a detailed explanation of the following:
                (1) Why the evidence or argument to be presented cannot be submitted in the form of written evidence or briefs;
                (2) Which issues should be examined by an administrative law judge and why such issues should not be presented directly to the DOT decisionmaker for decision;
                (3) An estimate of the time required for the oral presentation and the number of witnesses whom the petitioner would present; and
                (4) If cross-examination of any witness is desired, the name of the witness, if known, the subject matter of the desired cross-examination or the title or number of the exhibit to be cross-examined, what the petitioner expects to establish by the cross-examination, and an estimate of the time needed for it.

                (b) Petitions for an oral hearing, oral argument, or an administrative law judge's decision shall be filed no later than the due date for answers in proceedings governed by §§ 302.211, 302.212 and 302.213, and be accompanied with the information specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. Filing of the information required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section may be deferred until the DOT decisionmaker has decided to hold a formal proceeding.
                (c) Where a stipulation of disputed facts would eliminate the need for an oral presentation or an administrative law judge's decision, parties shall include in their petitions an offer to withdraw the request should the stipulation be made.
              
              
                § 302.209
                Procedures for deferral of applications.
                Within twenty-eight (28) days after the filing of an application under this subpart, the DOT decisionmaker may defer further processing of the application until all of the information necessary to process that application is submitted. The time periods contained in this subpart with respect to the disposition of the application shall not begin to run until the application is complete. In addition, the DOT decisionmaker may defer action on a foreign air carrier permit application for foreign policy reasons.
              
              
                § 302.210
                Disposition of applications; orders establishing further procedures.
                (a) General requirements. The DOT decisionmaker will take one of the following actions with respect to all or any portion of each application:
                (1) Issue an Order to Show Cause why the application should not be granted, denied or dismissed, in whole or in part.
                (2) Issue a Final Order granting the application if the DOT decisionmaker determines that there are no material issues of fact that warrant further procedures for their resolution.
                (3) Issue a Final Order dismissing or rejecting the application for lack of prosecution or if the application does not comply with this subpart or is otherwise materially deficient.
                (4) Issue an order setting the application for oral evidentiary hearing. The order will establish the scope of the issues to be considered and the procedures to be employed, and will indicate whether one or more attorneys from the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings will participate as a party. All of the procedures set forth in §§ 302.214 through 302.218 will apply unless the DOT decisionmaker decides otherwise.
                (5) Begin to make a determination with respect to the application under simplified procedures without oral evidentiary hearing. In this event, the DOT decisionmaker may indicate which, if any, of the procedural steps set forth in §§ 302.215 through 302.219 will be employed. The DOT decisionmaker may also indicate that other non-oral evidentiary hearing procedures will be employed.
                (b) Additional evidence. An order establishing further procedures under paragraph (a)(1), (4) or (5) of this section may provide for the filing of additional evidence.
                (c) Petitions for reconsideration. Petitions for reconsideration of an order issued under this section will not be entertained except to the extent that the order dismissed or rejected all or part of an application.

                § 302.211
                Procedures in certificate cases involving initial or continuing fitness.
                (a) Applicability. This section applies to cases involving certificate authority under sections 41102 and 41103 of the Statute, including applications for new authority, renewals, amendments, modifications, suspensions, and transfers of such certificates, where the issues involve a determination of the applicant's fitness to operate. Where such applications propose the operation of scheduled service in limited entry international markets, the provisions of § 302.212 also apply.
                (b) Order establishing further procedures. Within 90 days after a complete application is filed, the DOT decisionmaker will take action as provided in § 302.210.

Any person may file an application for the same authority as sought in an application to obtain, renew, or amend a certificate filed under paragraph (a) of this section. Requests to modify the issues to be decided and to consolidate applications filed in other dockets shall be filed as a “motion to modify scope.” Motions and applications under this section shall include economic data, other facts, and any argument in support of the person's position and must be filed within twenty one (21) days after the original application is filed. Later-filed competing applications shall conform to the base and forecast years used by the original applicant and need not contain traffic and financial data for markets for which data have already been submitted by another person.
                (d) Answers to conforming applications or motions to modify scope. Answers to conforming applications and motions to modify scope filed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section shall be filed within fourteen (14) days after the filing of the conforming application or motion. Answers may argue that an application should be dismissed. Answers may also seek to consolidate an application filed in another docket if that application conforms to the scope of the proceeding proposed in the motion to modify scope and includes the information prescribed in § 302.202. Answers and applications shall not, however, propose the consideration of additional markets.
                (e) Order establishing further procedures. Within 90 days after a complete application is filed, the DOT decisionmaker will issue an order as provided in § 302.210.

In addition to the standards set forth in § 302.207(b), the views of other executive agencies, such as the Department of State, and the Federal Aviation Administration's evaluation of the applicant's operational fitness, may be sought in determining the appropriate action on applications filed under this section.
                (c) Order establishing further procedures. As soon as possible after the date that answers are due and all information needed to reach a decision is filed, the DOT decisionmaker will issue an order as provided in § 302.210.

                If the DOT decisionmaker determines under § 302.210(a)(4) that an oral evidentiary hearing should be held, the application or applications will be set for oral hearing before an administrative law judge. The issues will be those set forth in the order establishing further procedures. The procedures in §§ 302.17 to 302.38 governing the conduct of oral evidentiary hearings will apply.

                (a) Fourteen (14) days after the close of the oral evidentiary hearing, unless the administrative law judge determines that, under the circumstances of the case, briefs are not necessary or that the parties will require more time to prepare briefs; or
                (b) Fourteen (14) days after the filing of additional evidence called for in the order establishing further procedures if no oral evidentiary hearing is called for, unless the DOT decisionmaker determines that some other period should be allowed.
              
              
                
                § 302.216
                Administrative law judge's initial or recommended decision.
                (a) In a case that has been set for oral evidentiary hearing under § 302.210(a)(4), the administrative law judge shall adopt and serve an initial or recommended decision within one hundred thirty-six (136) days after the issuance of the order establishing further procedures unless:
                (1) The DOT decisionmaker, having found extraordinary circumstances, has by order delayed the initial or recommended decision by a period of not more than thirty (30) days; or
                (2) An applicant has failed to meet the procedural schedule adopted by the judge or the DOT decisionmaker. In this case, the administrative law judge may, by notice, extend the due date for the issuance of an initial or recommended decision for a period not to exceed the period of delay caused by the applicant.
                (b) In a case in which some of the issues have not been set for oral hearing under § 302.210(a)(4), the administrative law judge shall adopt and serve an initial or recommended decision within the time established by the DOT decisionmaker in the order establishing further procedures, except that that due date may be extended in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
                (c) The initial or recommended decision shall be issued by the administrative law judge fourteen (14) days after it is served. Unless exceptions are filed under § 302.217 or the DOT decisionmaker issues an order to review on his or her own initiative, an initial decision shall become effective as the final order of the Department the day it is issued. Where exceptions are timely filed or the DOT decisionmaker takes action to review on his or her own initiative, the effectiveness of the initial decision is stayed until further order of the DOT decisionmaker.
                (d) In all other respects, the provisions of § 302.31 shall apply.

                § 302.218
                Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker.
                (a) In a case in which an initial or recommended decision has been served and exceptions have been filed, any party may file a brief in support of or in opposition to any exceptions. Such briefs shall be filed within fourteen (14) days after service of the initial or recommended decision.
                (b) In a case in which no exceptions have been filed, briefs shall not be filed unless the DOT decisionmaker has taken review of the initial or recommended decision on his or her own initiative and has specifically provided for the filing of such briefs.
                (c) In all other respect, the provisions of § 302.35 shall apply.

                Oral argument before the DOT decisionmaker.
                If the order establishing further procedures provides for an oral argument, or if the DOT decisionmaker otherwise decides to hear oral argument, all parties will be notified of the date and hour set for that argument and the amount of time allowed each party. The provisions of § 302.36(b) shall also apply.
              
              
                § 302.220

                In addition to the provisions of § 302.38, the following provisions shall apply:

                (a) In the case of a certificate application that has been set for oral evidentiary hearing under § 302.210(a)(4), the Department will issue its final order within ninety (90) days after the initial or recommended decision is issued. If an application has failed to meet the procedural schedule established by the Department, the DOT decisionmaker may, by notice, extend the date for a final decision for a period equal to the period of delay caused by the applicant.
                
                (b) If the DOT decisionmaker does not act in the time period established in paragraph (a) of this section:
                (1) in the case of an application for a certificate to engage in foreign air transportation, the recommended decision shall be transmitted to the President of the United States under 49 U.S.C. 41307; or
                (2) in the case of an application not subject to review by the President of the United States, the initial decision shall become effective as the final order of the Department.
                (c) In the case of a certificate application that has been processed under § 302.210(a)(1) or (5), the Department will issue its final order within one hundred eighty (180) days after the order establishing further procedures. If an applicant has failed to meet the procedural schedule established by the Department, the DOT decisionmaker may, by notice, extend the due date for a final decision for a period equal to the period of delay caused by the applicant.

              (4) Any other application for which the Department decides the requirements of §§ 302.3 and 302.4 are more appropriate. Upon a showing of good cause, an application may be filed by cablegram, telegram, facsimile, electronic mail (when available), or telephone; all such telephonic requests must be confirmed by written application within three (3) business days of the original request.
              (c) Applications for exemption from Chapter 415 of the Statute, from tariffs (except for waivers filed under subpart Q of part 221 of this chapter), or from Department regulations concerning tariffs may be submitted by letter. Three copies of such applications shall be sent to Department of Transportation Dockets.

              (a) Title. An application filed under § 302.302(a) shall be entitled “Application for . . .” (followed by the type of authority request, e.g., exemption, frequency allocation) and, where applicable, shall state if the application involves renewal and/or amendment of existing exemption authority.
              (b) Factual statement. Each application shall state:
              (1) The section(s) of the Statute or the rule, regulation, term, condition, or limitation from which the exemption is requested;
              (2) The proposed effective date and duration of the exemption;
              (3) A description of how the applicant proposes to exercise the authority (for example, applications for exemption from section 41101 or 41301 of the Statute should include at least: places to be served; equipment types, capacity and source; type and frequency or service; and other operations that the proposed service will connect with or support); and
              (4) Any other facts the applicant relies upon to establish that the proposed service will be consistent with the public interest.
              (c) Supporting evidence. (1) Each application shall be accompanied by:
              (i) A statement of economic data, or other matters or information that the applicant desires the Department to officially notice;
              (ii) Affidavits, or statements under penalty of 18 U.S.C. 1001, establishing any other facts the applicant wants the Department to rely upon; and
              (iii) Information showing the applicant is qualified to perform the proposed services.
              (2) In addition to the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an application for exemption from section 41101 or 41301 of the Statute (except exemptions under section 40109(g)) shall state whether the authority sought is governed by a bilateral agreement or by principles of comity and reciprocity. Applications by foreign carriers shall state whether the applicant's homeland government grants U.S. carriers authority similar to that requested. If so, the application shall state whether the fact of reciprocity has been established by the Department and cite the pertinent finding. If the fact of reciprocity has not been established by the Department, the application shall include documentation to establish such reciprocity.
              (d) Emergency cabotage. Applications under section 40109(g) of the Statute shall, in addition to the information required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, contain evidence showing that:
              (1) Because of an emergency created by unusual circumstances not arising in the normal course of business, traffic in the markets requested cannot be accommodated by air carriers holding certificates under section 41102 of the Statute;
              (2) All possible efforts have been made to accommodate the traffic by using the resources of such air carriers (including, for example, the use of foreign aircraft, or sections of foreign aircraft, under lease or charter to such air carriers, and the use of such air carriers' reservation systems to the extent practicable);
              (3) The authority requested is necessary to avoid unreasonable hardship for the traffic in the market that cannot be accommodated by air carriers; and
              (4) In any case where an inability to accommodate traffic in a market results from a labor dispute, the grant of the requested exemption will not result in an unreasonable advantage to any party in the dispute.
              (e) Renewal applications. An application requesting renewal of an exemption or other limited authority under this subpart that is intended to invoke the automatic extension provisions of 5 U.S.C. 558(c) shall comply with, and contain the statements and information required by part 377 of this chapter.

              § 302.306
              Dismissal or rejection of incomplete applications.
              (a) Dismissal or rejection. The Department may dismiss or reject any application for exemption that does not comply with the requirements of this part.
              (b) Additional data. The Department may require the filing of additional data with respect to any application for exemption, answer, or reply.
            
            
              § 302.307
              Answers to applications.

              Within fifteen (15) days after the filing of an application for exemption, any person may file an answer in support of or in opposition to the grant of a requested exemption. Such answer shall set forth in detail the reasons why the exemption should be granted or denied. An answer shall include a statement of economic data or other matters the Department is requested to officially notice, and shall be accompanied by affidavits establishing any other facts relied upon.
            
            
              § 302.308
              Replies to answers.

              § 302.309
              Requests for hearing.
              The Department will not normally conduct oral evidentiary hearings concerning applications for exemption. However, the Department may, in its discretion, order such a hearing on an application. Any applicant, or any person opposing an application, may request an oral evidentiary hearing. Such a request shall set forth in detail the reasons why the filing of affidavits or other written evidence will not permit the fair and expeditious disposition of the application. A request relying on factual assertions shall be accompanied by affidavits establishing such facts. If the Department orders an oral evidentiary hearing, the procedures in subpart A of this part shall apply.
            
            
              § 302.310
              Exemptions on the Department's initiative.
              The Department may grant exemptions on its own initiative when it finds that such exemptions are required by the circumstances and consistent with the public interest.
            
            
              § 302.311
              Emergency exemptions.
              (a) Shortened procedures. When required by the circumstances and consistent with the public interest, the Department may take action, without notice, on exemption applications prior to the expiration of the normal period for filing answers and replies. When required in a particular proceeding, the Department may specify a lesser time for the filing of answers and replies, and notify interested persons of this time period.
              (b)(1) Applications. Applications for emergency exemption need not conform to the requirements of this subpart or of subpart A of this part (except as provided in this section and in § 302.303(d) concerning emergency cabotage requests). However, an application for emergency exemption must normally be in writing and must state in detail the facts and evidence that support the application, the grounds for the exemption, and the public interest basis for the authority sought. In addition, the application shall state specific reasons that justify departure from the normal exemption application procedures. The application shall also identify those persons notified as required by paragraph (c) of this section. The Department may require additional information from any applicant before acting on an application.
              (2) Oral requests. The Department will consider oral requests, including telephone requests, for emergency exemption authority under this section in circumstances that do not permit the immediate filing of a written application. All oral requests must, however, provide the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except that actual evidence in support of the application need not be tendered when the request is made. All oral requests must be confirmed by written application, together with all supporting evidence, within three (3) business days of the original request.
              (c) Notice. Except when the Department decides that no notice need be given, applicants for emergency exemption shall notify, as appropriate, those persons specified in § 302.304(b) of this subpart. Such notification shall be made in the same manner, contain the same information, and be dispatched at the same time, as the application made to the Department.
            
          
          
            Subpart D—Rules Applicable to Enforcement Proceedings
            
              § 302.401
              Applicability.
              This subpart contains the specific rules that apply to Department proceedings to enforce the provisions of Subtitle VII of the Statute, and the rules, regulations, orders and other requirements issued by the Department, as well as the filing of informal and formal complaints. Except as modified by this subpart, the provisions of subpart A of this part apply.
            
            
              § 302.402
              Definitions.
              
                Assistant General Counsel, when used in this subpart, refers to the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings.
              
                Complainant refers to the person filing a complaint.
              
                Parties, when used in this subpart, include the Office of the Assistant General Counsel, the respondent, the complainant, and any other person permitted to intervene under § 302.20.
              
                Respondent refers to the person against whom a complaint is filed.
            
            
              § 302.403
              Informal complaints.
              Any person may submit in writing to the Assistant General Counsel an informal complaint with respect to anything done or omitted to be done by any person in contravention of any provision of the Statute or any requirement established thereunder. Such informal complaints need not otherwise comply with the provisions of this part. Matters so presented may, if their nature warrants, be handled by correspondence or conference with the appropriate persons. Any matter not disposed of informally may be made the subject of an enforcement proceeding pursuant to this subpart. The filing of an informal complaint shall not bar the subsequent filing of a formal complaint.
            
            
              § 302.404
              Formal complaints.
              (a) Filing. Any person may make a formal complaint to the Assistant General Counsel about any violation of the economic regulatory provisions of the Statute or of the Department's rules, regulations, orders, or other requirements. Every formal complaint shall conform to the requirements of §§ 302.3 and 302.4, concerning the form and filing of documents. The filing of a complaint shall result in the institution of an enforcement proceeding only if the Assistant General Counsel issues a notice instituting such a proceeding as to all or part of the complaint under § 302.406(a) or the Deputy General Counsel does so under § 302.406(c).
              (b) Amendment. A formal complaint may be amended at any time before service of an answer to the complaint. After service of an answer but before institution of an enforcement proceeding, the complaint may be amended with the permission of the Assistant General Counsel. After institution of an enforcement proceeding, the complaint may be amended only on grant of a motion filed under § 302.11.
              (c) Insufficiency of formal complaint. In any case where the Assistant General Counsel is of the opinion that a complaint does not sufficiently set forth matters required by any applicable rule, regulation or order of the Department, or is otherwise insufficient, he or she may advise the complainant of the deficiency and require that any additional information be supplied by amendment.
              (d) Joinder of complaints or complainants. Two or more grounds of complaints involving substantially the same purposes, subject or state of facts may be included in one complaint even though they involve more than one respondent. Two or more complainants may join in one complaint if their respective causes of complaint are against the same party or parties and involve substantially the same purposes, subject or state of facts. The Assistant General Counsel may separate or split complaints if he or she finds that the joinder of complaints, complainants, or respondents will not be conducive to the proper dispatch of the Department's business or the ends of justice.
              (e) Service. A formal complaint, and any amendments thereto, shall be served by the person filing such documents upon each party complained of, upon the Deputy General Counsel, and upon the Assistant General Counsel.
            
            
              § 302.405
              Responsive documents.
              (a) Answers. Within fifteen (15) days after the date of service of a formal complaint, each respondent shall file an answer in conformance with and subject to the requirements of § 302.408(b). Extensions of time for filing an answer may be granted by the Assistant General Counsel for good cause shown.
              (b) Offers to satisfy. A respondent in a formal complaint may offer to satisfy the complaint through submission of facts, offer of settlement or proposal of adjustment. Such offer shall be in writing and shall be served, within fifteen (15) days after service of the complaint, upon the same persons and in the same manner as an answer. The submittal of an offer to satisfy the complaint shall not excuse the filing of an answer.
              (c) Motions to dismiss. Motions to dismiss a formal complaint shall not be filed prior to the filing of a notice instituting an enforcement proceeding with respect to such complaint or a portion thereof.
            
            
              § 302.406
              Procedure for responding to formal complaints.
              (a) Within a reasonable time after an answer to a formal complaint is filed, the Assistant General Counsel shall either:
              (1) Issue a notice instituting a formal enforcement proceeding in accordance with § 302.407 or
              (2) Issue an order dismissing the complaint in whole or in part, stating the reasons for such dismissal.
              (b) An order dismissing a complaint issued pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall become effective as a final order of the Department thirty (30) days after service thereof.
              (c) Whenever the Assistant General Counsel has failed to act on a formal complaint within a reasonable time after an answer is due, the following motions may be addressed to the Deputy General Counsel:
              (1) By the complainant to institute an enforcement proceeding by docketing the complaint upon a showing that it is in the public interest to do so; and
              (2) By the respondent to dismiss the complaint upon a showing that it is in the public interest to do so.
              (d) The Deputy General Counsel may grant, deny, or defer any of the motions, in whole or in part, and take appropriate action to carry out his or her decision.
            
            
              § 302.407
              Commencement of enforcement proceeding.
              (a) Whenever in the opinion of the Assistant General Counsel there are reasonable grounds to believe that any economic regulatory provision of the Statute, or any rule, regulation, order, limitation, condition, or other requirement established pursuant thereto, has been or is being violated, that efforts to satisfy a complaint as provided by § 302.405 have failed, and that the investigation of any or all of the alleged violations is in the public interest, the Assistant General Counsel may issue a notice instituting an enforcement proceeding before an administrative law judge.
              (b) The notice shall incorporate by reference the formal complaint submitted pursuant to § 302.404 or shall be accompanied by a complaint by an attorney from the Office of the Assistant General Counsel. The notice and accompanying complaint, if any, shall be formally served upon each respondent and each complainant.
              (c) The proceedings thus instituted shall be processed in regular course in accordance with this part. However, nothing in this part shall be construed to limit the authority of the Department to institute or conduct any investigation or inquiry within its jurisdiction in any other manner or according to any other procedures that it may deem necessary or proper.
              (d) Whenever the Assistant General Counsel seeks an assessment of civil penalties in an enforcement proceeding, he or she shall serve on all parties to the proceeding a notice of the violations alleged and the amount of penalties for which the respondent may be liable. The notice may be included in the notice instituting a formal enforcement proceeding or in a separate document.
              (e) In any proceeding in which civil penalties are sought, any decisions issued by the Department shall state the amount of any civil penalties assessed upon a finding of violation, and the time and manner in which payment shall be made to the United States.
            
            
              § 302.408
              Answers and replies.
              (a) Within fifteen (15) days after the date of service of a notice issued pursuant to § 302.407, the respondent shall file an answer to the complaint attached thereto or incorporated therein unless an answer has already been filed in accordance with § 302.405. Any requests for extension of time for filing of an answer to such complaint shall be filed in accordance with § 302.11.

              (b) All answers shall be served in accordance with § 302.7 and shall fully and completely advise the parties and the Department as to the nature of the defense and shall admit or deny specifically and in detail each allegation of the complaint unless the respondent is without knowledge, in which case, his or her answer shall so state and the statement shall operate as a denial. Allegations of fact not denied or controverted shall be deemed admitted. Matters alleged as affirmative defenses shall be separately stated and numbered and shall, in the absence of a reply, be deemed to be controverted. Any answer to a complaint, or response to a notice, proposing the assessment of civil penalties shall specifically present any matters that the respondent intends to rely upon in opposition to, or in mitigation of, such civil penalties.
              (c) The DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge may, in his or her discretion, require or permit the filing of a reply in appropriate cases; otherwise, no reply may be filed.
            
            
              § 302.409
              Default.

              Failure of a respondent to file and serve an answer within the time and in the manner prescribed by § 302.408 shall be deemed to authorize the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge, as a matter of discretion, to find the facts alleged in the complaint incorporated in or accompanying the notice instituting a formal enforcement proceeding to be true and to enter such orders as may be appropriate without notice or hearing, or, as a matter of discretion, to proceed to take proof, without notice, of the allegations or charges set forth in the complaint or order; Provided, that the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge may permit late filing of an answer for good cause shown.
            
            
              § 302.410
              Consolidation of proceedings.
              The DOT decisionmaker or Chief Administrative Law Judge may, upon his or her own initiative, or upon motion of any party, consolidate for hearing or for other purposes, or may contemporaneously consider, two or more enforcement proceedings that involve substantially the same parties or issues that are the same or closely related, if he or she finds that such consolidation or contemporaneous hearing will be conducive to the dispatch of business and to the ends of justice and will not unduly delay the proceedings.
            
            
              § 302.411
              Motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.
              (a) At any time after an answer has been filed, any party may file with the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment, including supporting affidavits. The procedure on such motions shall be in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.), particularly Rules 6(d), 7(b), 12, and 56, except that answers and supporting papers to a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment shall be filed within seven (7) days after service of the motion.
              (b) Parties may petition the DOT decisionmaker to review any action by the administrative law judge granting summary judgment or dismissing an enforcement proceeding under the procedure established for review of an initial decision in § 302.32.
            
            
              § 302.412
              Admissions as to facts and documents.
              (a) At any time after an answer has been filed, any party may file with the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge and serve upon the opposing side a written request for the admission of the genuineness and authenticity of any relevant documents described in and exhibited with the request or for the admission of the truth of any relevant matters of fact stated in the request with respect to such documents.

              (b) Each of the matters of which an admission is requested shall be deemed admitted unless within a period designated in the request, not less than ten (10) days after service thereof, or within such further time as the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge may allow upon motion and notice, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either denying specifically the matters of which an admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why he or she cannot truthfully either admit or deny such matters.
              
              (c) Service of such request and answering statement shall be made as provided in § 302.7. Any admission made by a party pursuant to such request is only for the purposes of the pending proceeding, or any proceeding or action instituted for the enforcement of any order entered therein, and shall not constitute an admission by him or her for any other purpose or be used against him or her in any other proceeding or action.
            
            
              § 302.413
              Evidence of previous violations.
              Evidence of previous violations by any person or of any provision of the Statute or any requirement thereunder found by the Department or a court in any other proceeding or criminal or civil action may, if relevant and material, be admitted in any enforcement proceeding involving such person.
            
            
              § 302.414
              Prehearing conference.
              A prehearing conference may be held in an enforcement proceeding whenever the administrative law judge believes that the fair and expeditious disposition of the proceeding requires one. If a prehearing conference is held, it shall be conducted in accordance with § 302.22.
            
            
              § 302.415
              Hearing.
              After the issues have been formulated, whether by the pleadings or otherwise, the administrative law judge shall give the parties reasonable written notice of the time and place of the hearings. Except as may be modified by the provisions of this subpart, the procedures in §§ 302.17 to 302.38 governing the conduct of oral evidentiary hearings will apply.
            
            
              § 302.416
              Appearances by persons not parties.
              With consent of the administrative law judge, appearances may be entered without request for or grant of permission to intervene by interested persons who are not parties to the proceeding. Such persons may, with the consent of the administrative law judge, cross-examine a particular witness or suggest to any party or counsel therefor questions or interrogations to be asked witnesses called by any party, but may not otherwise examine witnesses and may not introduce evidence or otherwise participate in the proceeding. However, such persons may present to both the administrative law judge and the DOT decisionmaker an oral or written statement of their position on the issues involved in the proceeding.
            
            
              § 302.417
              Settlement of proceedings.
              (a) The Deputy General Counsel and the respondent may agree to settle all or some of the issues in an enforcement proceeding at any time before a final decision is issued by the DOT decisionmaker. The Deputy General Counsel shall serve a copy of any proposed settlement on each party and shall submit the proposed settlement to the administrative law judge for approval. The submission of a proposed settlement shall not automatically delay the proceeding.
              (b) Any party to the proceeding may submit written comments supporting or opposing the proposed settlement within ten (10) days from the date of service.
              (c) The administrative law judge shall approve the proposed settlement, as submitted, if it appears to be in the public interest, or otherwise shall disapprove it.
              (d) Information relating to settlement offers and negotiations will be withheld from public disclosure if the Deputy General Counsel determines that disclosure would interfere with the likelihood of settlement of an enforcement proceeding.
            
            
              § 302.418
              Motions for immediate suspension of operating authority pendente lite.
              All motions for the suspension of the economic operating authority of an air carrier during the pendency of proceedings to revoke such authority shall be filed with, and decided by, the DOT decisionmaker. Proceedings on the motion shall be in accordance with § 302.11. In addition, the DOT decisionmaker shall afford the parties an opportunity for oral argument on such motion.
            
            
              
              § 302.419
              Modification or dissolution of enforcement actions.
              Whenever any party to a proceeding, in which an order of the Department has been issued pursuant to section 46101 of the Statute or an injunction or other form of enforcement action has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to section 46106 of the Statute, believes that changed conditions of fact or law or the public interest require that said order or judicial action be modified or set aside, in whole or in part, such party may file with the Department a motion requesting that the Department take such administrative action or join in applying to the appropriate court for such judicial action, as the case may be. The motion shall state the changes desired and the changed circumstances warranting such action, and shall include the materials and argument in support thereof. The motion shall be served on each party to the proceeding in which the enforcement action was taken. Within thirty (30) days after the service of such motion, any party so served may file an answer thereto. The Department shall dispose of the motion by such procedure as it deems appropriate.
            
            
              § 302.420
              Saving clause.
              Repeal, revision or amendment of any of the economic regulatory provisions of the Statute or of the Department's rules, regulations, orders, or other requirements shall not affect any pending enforcement proceeding or any enforcement proceeding initiated thereafter with respect to causes arising or acts committed prior to said repeal, revision or amendment, unless the act of repeal, revision or amendment specifically so provides.

              Dismissal of petition or complaint.

              § 302.505

            Subpart F—Rules Applicable to Proceedings Concerning Airport Fees
            
              § 302.601
              Applicability.
              (a) This subpart contains the specific rules that apply to a complaint filed by one or more air carriers or foreign air carriers (“carriers”), pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 47129(a), for a determination of the reasonableness of a fee increase or a newly established fee for aeronautical uses that is imposed upon the carrier by the owner or operator of an airport. This subpart also applies to requests by the owner or operator of an airport for such a determination. An airport owner or operator is considered to have imposed a fee on a carrier when it has taken all steps necessary under its procedures to establish the fee, whether or not the fee is being collected or carriers are currently required to pay it.
              (b) This subpart does not apply to—
              (1) A fee imposed pursuant to a written agreement with a carrier using the facilities of an airport;
              (2) A fee imposed pursuant to a financing agreement or covenant entered into prior to August 23, 1994, or
              (3) Any other existing fee not in dispute as of August 23, 1994.
              (c) Except as modified by this subpart, the provisions of subpart A of this part apply.
            
            
              § 302.602
              Complaint by a carrier; request for determination by an airport owner or operator.

              (a) Any carrier may file a complaint with the Secretary for a determination as to the reasonableness of any fee imposed on the carrier by the owner or operator of an airport. Any airport owner or operator may also request such a determination with respect to a fee it has imposed on one or more carriers.

              (b) If a carrier has previously filed a complaint with respect to the same airport fee or fees, any complaint by another carrier and any airport request for determination shall be filed no later than seven (7) calendar days following the initial complaint. In addition, all complaints or requests for determination must be filed on or before the sixtieth (60th) day after the carrier receives written notice of the imposition of the new fee or the imposition of the increase in the fee.
              (c) To ensure an orderly disposition of the matter, all complaints and any request for determination filed with respect to the same airport fee or fees will be considered in a consolidated proceeding, as provided in § 302.606.

              (a) The complaint or request for determination shall set forth the entire grounds for requesting a determination of the reasonableness of the airport fee. The complaint or request shall include a copy of the airport owner or operator's written notice to the carrier of the imposition of the fee, a statement of position with a brief, and all supporting testimony and exhibits on which the filing party intends to rely.

              (2) That the carrier has previously attempted to resolve the dispute directly with the airport owner or operator;
              (3) That when there is information on which the carrier intends to rely that is not included with the brief, exhibits, or testimony, the information has been omitted because the airport owner or operator has not made that information available to the carrier. The certification shall specify the date and form of the carrier's request for information from the airport owner or operator; and
              (4) That any submission on computer diskette is a true copy of the data file used to prepare the printed versions of the exhibits or briefs.
              (d) When an airport owner or operator files a request for determination, it must also certify:

              (1) That it has served on all carriers serving the airport the request, brief, and all supporting testimony and exhibits, and that those parties have received or will receive these documents no later than the date the request is filed.

              (b) The answer to a complaint or request for determination shall set forth the answering party's entire response. When one or more additional complaints or a request for determination has been filed pursuant to § 302.602(b) with respect to the same airport's fee or fees, the answer shall set forth the answering party's entire response to all complaints and any such request for determination. The answer shall include a statement of position with a brief and any supporting testimony and exhibits on which the answering party intends to rely. In lieu of submitting duplicative exhibits or testimony, the answering party may incorporate by reference testimony and exhibits already filed in the same proceeding.

              § 302.606
              Review of complaints or requests for determination.
              (a) Within thirty (30) days after a complaint or request for determination is filed under this subpart, the Secretary will determine whether the complaint or request meets the procedural requirements of this subpart and whether a significant dispute exists, and take appropriate action pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section. When both a complaint and a request for determination have been filed with respect to the same airport fee or fees, the Secretary will issue a determination as to whether the complaint, the request, or both meet the procedural requirements of this subpart and whether a significant dispute exists within thirty (30) days after the complaint is filed.
              (b) If the Secretary determines that a significant dispute exists, he or she will issue an instituting order assigning the complaint or request for hearing before an administrative law judge. The instituting order will—
              (1) Establish the scope of the issues to be considered and the procedures to be employed;
              (2) Indicate the parties to participate in the hearing;
              (3) Consolidate into a single proceeding all complaints and any request for determination with respect to the fee or fees in dispute; and
              (4) Include any special provisions for exchange or disclosure of information by the parties.
              (c) If the Secretary determines that the complaint or request does not meet the procedural requirements of this subpart, the complaint or request for determination will be dismissed without prejudice to filing a new complaint. The order of the Secretary will set forth the terms and conditions under which a revised complaint or request may be filed.
              (d) If the Secretary finds that no significant dispute exists—
              (1) If the proceeding was instituted by a complaint, the Secretary will issue an order dismissing the complaint, which will contain a concise explanation of the reasons for the determination that the dispute is not significant.
              (2) If the proceeding was instituted by a request for determination, the Secretary will either issue a final order as provided in § 302.610 or set forth the schedule for any additional procedures required to complete the proceeding.
            
            
              § 302.607

              (b) Petitions for discretionary review shall comply with § 302.32(a). The petitioner must also certify that it has served the petition by hand, by electronic transmission, or by overnight express delivery on all parties to the proceeding and that those parties have received or will receive the petition no later than the date it is filed.
              (c) Any party may file an answer in support of or in opposition to any petition for discretionary review. The answer shall be filed within four (4) calendar days after service of the petition for discretionary review. The answer shall comply with the page limits specified in § 302.32(b).
            
            
              § 302.609
              Completion of proceedings.
              (a) When a complaint or a request for determination with respect to an airport fee or fees has been filed under this subpart and has not been dismissed, the Secretary will issue a determination as to whether the fee is reasonable within 120 days after the complaint or request is filed.
              (b) When both a complaint and a request for determination have been filed with respect to the same airport fee or fees and have not been dismissed, the Secretary will issue a determination as to whether the fee is reasonable within 120 days after the complaint is filed.
            
            
              
              § 302.610
              Final order.
              (a) When a complaint or request for determination stands submitted to the Secretary for final decision on the merits, he or she may dispose of the issues presented by entering an appropriate order, which will include a statement of the reasons for his or her findings and conclusions. Such an order shall be deemed a final order of the Secretary.
              (b) The final order of the Secretary shall include, where necessary, directions regarding an appropriate refund or credit of the fee increase or newly established fee which is the subject of the complaint or request for determination.
              (c) If the Secretary has not issued a final order within 120 days after the filing of a complaint by an air carrier or foreign air carrier, the decision of the administrative law judge shall be deemed to be the final order of the Secretary.

              § 302.701
              Applicability.
              (a) This subpart sets forth the special rules applicable to proceedings for the establishment of mail rates by the Department for foreign air transportation and air transportation between points in Alaska, and certain contractual arrangements between the U.S. Postal Service and certificated air carriers for the carriage of mail in foreign air transportation entered into pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 5402(a), 84 Stat. 772.
              (b) Such contracts must be for the transportation of at least 750 pounds of mail per flight, and no more than five (5) percent, based on weight, of the international mail transported under any such contract may consist of letter mail.
            
            
              Final Mail Rate Proceedings
              
                § 302.702
                Institution of proceedings.
                (a) Proceedings for the determination of rates of compensation for the transportation of mail may be commenced by the filing of a petition by an air carrier whose rate is to be fixed, or the U.S. Postal Service, or upon the issuance of an order by the DOT decisionmaker.
                (b) The petition shall set forth the rate or rates sought to be established, a statement that they are believed to be fair and reasonable, the reasons supporting the request for a change in rates, and a detailed economic justification sufficient to establish the reasonableness of the rate or rates proposed.
                (c) In any case where an air carrier is operating under a final mail rate uniformly applicable to an entire rate-making unit as established by the DOT decisionmaker, a petition must clearly and unequivocally challenge the rate for such entire rate-making unit and not only a part of such unit.
                (d) All petitions, amended petitions, and documents relating thereto shall be served upon the U.S. Postal Service by sending a copy to the Assistant General Counsel, Transportation Division, Washington, DC 20260-1124, by registered or certified mail, postpaid, prior to the filing thereof with the Department. Proof of service on the U.S. Postal Service shall consist of a statement in the document that the person filing it has served a copy as required by this section.
                (e) Answers to petitions shall be filed within twenty (20) days after service of the petition.
              
              
                § 302.703
                Order to show cause or instituting a hearing.
                Whether the proceeding is commenced by the filing of a petition or upon the Department's own initiative, the DOT decisionmaker may issue an order directing the respondent to show cause why it should not adopt such findings and conclusions and such final rates as may be specified in the order to show cause, or may issue an order setting the matter for hearing before an administrative law judge.
              
              
                § 302.704
                Objections and answers to order to show cause.

                (a) Where an order to show cause is issued, any person having objections to the rates specified in such order shall file with the DOT decisionmaker an answer within forty-five (45) days after the date of service of such order or within such other period as the order may specify.
                (b) An answer to an order to show cause shall contain specific objections, and shall set forth the findings and conclusions, the rates, and the supporting exhibits that would be substituted for the corresponding items in the findings and conclusions of the show cause order, if such objections were found valid.
                (c) An answer filed by a person who is neither a party nor a person ultimately permitted to intervene in an oral evidentiary hearing if such proceeding is established shall be treated as a memorandum filed under § 302.706.
              
              
                § 302.705
                Further procedures.
                (a) If no answer is filed within the designated time, or if a timely filed answer raises no material issue of fact, the DOT decisionmaker may, upon the basis of the record in the proceeding, enter a final order fixing the rate or rates.
                (b) If an answer raising a material issue of fact is filed within the time designated in the Department's order, the DOT decisionmaker may then issue an order authorizing additional pleadings and/or establishing further procedural steps, including setting the matter for oral evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge.
              
              
                § 302.706
                Hearing.
                (a) If a hearing is ordered under § 302.705, the issues at such hearing shall be formulated in accordance with the instituting order, except that at a prehearing conference, the administrative law judge may permit the parties to raise such additional issues as he or she deems necessary to make a full determination of a fair and reasonable rate.
                (b)(1) The parties to the proceeding shall be the air carrier or carriers for whom rates are to be fixed, the U.S. Postal Service, the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings and any other person whom the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge permits to intervene in accordance with § 302.20.
                (2) In addition to participation in hearings in accordance with § 302.19, persons other than parties may, within the time fixed for filing an answer to an order to show cause as provided in § 302.704, submit a memorandum of opposition to, or in support of, the position taken in the petition or order. Such memorandum shall not be received as evidence in the proceeding.
                (c) All direct evidence shall be in writing and shall be filed in exhibit form within the times specified by the DOT decisionmaker or by the administrative law judge.
                (d) Except as modified by this subpart, the provisions of §§ 302.17 through 302.38 of this part shall apply.
              
            
            
              Provision for Temporary Rate
              
                § 302.707
                Procedure for fixing temporary mail rates.
                At any time during the pendency of a proceeding for the determination of final mail rates, the DOT decisionmaker, upon his or her own initiative, or on petition by the air carrier whose rates are in issue or by the U.S. Postal Service, may fix temporary rates of compensation for the transportation of mail subject to downward or upward adjustment upon the determination of final mail rates.
              
            
            
              Informal Mail Rate Conference Procedure
              
                § 302.708
                Invocation of procedure.
                (a) Conferences between DOT employees, representatives of air carriers, the U.S. Postal Service and other interested persons may be called by DOT employees for the purpose of considering and clarifying issues and factual material in pending proceedings for the establishment of rates for the transportation of mail.

                (b) At the commencement of an informal mail rate conference pursuant to this section, the authorized DOT employees conducting such conference shall issue to each person present at such conference a written statement to the effect that such conference is being conducted pursuant to this section and stating the time of commencement of such conference; and at the termination of such conference the DOT employees conducting such conference shall note in writing on such statement the time of termination of such conference.
              
              
                § 302.709
                Scope of conferences.
                The mail rate conferences shall be limited to the discussion of, and possible agreement on, particular issues and related factual material in accordance with sound rate-making principles. The duties and powers of DOT employees in rate conferences essentially will not be different, therefore, from the duties and powers they have in the processing of rate cases not involving a rate conference. The employees' function in both instances is to present clearly to the DOT decisionmaker the issues and the related material facts, together with recommendations. The DOT decisionmaker will make an independent determination of the soundness of the employees's analyses and recommendations.
              
              
                § 302.710
                Participants in conferences.
                The persons entitled to be present in mail rate conferences will be the representatives of the carrier whose rates are in issue, the staff of the U.S. Postal Service, and the authorized DOT employees. No other person will attend unless the DOT employees deem his or her presence necessary in the interest of one or more purposes to be accomplished, and in such case his or her participation will be limited to such specific purposes. No person, however, shall have the duty to attend merely by reason of invitation by the authorized DOT employees.
              
              
                § 302.711
                Conditions upon participation.
                (a) Nondisclosure of information. As a condition to participation, every participant, during the period of the conference and for ninety (90) days after its termination, or until the Department takes public action with respect to the facts and issues covered in the conference, whichever is earlier:
                (1) Shall, except for necessary disclosures in the course of employment in connection with conference business, hold the information obtained in conference in absolute confidence and trust;
                (2) Shall not deal, directly or indirectly, for the account of himself or herself, his or her immediate family, members of his or her firm or company, or as a trustee, in securities of the air carrier involved in the rate conference except that under exceptional circumstances special permission may be obtained in advance from the DOT decisionmaker; and
                (3) Shall adopt effective controls for the confidential handling of such information and shall instruct personnel under his or her supervision, who by reason of their employment come into possession of information obtained at the conference, that such information is confidential and must not be disclosed to anyone except to the extent absolutely necessary in the course of employment, and must not be misused. (The term “information”, as used in this section, shall refer only to information obtained at the conference regarding the future course of action or position of the Department or its employees with respect to the facts or issues discussed at the conference.)
                (b) Signed statement required. Every representative of an air carrier actually present at any conference shall sign a statement that he or she has read this entire instruction and promises to abide by it and advise any other participant to whom he or she discloses any confidential information of the restrictions imposed above. Every representative of the U.S. Postal Service actually present at any conference shall, on his or her own behalf, sign a statement to the same effect.
                (c) Presumption of having conference information. A director of any air carrier that has had a representative at the conference, who deals either directly or indirectly for himself or herself, his or her immediate family, members of his or her firm or company, or as a trustee, in securities of the air carrier involved in the conference, during the restricted period set forth above, shall be presumed to have come into possession of information obtained at the conference knowing that such information was subject to the restrictions imposed above; but such presumption can be rebutted.
                (d) Compliance report required. Within ten (10) days after the expiration of the time specified for keeping conference matters confidential, every participant, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, shall file a verified compliance report with Department of Transportation Dockets stating that he or she has complied in every respect with the conditions of this section, or if he or she has not so complied, stating in detail in what respects he or she has failed to comply.
                (e) Persons subject to the provisions of this section. For the purposes of this section, participants shall include:
                (1) Any representative of any air carrier and any representative of the U.S. Postal Service actually present at the conference;
                (2) The directors and the officers of any air carrier that had a representative at the conference;
                (3) The members of any firm of attorneys or consultants that had a representative at the conference; and
                (4) The members of the U.S. Postal Service staff who come into possession of information obtained at the conference, knowing that such information is subject to the restrictions imposed in this section.
              
              
                § 302.712
                Information to be requested from an air carrier.
                When an air carrier is requested to submit detailed estimates as to traffic, revenues and expenses by appropriate periods and the investment that will be required to perform the operations for a future period, full and adequate support shall be presented for all estimates, particularly where such estimates deviate materially from the air carrier's experience. With respect to the rate for a past period, essentially the same procedure shall be followed. Other information or data likewise may be requested by the DOT employees. All data submitted by the air carrier shall be certified by a responsible officer.
              
              
                § 302.713
                DOT analysis of data for submission of answers thereto.
                After a careful analysis of these data, the DOT employees will, in most cases, send the air carrier a statement of exceptions showing areas of differences. Where practicable, the air carrier may submit an answer to these exceptions. Conferences will then be scheduled to resolve the issues and facts in accordance with sound ratemaking principles.
              
              
                § 302.714
                Availability of data to the U.S. Postal Service.

                The representatives of the U.S. Postal Service shall have access to all conference data and, insofar as practicable, shall be furnished copies of all pertinent data prepared by the DOT employees and the air carrier, and a reasonable time shall be allowed to review the facts and issues and to make any presentation deemed necessary; Provided, That in cases other than those involving an issue as to the service mail rates payable by the U.S. Postal Service pursuant to section 41901 of the Statute, representatives of the U.S. Postal Service shall be furnished with copies of data under this provision only upon their written request.
              
              
                § 302.715
                Post-conference procedure.
                No briefs, argument, or any formal steps will be entertained by the DOT decisionmaker after the rate conferences. The form, content and time of the staff's presentation to the DOT decisionmaker are entirely matters of internal procedure. Any party to the mail rate proceeding may, through an authorized DOT employee, request the opportunity to submit a written or oral statement to the DOT decisionmaker on any unresolved issue. The DOT decisionmaker will grant such requests whenever he or she deems such action desirable in the interest of further clarification and understanding of the issues. The granting of an opportunity for such further presentation shall not, however, impair the rights that any party might otherwise have under the Statute and this part.
              
              
                § 302.716
                Effect of conference agreements.

                No agreements or understandings reached in rate conferences as to facts or issues shall in any respect be binding on the Department or any participant. Any party to mail rate proceedings will have the same rights to file an answer and take other procedural steps as though no rate conference had been held. The fact, however, that a rate conference was held and certain agreements or understandings may have been reached on certain facts and issues renders it proper to provide that, upon the filing of an answer by any party to the rate proceeding, all issues going to the establishment of a rate shall be open, except insofar as limited in prehearing conference in accordance with § 302.22.
              
              
                § 302.717
                Waiver of participant conditions.
                After the termination of a mail rate conference hereunder, the air carrier whose rates were in issue may petition the DOT decisionmaker for a release from the obligations imposed upon it and all other persons by § 302.711. The DOT decisionmaker will grant such petition only after a detailed and convincing showing is made in the petition and supporting exhibits and documents that there is no reasonable possibility that any of the abuses sought to be prevented will occur or that the Department's processes will in any way be prejudiced. There will be no hearing or oral argument on the petition and the DOT decisionmaker will grant or deny the request without being required to assign reasons therefor.
              
            
            
              Processing Contracts for the Carriage of Mail in Foreign Air Transportation
              
                § 302.718
                Filing.

                § 302.719
                Explanation and data supporting the contract.
                Each contract filed pursuant to this subpart shall be accompanied by economic data and such other information in support of the contract upon which the filing air carrier intends that the Department rely, including, in cases where pertinent, estimates of the annual volume of contract mail (weight and ton-miles) under the proposed contract, the nature of such mail (letter mail, parcel post, third class, etc.), together with a statement as to the extent to which this traffic is new or diverted from existing classes of air and surface mail services and the priority assigned to this class of mail.
              
              
                § 302.720
                Service.
                A copy of each contract filed pursuant to § 302.718, and a copy of all material and data filed pursuant to § 302.719, shall be served upon each of the following persons:
                (a) Each certificated and commuter (as defined in § 298.2 of this chapter) air carrier, other than the contracting carrier, that is actually providing scheduled mail services between any pair of points between which mail is to be transported pursuant to the contract; and
                (b) The Assistant General Counsel, Transportation Division, U.S. Postal Service, Washington, DC 20260-1124.
              
              
                § 302.721
                Complaints.
                Within fifteen (15) days of the filing of a contract, any interested person may file with the Office of Aviation Analysis, X-50, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590, a complaint with respect to the contract setting forth the basis for such complaint and all pertinent information in support of same. A copy of the complaint shall be served upon the air carrier filing the contract and upon each of the persons served with such contract pursuant to § 302.720.
              
              
                § 302.722
                Answers to complaints.
                Answers to the complaint may be filed within ten (10) days of the filing of the complaint, with service being made as provided in § 302.720.
              
              
                
                § 302.723
                Further procedures.
                (a) In any case where a complaint is filed, the DOT decisionmaker shall issue an order dismissing the complaint, disapproving the contract, or taking such other action as may be appropriate. Any such order shall be issued not later than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of the contract.
                (b) In cases where no complaint is filed, the DOT decisionmaker may issue a letter of notification to all persons upon whom the contract was served indicating that the Department does not intend to disapprove the contract.
                (c) Unless the DOT decisionmaker disapproves the contract not later than ten (10) days prior to its effective date, the contract automatically becomes effective.
              
              
                § 302.724
                Petitions for reconsideration.
                Except in the case of a Department determination to disapprove a contract, no petitions for reconsideration of any Department determination pursuant to this subpart shall be entertained.

              (a) Unless specifically exempted by these regulations or by an order of the Assistant Secretary, a person filing an application pursuant to § 303.03 of this part shall prepare and file the application in the manner specified in this section.

              (g) The Assistant Secretary or the Administrative Law Judge may order any applicant to submit information in addition to that required by the applicable subpart.
              (h) An applicant may withhold a document required by this part on the grounds that it is privileged, but each document so withheld shall be identified and the applicant shall supply a brief description of the nature of the document, a written statement indicating the basis of the privilege claimed, and the names of the preparers and recipients of the document. If any interested party contests the assertion of privilege, the document shall be promptly submitted to the Assistant Secretary, or the Administrative Law Judge, if the matter has been assigned to a Judge. Where appropriate, an in camera inspection may be ordered.

              § 303.05
              Applications requesting antitrust immunity.

              (a) Each application must state explicitly whether or not the applicant seeks antitrust immunity under the provisions of section 414 of the Act. If antitrust immunity is requested, the application should specify whether the applicant seeks full immunity or immunity only from the provisions of sections 4, 4a and 4c of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15, 15a, 15c. Each application seeking antitrust immunity shall contain a statement explaining why the applicant believes immunity is in the public interest and necessary in order for the transaction to proceed.
              (b) [Reserved]

              (c) Any material misrepresentation of fact in such an application shall be grounds for rescission nunc pro tunc of any antitrust immunity granted as a result of the misrepresentation.
              (d) A request for renewal of any immunity granted does not operate under section 558 of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 558(c), to extend the period of immunity conferred.

              Review of antitrust immunity.
              The Assistant Secretary may initiate a proceeding to review any antitrust immunity previously conferred by the Civil Aeronautics Board or the Department in any section 412 transaction. The Assistant Secretary may terminate or modify such immunity if the Assistant Secretary finds after notice and hearing that the previously conferred immunity is not consistent with the provisions of section 414. In any proceeding to review such immunity, the proponents of the immunity will have the burden of justifying the continuation of previously conferred immunity under the provisions of section 414.

              § 303.30
              General provisions concerning contents of applications.
              A Section 412 application shall contain the following general information:
              (a) The name, mailing address and primary line of business of each party to the contract, agreement or request for authority to discuss a possible cooperative working arrangement.
              (b) If the contract or agreement for which approval is sought is not evidenced by a resolution of an air carrier association, the application shall contain a copy of the contract or agreement that is certified to be true and complete by each party to the contract of agreement. If the contract or agreement is set forth in an exchange of correspondence, copies of all such correspondence must be submitted and must be certified as true and complete by all parties to the contract or agreement. If the contract or agreement is oral, a memorandum fully describing the agreement must be submitted and must be certified as true and complete by all parties to the contract or agreement. If approval is sought for a request for authority to discuss a possible cooperative working arrangement, the application shall contain a complete description of the possible cooperative working arrangement and all matters to be discussed. The description shall be certified to be true and complete by each party to the proposed discussion.

              (c) If the contract, agreement or request for authority to discuss a cooperative working arrangement is evidenced by a resolution or other action of an air carrier association, the application shall contain the resolution or other action and a certification by an authorized employee of the association that the resolution or other action was duly adopted on a certain date. The authorized employee shall also specify in such certification the name of each air carrier that concurred in such resolution or other action and the name of each air carrier member that did not concur. Contracts, agreements and requests for authority to discuss cooperative working arrangements may be filed in this manner only if the Association has complied with 14 CFR part 263.
            
            
              § 303.31
              Justification for the application.
              A section 412 application shall explain the nature and purpose of the contract, agreement or request to discuss a cooperative working arrangement and describe how it changes any price, rule or practice existing under a previously-approved application. The application also, consistent with Department of Transportation and CAB precedent, shall contain factual material, documentation and argument in support of the application. Economic analyses, when required, shall include full explanatory details, including data sources and allocation methods. If the applicants intend to rely on public benefits to justify approval they shall describe these benefits, including foreign policy and comity considerations.
            
            
              § 303.32
              Service of the application.

              § 303.45
              Evidentiary hearings.
              (a) If the Assistant Secretary determines that an application, or review of a previous granted application, should be the subject of a full evidentiary hearing, he or she shall issue an order so stating. The term “full evidentiary hearing” includes any hybrid format set out in the instituting order. This order shall set forth the issues that are to be considered in such hearing.
              (b) After the issuance of an order for a full evidentiary hearing, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall promptly appoint an Administrative Law Judge to conduct such hearing in accordance with section 7 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 556, and the Rules of Practice in part 302 of this chapter.
              (c) The applicants and the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings shall be parties in any full evidentiary hearing held under these regulations.

              (d) Within the time specified in the order instituting the full evidentiary hearing, the Administrative Law Judge shall recommend to the Assistant Secretary that the application be approved or denied or that the previously granted exemption approval or immunity should be terminated or continued in accordance with the standards of the Act. The recommendation shall be in writing, shall be based solely on the hearing record, and shall include a statement of the Administrative Law Judge's findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefore, or all material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record. Copies of the recommendation shall be served on each party.
              (e) Within 10 days after the date the Administrative Law Judge serves his or her recommendation, any party may file written exceptions to the recommendation for consideration by the Assistant Secretary. Within 21 days after the service date of the judge's recommendation, any party may file a brief in support of or in opposition to any exceptions. This period may be altered by order of the Assistant Secretary, who may also authorize the filing of reply briefs.

            § 305.1
            Applicability.
            The provisions of this part shall govern informal nonpublic investigations, as distinguished from formal investigations and adjudicatory proceedings, undertaken by the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings with a view to obtaining information from any person. While the Department seeks and encourages voluntary cooperation and believes that it is in the best interest of all parties concerned, it will utilize the procedures provided by this part to compel the disclosure of information by any person where DOT wishes to determine whether such person, or any other person, has been or is violating any provisions of Title IV or sections 101(3), 1002, 1003, or 1108(b) of the Act, or any rule, regulation, order, certificate, permit, or letter or registration issued pursuant thereto by DOT and when the information appears to be relevant to the matter under investigation. This part shall not apply to employees or records of other agencies of the U.S. Government, the District of Columbia, or the several States and their political subdivisions.
          
          
            § 305.2
            Definition.
            For the purpose of, and as used in this part, the term investigation means a non-adjudicatory, informal nonpublic investigation for the purpose of determining whether formal enforcement action should be instituted with respect to alleged violations of law.

            § 305.5
            Initiation of investigation.
            An investigation may be initiated by order of the Department. Attorneys of the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings shall conduct such investigations pursuant to the provisions of this part and they shall be designated Investigation Attorneys. Investigation Attorneys, administrative law judges and the DOT decisionmaker are hereby authorized to exercise and perform their duties and functions under this part in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Department.
          
          
            § 305.6
            Appearance of witnesses.

            Witnesses may be required to appear before any administrative law judge for the purpose of receiving their testimony or receiving from them documents or other data relating to any subject under investigation. Such testimony shall be mechanically or stenographically recorded, and a transcript thereof shall be made and incorporated in the record of the investigation.
          
          
            § 305.7

            (a) The Deputy General Counsel, the DOT decisionmaker, the chief administrative law judge or the administrative law judge designated to preside at the reception of evidence, may issue a subpena directing the person named therein to appear before a designated administrative law judge at a designated time and place to testify or to produce documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation, or both. Each such subpena shall briefly advise the person required to testify or submit documentary evidence of the purpose and scope of the investigation, and a copy of the order initiating the investigation shall be attached to the subpena.
            (b) Witnesses subpenaed to appear shall be paid the fees and mileage prescribed in § 302.7 of the Rules of Practice (14 CFR 302.7). Service of such subpenas shall be made in accordance with the provisions of § 302.27(c) of the Rules of Practice (14 CFR 302.27(c)).

            Investigations shall be attended only by the witnesses and their counsel, the administrative law judge, the Investigation Attorney, other DOT personnel concerned with the conduct of the proceeding and the official stenographer. All orders initiating investigations, motions to quash or modify investigation subpenas, orders disposing of such motions, documents, and transcripts of testimony shall be part of the record in the investigation. Unless DOT determines otherwise, all orders initiating investigations which do not disclose the identity of the particular persons of firms under investigation shall be published in the Federal Register. Except as otherwise required by law, the remainder of the record of such proceedings shall constitute internal DOT documents which shall not be available to the general public. The use of such records in DOT proceedings subject to part 302 of the Rules of Practice shall be governed by §§ 302.25(g) and 302.12 and by the law of evidence applicable to DOT proceedings.

            § 305.11
            Procedures after investigation.
            Upon completion of the investigation, where the Deputy General Counsel, determines that no corrective action is warranted, the investigation will be closed, and any documentary evidence obtained in the investigation will be returned to the persons who produced it. Where remedial action is indicated by the investigation, the Deputy General Counsel will proceed pursuant to subpart D of part 302 of the Rules of Practice or will take such other action as may be appropriate.

            § 305.12
            Motions to quash or modify an investigation subpena.

            Any person upon whom an investigation subpena is served may, within seven (7) days after such service or at any time prior to the return date thereof, whichever is earlier, file a motion to quash or modify such subpena with the administrative law judge who issued such subpena, or in the event the administrative law judge is not available, with the chief administrative law judge for action by himself or herself or by the DOT decisionmaker. Such motions shall be made in writing in conformity with Rules 3 and 4 of the Rules of Practice (part 302 of this subchapter); shall state with particularity the grounds therefor and the relief sought; shall be accompanied by the evidence relied upon and all such factual matter shall be verified in accordance with the provisions of Rule 4(b) of the aforesaid Rules of Practice. Written memoranda or briefs may be filed with the motions, stating the points and authorities relied upon. No oral argument will be heard on such motions unless the chief administrative law judge, the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker directs otherwise. A subpena will be quashed or modified if the evidence whose production is required is not reasonably relevant to the matter under investigation, or the demand made does not describe with sufficient particularity the information sought, or the subpena is unlawful or unduly burdensome. The filing of a motion to quash or modify an investigation subpena shall stay the return date of such subpena until such motion is granted or denied. The DOT decisionmaker may at any time review, upon his or her own initiative, the ruling of an administrative law judge or the chief administrative law judge denying a motion to quash a subpena. In such cases, the DOT decisionmaker may order that the return date of a subpena which he or she has elected to review be stayed pending DOT action thereon.

            § 313.1
            Purpose, scope, and authority.
            (a) Chapter 77 (Energy Conservation) of Title 42 (The Public Health and Welfare), authorizes and directs certain actions to conserve energy supplies through energy conservation programs and where necessary, the regulation of certain energy uses, and to provide for improved energy efficiency of motor vehicles, major appliances, and certain other consumer products. In furtherance of these purposes, 42 U.S.C. 6362 requires several transportation regulatory agencies, including DOT, to submit a number of reports to the Congress with respect to energy conservation and efficiency, and where practicable and consistent with the exercise of DOT's authority under other law, to include in any major regulatory action a statement of its probable impact on energy efficiency and energy conservation. 42 U.S.C. 6362(b) directs DOT to define the term “major regulatory action” by rule.
            (b) Section 40113 of Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation)(“the Statute”), authorizes DOT to establish such rules, regulations, and procedures as are necessary to the exercise of its functions and are consistent with the purposes of the Statute.
            (c) The purpose of these regulations is to establish procedures and guidelines for the implementation of DOT's responsibility under 42 U.S.C. 6362 to include in any major regulatory action taken by DOT a statement of the probable impact on energy efficiency and energy conservation.
            (d) These regulations apply to all proceedings before DOT, as provided herein.
            [Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2425, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43528, 43529, Aug. 22, 1995]
          
          
            § 313.2
            Policy.
            (a) General. It is the policy of DOT to view the conservation of energy and the energy efficiency improvement goals of Chapter 77 of Title 42 as part of DOT's overall mandate, to be considered along with the several public interest and public convenience and necessity factors enumerated in section 40101 of the Statute. To the extent practicable and consistent with DOT's authority under the Statute and other law, energy conservation and efficiency are to be weighed in the decisionmaking process just as are DOT's traditional policies and missions.
            (b) Implementation. Implementation of this policy is through the integration of energy findings and conclusions into decisions, opinions, or orders in proceedings involving a major regulatory action, as defined in this part.
            (c) Proceedings in progress. The provisions of this part are intended primarily for prospective application. Proceedings in progress on the effective date of this part, in which an application has been docketed but no final decision made public, shall adhere to § 313.6(a) of this part, provided that the fair, efficient, and timely administration of DOT's regulatory activities is not compromised thereby. Nothing herein shall imply a requirement for new or additional hearings, a reopening of the record, or any other procedures which would tend to delay a timely decision in proceedings in progress.
            (d) Hearings. Public hearings will not normally be held for the purpose of implementing 42 U.S.C. 6362, particularly in connection with proposed actions which do not require notice and hearing as a prerequisite to decision under the Statute. Hearings may be ordered in exceptional circumstances where the proposed action is of great magnitude or widespread public interest and, in addition, presents complex issues peculiarly subject to resolution through evidentiary hearings and the process of cross-examination.

            (a) Energy efficiency means the ratio of the useful output of services in air transportation to the energy consumption of such services.
            (b) Energy statement is a statement of the probable impact of a major regulatory action on energy efficiency and energy conservation, contained in a decision, opinion, order, or rule.
            (c) Major regulatory action is any decision by the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge requiring an energy statement pursuant to § 313.4 of this part.
            (d) NEPA means the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
            (e) Statute means Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation).

            § 313.4
            Major regulatory actions.
            (a) Any initial, recommended, tentative or final decision, opinion, order, or final rule is a major regulatory action requiring an energy statement, if it:
            (1) May cause a near-term net annual change in aircraft fuel consumption of 10 million (10,000,000) gallons or more, compared to the probable consumption of fuel were the action not to be taken; or
            (2) Is specifically so designated by DOT because of its precedential value, substantial controversy with respect to energy conservation and efficiency, or other unusual circumstances.
            (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the following types of actions shall not be deemed as major regulatory actions requiring an energy statement:
            (1) Tariff suspension orders under section 41509 of the Statute, emergency exemptions or temporary exemptions not exceeding 24 months under section 40109 of the Statute and other proceedings in which timely action is of the essence;
            (2) Orders instituting or declining to institute investigations or rulemaking, setting or declining to set applications for hearing, on reconsideration, or on requests for stay;
            (3) Other procedural or interlocutory orders;
            (4) Actions taken under delegated authority; and
            (5) Issuance of a certificate where no determination of public convenience and necessity is required.

            (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, DOT may provide that an energy statement shall not be prepared in a proceeding which may result in a major regulatory action, if it finds that:
            
            (1) The inclusion of an energy statement is not consistent with the exercise of DOT's authority under the Statute or other law;
            (2) The inclusion of an energy statement is not practicable because of time constraints, lack of information, or other unusual circumstances; or
            (3) The action is taken under laws designed to protect the public health or safety.
            [Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2425, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43529, Aug. 22, 1995]
          
          
            § 313.5
            Energy information.
            (a) It shall be the responsibility of applicants and other parties or participants to a proceeding which may involve a major regulatory action to submit sufficient information about the energy consumption and energy efficiency consequences of their proposals or positions in the proceeding to enable the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, as the case may be, to determine whether the proceeding will in fact involve a major regulatory action for purposes of this part, and if so, to consider the relevant energy factors in the decision and prepare the energy statement.
            (b) In proceedings involving evidentiary hearings, the energy information shall be submitted at such hearings pursuant to DOT's usual procedural regulations and practices, under control of the administrative law judge or other hearing officer.
            (c) In proceedings not involving evidentiary hearings, the energy information shall be submitted at such time as other materials in justification of an application are submitted. Where an application itself is intended as justification for DOT action, the energy information shall be submitted with the application. In rulemakings not involving hearings, the energy information shall normally be submitted along with comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking, or as directed in any such notice or any advance notice.
          
          
            § 313.6
            Energy statements.
            (a) Each major regulatory action shall include, to the extent practicable, consideration of the probable impact of the action taken or to be taken upon energy efficiency and conservation. The administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, as the case may be, shall normally make findings and conclusions about:
            (1) The net change in energy consumption;
            (2) The net change in energy efficiency; and
            (3) The balance struck between energy factors and other public interest and public convenience and necessity factors in the decision.
            (b) Energy findings and conclusions contained in any initial or recommended decision are a part of that decision and thus subject to discretionary review by DOT.
            (c) In the case of orders to show cause initiated by DOT, energy findings and conclusions may be omitted if adequate information is not available. In such instances, the energy statement shall be integrated into the final decision.
          
          
            § 313.7
            Integration with environmental procedures.
            (a) In proceedings in which an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact is prepared by a responsible official pursuant to DOT's procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the energy information called for by this part may be included in that statement or declaration in order to yield a single, comprehensive document. In such instances, the DOT's NEPA procedures shall govern the submission of the energy information. However, it shall remain the responsibility of the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, as the case may be, to make the findings and conclusions required by § 313.6(a) of this part.
            (b) A determination that a major regulatory action within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 6362 and this part may be involved in a proceeding is independent from any determination that the proceeding is a “major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” within the meaning of NEPA, and vice versa.

            § 323.1
            Applicability.
            This part applies to certificated air carriers who terminate or suspend service to a point, or in a market, and to all air carriers who terminate, suspend, or reduce service below the level of essential air service under 49 U.S.C. 41731-41742.

            § 323.2
            Definitions.
            As used in this part:
            
              Certificated carrier means a direct air carrier holding authority to provide air transportation granted by the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) or the former Civil Aeronautics Board (“CAB”) in the form of a certificate of public convenience and necessity under section 41102 of the Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation) (“the Statute”) or an all-cargo air transportation certificate to perform all-cargo air transportation under section 41103 of the Statute.
            
              Eligible place means a place in the United States that—
            (1) Was an eligible point under section 419 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 as in effect before October 1, 1988;
            (2) Received scheduled air transportation at any time between January 1, 1990, and November 4, 1990; and
            (3) Is not listed in Department of Transportation Orders 89-9-37 and 89-12-52 as a place ineligible for compensation under Subchapter II of Chapter 417 of the Statute. (For availability of Department of Transportation Orders, see 49 CFR part 7, subpart E and appendix A.)
            
              Essential air service is that air transportation which the Department has found to be essential under Subchapter II of Chapter 417 of the Statute.
            
              FAA means the Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation.
            
              FAA-designated hub means any airport serving a small, medium, or large air traffic hub listed in the Department of Transportation publication, Airport Activity Statistics of Certificated Route Carriers.
            
            
              Statute means Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation).
            
              United States includes the several States, the District of Columbia, and the several territories and possessions of the United States. State includes any of the individual entities comprising the United States.

            § 323.3
            Who shall file notices.
            (a) Terminations, suspensions, or reductions by certificated carriers. The notice described in § 323.4(a) shall be filed by any certificated carrier that intends to:

            (1) Terminate or suspend all passenger air transportation that it is providing to any eligible place in the United States when that termination or suspension will leave no certificated carriers serving that place. Service shall be considered to be terminated or suspended whenever it is operated less than 5 days per week, with three or more intermediate stops, or in one direction only between the two places;
            
            (2) Reduce passenger air transportation so that any eligible place receives less than the level of essential air service determined by DOT;
            (3) Terminate or suspend all passenger air transportation that it is providing to any eligible place in the United States for which DOT has not issued an essential air service determination under either § 325.5 or § 325.7 of this chapter, when that termination or suspension will leave only one certificated carrier serving that place. Service shall be considered to be terminated or suspended whenever it is operated less than 5 days per week, with three or more intermediate stops, or in one direction only between the two places;
            (4) Reduce passenger air transportation to any eligible place in Alaska for which DOT has not determined the level of essential air service so that the service between that place and every other place served by a certificated carrier is either:
            (i) Less than two round trip flights per week, or
            (ii) Less than the average weekly number of round trip flights actually provided during calendar year 1976, or
            (iii) Less than the number of flights specified under an agreement between DOT and the State of Alaska; or
            (5) Terminate, suspend, or reduce passenger air transportation at an eligible place for which DOT has issued, or is required to issue, an essential air service determination under section 41731 or section 41733 of the Statute so that the total available seats of all the carriers linking that place to FAA-designated hubs will be reduced by 33 percent or more during a 90-day period. Service to a hub shall be considered to be terminated or suspended whenever it is operated less than 5 days per week, with three or more intermediate stops, or in one direction only between two places.
            (b) [Reserved]
            (c) Uncertificated carriers. The notice described in § 323.4(a) shall be filed by any uncertificated carrier that intends to terminate, suspend, or reduce:
            (1) Air transportation so that any eligible place receives less than the level of essential air service determined by the DOT;
            (2) Passenger air transportation to any eligible place for which DOT has not determined the level of essential air service, other than a place in Alaska, so that there is no FAA-designated hub from which the place receives at least two round trip flights per day, 5 days per week; or
            (3) Passenger air transportation to any eligible place in Alaska, for which DOT has not determined the level of essential air service, so that the service between that place and every other place served by a certificated carrier is either:
            (i) Less than two round trip flights per week, or
            (ii) Less than the average number of weekly round trip flights actually provided during calendar year 1976, or
            (iii) Less than the number of flights specified under an agreement between DOT and the State of Alaska.
            (d) For the purpose of this section, in ascertaining the level of air transportation being provided to a place or between two places, air transportation that has been the subject of a notice filed under this section shall be considered not in operation for the duration of the notice period.
            (e) If a certificated carrier was, before October 24, 1978, granted authority to suspend air transportation, and that authority ends on a stated date, the carrier shall comply with the requirements of this part before continuing the suspension beyond that date.
            (f) If a certificated carrier was, before October 24, 1978, granted authority to terminate or suspend air transportation, but has not suspended service, the carrier shall comply with the requirements of this part before terminating or suspending service.

            (iii) Routes of the flights to be discontinued, and a statement of which routes, if any, will be left without nonstop or single-plane service from a certificated carrier by the intended change, and
            (iv) Date of intended termination, suspension, or reduction of service.
            (5) A statement whether DOT has determined the level of essential air service for the point, and
            (i) If such a determination has been made, a statement whether the intended termination, suspension, or reduction will reduce air transportation to the place below the essential level; or
            (ii) If such a determination has not been made, and the place is an eligible place, a statement whether the intended termination, suspension, or reduction reasonably appears to deprive the place of essential air service, and an explanation.
            (6) If the place is an eligible place, the calendar date when objections are due under § 323.10.
            (7) Proof of service upon all persons specified in § 323.7(a). The proof of service shall include the names of all carriers served and the names and addresses of all other persons served.

            § 323.14
            Temporary suspension authority for involuntary interruption of service.
            (a) Any air carrier may temporarily suspend service without filing a notice under § 323.3 for any interruption of service that the carrier cannot reasonably be expected to foresee or control, such as rules, standards, or other action, or inaction, of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration or of a foreign government, emergency measures, strikes, weather conditions, construction work on airports, or disasters. However, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply to interruptions due to airport inadequacies only if the carrier is unable to serve the place through any airport convenient to the place with the type of equipment last regularly used to serve the place.
            (b) In the case of an interruption of service caused by a strike, the carrier shall give immediate notice of the interruption to DOT. Suspension authority under this section due to a strike shall expire 90 days after employees return to work.
            (c) If service to a place is interrupted for more than 3 consecutive days for reasons beyond the carrier's control other than a strike, the holder shall give notice to DOT within 3 days following the date of first interruption, setting forth the date of first interruption and a full statement of the reasons for the interruption.
            (d) The notice required by paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall be marked for the attention of the Director, Office of Aviation Analysis.

            Report to be filed after strikes.
            (a) Within 15 days following resumption of service after a strike, an air carrier shall file a report with DOT containing a list of all flights that were canceled, the date they were canceled, and the date service was resumed.

            Each air carrier filing a notice under § 323.3 (a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(5), or (c) shall continue to list the affected flights in all generally-distributed schedule publications in which the flight was listed before the notice. The listings shall continue until DOT permits the flights to be discontinued. The listings may include a notice stating that the flights are “to be discontinued as of (date) subject to government approval.”
          
          
            § 323.17
            Delays in discontinuing service.
            If transportation that is the subject of a notice under this part is not discontinued within 90 days of the intended date stated in the notice, a new notice must be filed before the service may be discontinued. However, if DOT requires the carrier to provide service beyond the stated date, the carrier need not file a new notice if it discontinues the service within 90 days after DOT permits it to do so.
          
          
            § 323.18
            Carriers' obligations when terminating, suspending, or reducing air service.
            Any air carrier that terminates, suspends, or reduces air service, whether or not subject to the notice requirements of this part, shall make reasonable efforts to contact all passengers holding reservations on the affected flights to inform them of the flights' cancellation.
          
          
            § 323.19
            Withdrawal notice by exemption carriers in certain limited-entry markets.
            As a condition on the exemption, an air carrier operating under exemption authority in an international market which is the subject of a carrier selection proceeding shall file a notice with the Department at least ninety days before it terminates service in that market. Once such a notice has been filed, the carrier may not terminate service in that market during the notice period unless the air carrier chosen in the selection proceeding enters the market and the Department grants the operating carrier permission to do so. The Department may allow earlier termination for good cause when in the public interest.

            § 325.1
            Purpose.
            The purpose of this part is to establish procedures to be followed in designating eligible points and in determining essential air transportation levels for eligible points, and in the appeals and periodic reviews of these determinations, under section 419 of the Act.
          
          
            § 325.2
            Applicability.

            This part applies to essential air service determinations for communities designated as eligible under section 419(a) of the Act and to eligible point designations and essential air service determinations for communities that qualify under section 419(b) of the Act. It applies to the gathering of data by the Department, and to the participation of State, local, and other officials and other interested persons in the designation and determination processes.
            
            
              Note:
              Criteria for designating eligible points under section 419(b) are contained in part 270 of this chapter. Guidelines for deciding essential air service levels are contained in part 398 of this chapter.
            
          
          
            § 325.3
            Definitions.
            As used in this part, eligible point means:

            (a) Any point in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the several territories and possessions of the United States to which any direct air carrier was authorized, under a certificate issued by CAB under section 401 of the Act, to provide air service on October 24, 1978, whether or not such service was actually provided;
            (b) Any point in the United States and the several territories and possessions of the United States that was deleted from a section 401 certificate between July 1, 1968 and October 24, 1978, inclusive, and that has been designated as an eligible point under the Act; or
            (c) Any other point in Alaska or Hawaii that has been designated as an eligible point under the Act.
          
          
            § 325.4
            State and local participation.
            (a) DOT, on a periodic basis, will send a questionnaire to each eligible point that is served by not more than one certificated air carrier, or is designated as an eligible point under section 419(b) of the Act, or for which DOT is reviewing its essential air service needs. The questionnaire will be addressed to:
            (1) The chief executive of the principal city, or other unit of local government at the affected point, that is named or has been previously named in a qualifying section 401 certificate. For points in Alaska or Hawaii that are named DOT as eligible points without having been listed on a section 401 certificate, the principal city is the most populous municipality at the point;
            (2) The individual or entity with direct supervision over and responsibility for the airport at the eligible point; and
            (3) The State agency with jurisdiction over air transportation in the State containing the eligible point. If there is no such State agency, the questionnaire will be sent to the governor of that State.
            (b) Within 60 days after receipt of the questionnaire, five copies of the response shall be filed in the Documentary Services Division, unless the Department specifies another date. If no response is received within the period, essential air service for that eligible point may temporarily be set at the minimum level prescribed in section 419(f) of the Act.
            (c) Any other interested person may, during the 60-day response period, submit information relevant to the essential air service level of that eligible point by filing in the Documentary Services Division, five copies of a document titled with the name of the point involved.
            (d) As necessary, the DOT may request additional information to supplement the questionnaire.

            § 325.5
            Determinations and designations.
            (a) Not later than October 24, 1979, after reviewing all information submitted, CAB issued determinations of the essential level of air service for eligible points that, on October 24, 1978, were served by not more than one direct air carrier holding a certificate under section 401 of the Act for scheduled service to the point.
            (b) DOT will issue a determination of the essential level of air service for a point within 6 months after each of the following events:
            (1) A notice is received that service to an eligible point will be reduced to only one carrier that holds a section 401 certificate;
            (2) A point is designated as an eligible point under section 419(b) of the Act and either paragraph (c) of this section, paragraph (d) of this section, or § 325.7(e); or
            (3) A review was conducted of essential air service of that point under § 325.6.
            (c) Not later than January 1, 1982, CAB designated the communities described in § 270.2(a) and (b) as eligible points or as ineligible.
            (d) After January 1, 1982, DOT may designate communities in Alaska or Hawaii as eligible points if they apply for such designation.
          
          
            § 325.6
            Periodic reviews.

            (a) The Department will start a periodic review of essential air service within 1 year of the date of the previous determination of essential air service for eligible points receiving subsidized service, within 2 years of the date of the previous determination for eligible points in Alaska, and within 3 years of the date of the previous determination for eligible points without subsidized air service.
            
            (b) The review shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures in §§ 325.4, 325.5 and 325.7.
            (c) The Department may review the designation under section 419(b) of a community as an eligible point to determine whether that point continues to meet the criteria in part 270 of this chapter.

            (a) Any person may file with DOT a petition titled “Petition for Modification of Essential Air Service Level,” asking to modify the essential air service level at a point.
            (b) The petition shall identify the point affected, and specifically state the reasons why the petitioner believes the designated essential level is inadequate. It should contain any facts and arguments that support its requests, and describe the level of essential air service that should be substituted.
            (c) Any person may, within 30 days after the filing of a petition for modification, file an answer to that petition titled “Answer to Petition for Modification.”
            (d) After review, the Department may seek more information and the procedures of §§ 325.5 and 325.7 will be followed.

              What is the purpose of this part?
              The purpose of this part is to establish procedures to implement section 101(a)(2) of the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (“the Act”), Public Law 107-42, 115 Stat. 230 (49 U.S.C. 40101 note). This statutory provision is intended to compensate air carriers for direct losses incurred as a result of the Federal ground stop order issued by the Secretary of Transportation, and any subsequent orders, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and incremental losses incurred from September 11 through December 31, 2001, as the result of those attacks.

                Regional air carrier means an air carrier that operates at least one large aircraft and has annual operating revenues of less than $100 million.
              
                Revenue ton-miles (RTMs) means the aircraft miles flown on each flight stage by the air carrier multiplied by the number of tons of revenue cargo transported on that stage. For purposes of this part, RTMs include only those resulting from all-cargo flights.
            
            
              § 330.5
              What funds will the Department distribute under this part?

              Under this part, the Department will distribute up to the full amount of the compensation it determines is payable to air carriers under section 103(b) of the Act, and up to the full amount of the set-aside provided for in subpart C of this part to air carriers eligible for it. The Department may require additional information to support payments to individual carriers in connection with this final payment.

              § 330.9
              What are the limits on compensation to air carriers?
              (a) You are eligible to receive compensation equaling the lesser of your direct and incremental losses or the amount calculated by the formula set forth in section 103(b)(2) of the Act.

              (b) If at any time we determine that a carrier has been compensated in an amount that exceeds the amount to which it is entitled under section 103(b) of the Act or the subpart C set-aside program, the Department will notify the carrier of the basis for the determination, the amount that must be repaid, and the procedures to follow for making a repayment. We will follow collection procedures under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.,) to the extent required by law, in recovering such overpayments. This process will also apply to collection of overpayments by the Department as a result of an audit by representatives of the Department, including the Office of the Inspector General, or the Comptroller General under section 103 of the Act, which may be the subject of a separate collection action.
            
            
              § 330.11
              Which carriers are eligible to apply for compensation under this part?
              (a) If you are a certificated air carrier, a commuter air carrier, an air taxi, or an indirect air carrier, you are eligible to apply for compensation under subpart B of this part.
              (b) [Reserved]

              § 330.25
              What are the components of an air carrier's application for compensation?
              As an air carrier applying for compensation under this part, you must provide to the Department all materials described in §§ 330.27-330.33. The Department will not accept your application if it does not comply fully with the requirements of this subpart.
            
            
              § 330.27
              What information must certificated and commuter air carriers submit?
              (a) You must submit Form 330 (Final), found in appendix A to this part. Data supplied on Form 330 (Final) in appendix A to this part must be tied only to the airline portion of their businesses and must exclude non-air transportation related expenses.
              (b) [Reserved]
              
              (c) Air carriers that operate both passenger/combination aircraft and all-cargo aircraft and routinely report to the Department ASMs and RTMs separately for both types of flights must submit two versions of Form 330 (Final) in appendix A to this part to seek compensation on both an ASM and RTM basis. Financial and operational data (both actual and forecasted) must be disaggregated and correlate exclusively to one or the other type of operation.
              (d) You must include the following financial information on Form 330 (Final) for the period September 11, 2001 through December 31, 2001:
              (1) Your pre-September 11, 2001, profit/loss forecast for the period beginning September 11, 2001, and ending December 31, 2001. This forecast must reflect seasonal reductions in capacity and the cost savings associated with such reductions. Documentation verifying that the pre-September 11, 2001, forecast was, in fact, completed before that date must also be submitted with your application.
              (2) Your actual results for that same period reflecting any losses that were a direct result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. These actual results must incorporate all cost reductions associated with capacity reductions and furloughs you made due to the reduced demand for air service after the September 11th attacks (e.g., employee pay adjustments and furloughs, changes in aircraft fleet in service, schedule and capacity changes, etc.).

              (3) The difference between your forecast profits/losses and actual results for that period (i.e., the difference between the figures in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section).
              (4) The actual losses you report must be net losses, before taxes, taking into account savings from such items as reductions in passenger and cargo handling costs, fuel consumption, landing fees, revenue/traffic-related expenses (e.g., commissions, food and beverage, booking fees, credit card fees), and savings of other costs due to the ground stop and subsequent schedule/capacity/staff reductions (including savings from layoffs of employees, adjusted for severance payments), as well as proceeds from business recovery insurance or other insurance payments. You must not report as losses insurance premium increases that have been or will be compensated by the Government under the Act, or other losses that have been or will be compensated by other subsidies or assistance provided by Federal, state, or local governments.
            
            
              § 330.29
              What information must air taxi operators submit on Form 330 (Final) and Form 330-C?
              As an air taxi operator, you must complete Form 330 (Final) in accordance with the requirements in § 330.27. You must also complete pages 2, 5, and 6 (certifying pages 2 and 5) of Form 330-C as shown in appendix C to this part. Explanatory notes are included on that Form.
            
            
              § 330.31
              What data must air carriers submit concerning ASMs or RTMs?
              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if you are applying for compensation as a passenger or combination passenger/cargo carrier, you must have submitted your August 2001 total completed ASM report to the Department for your system-wide air service (e.g., scheduled, non-scheduled, foreign, and domestic).
              (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if you are applying for compensation as an all-cargo carrier, you must have submitted your RTM reports to the Department for the second calendar quarter of 2001.
              (c) In calculating and submitting ASMs and RTMs under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, there are certain things you must not do:
              (1) Except at the direction of the Department, or to correct an error that you document to the Department, you must not alter the ASM or RTM reports you earlier submitted to the Department. Your ASMs or RTMs for purposes of this part are as you have reported them to the Department according to existing standards, requirements, and methodologies established by the Office of Airline Information (Bureau of Transportation Statistics).

              (2) You must not include ASMs or RTMs resulting from operations by your code-sharing or alliance partners.
              
              (d) If you have not previously reported ASMs or RTMs as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for a given operation or operations, you may submit your calculation of ASMs or RTMs to the Department with your application. You must certify the accuracy of this calculation and submit with your application the data and assumptions on which the calculation is based. After reviewing your submission, the Department may modify or reject your calculation.

              (1) If you are a direct air carrier that has operated your aircraft for a lessee (i.e., a wet lease, or aircraft, crew, maintenance, and insurance (ACMI) operation), you may submit your calculation of ASMs or RTMs for these flights. Your submission must include the following elements:
              (i) Documentation that you otherwise qualify as an air carrier;
              (ii) Documentation that you are a wet lessor, and an explanation of why you did not previously report ASMs or RTMs for the operations in question;
              (iii) Documentation of the identify of the wet lessees involved in these operations; and
              (iv) Accurate and auditable records of ASMs or RTMs actually flown during the relevant time period for these operations.
              (2) If you are an indirect air carrier, you may submit your calculation of ASMs or RTMs for flights that direct air carriers have operated for you under contract or other arrangement. Your submission must include the following elements:
              (i) Documentation that you otherwise qualify as an air carrier;
              (ii) Documentation that you are an indirect air carrier, and an explanation of why you did not previously report ASMs or RTMs for the operations in question;
              (iii) Documentation of the identify of the direct air carriers involved in these operations; and
              (iv) Accurate and auditable records of ASMs or RTMs actually flown during the relevant time period for these operations.
            
            
              § 330.33
              Must carriers certify the truth and accuracy of data they submit?
              Yes, with respect to all information submitted or retained under §§ 330.27-330.31 and 330.35, your Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), or Chief Operating Officer (COO) or, if those titles are not used, the equivalent officer, must certify that the submitted information was prepared under his or her supervision and is true and accurate, under penalty of law.
            
            
              § 330.35
              What records must carriers retain?
              As an air carrier that applies for compensation under this part, you must retain records as follows:
              (a) You must retain all books, records, and other source and summary documentation supporting your claims for compensation of direct and incremental losses pursuant to Sections 101, 103, and 106 of the Act. This requirement includes, but is not limited to, the following:
              (1) You must retain supporting evidence and documentation demonstrating the validity of the data you provide under §§ 330.27-330.31.
              (2) You must retain documentation verifying that your pre-September 11, 2001, forecast was the most recent forecast available to that date.
              (3) You must also retain documentation outlining the assumptions made for all forecasts and the source of the data and other inputs used in making the forecasts.
              (4) You must agree to have your independent public accountant retain all reports, working papers, and supporting documentation pertaining to the agreed-upon procedures engagement conducted by your independent public accountant under the requirements of this part for a period of five years. The accountant must make this information available for audit and examination by representatives of the Department of Transportation (including the Office of the Inspector General), the Comptroller General of the United States, or other Federal agencies.

              (b) You must preserve and maintain this documentation in a manner that readily permits its audit and examination by representatives of the Department of Transportation (including the Office of the Inspector General), the Comptroller General of the United States, or other Federal agencies.
              (c) You must retain this documentation for five years.
              (d) You must make all requested data available within one week from a request by the Department of Transportation (including the Office of the Inspector General), the Comptroller General of the United States, or other Federal agencies.
            
            
              § 330.37
              Are carriers which participate in this program subject to audit?
              (a) All payments you receive from the Department of Transportation under this program are subject to audit. All information you submit with your applications and all records and documentation that you retain are also subject to audit.
              (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, before you are eligible to receive payment from the final installment of compensation under the Act, there must be an independent public accountant's report based on the performance of procedures agreed upon by the Department of Transportation with respect to the carrier's forecasts and actual results. The independent public accountant's engagement must be performed in accordance with generally accepted professional standards applicable to agreed-upon procedures engagements. You must submit the results of the agreed-upon procedures engagement to the Department with your application for payment of the final installment.
              (c) The following are the core requirements for the independent public accountant's review:
              (1) Determine that the earnings forecast presented to the Department was inclusive of the entity's full operations as an air carrier and was the most current forecast prepared prior to September 11, 2001;
              (2) Determine that, if forecasts presented to the Department for prior periods had material variances from actual results, the carrier provided explanations to account for such variances;
              (3) Determine that the methodology for allocating revenue and expenses to the periods September 1-10 and September 11-30, from the forecasted and actual September results, was in accordance with air carrier records and analyses;
              (4) Determine that the actual expenses and revenues presented to the Department are in accordance with the official accounting records of the carrier or the financial statements included in the carrier's Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q (for availability, see 17 CFR 249.0-1(b)), and consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), except to the extent that GAAP would require or allow treatment that would be inconsistent with the Act or this part;
              (5) Verify that the carrier provided explanations supporting the allocation methodology used if the forecasted and/or actual results for the September 11-30 period was different from allocating 66.7 percent of the total amounts for September;
              (6) Determine that the carrier provided full explanations for all material differences between forecast and actual results for the September 11-30, 2001 period and the October 1—December 31, 2001 period;
              (7) Determine that the amounts included in management's explanations for such material differences were in accordance with the carrier's analysis of such fluctuations, and the amounts and explanations were traceable to supporting general ledger accounting records or analyses prepared by the carrier;

              (8) Determine that the amounts presented to the Department in Form 330 (Final), pages 2-3, in appendix A to this part that the carrier identified as adjustments to the difference between the pre-September 11 forecast and actual results for the period September 11 through December 31, 2001, were in accordance with the official accounting records of the carrier or the financial statements included in the carrier's Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q, and consistent with GAAP, except to the extent that GAAP would require or allow treatment that would be inconsistent with the Act or this part;
              
              (9) Determine that the insurance recoveries and government payments reported by the air carrier and offsetting income were in accordance with the air carrier's general ledger accounting records;
              (10) Determine that the information presented in the air carrier's Supplemental Certification were in accordance with the air carrier's general ledger accounting records;
              (11) Include in the auditor's report full documentation for each exception taken by the auditor; and
              (12) Identify air carrier reports and records utilized in performing the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (11) of this section.
              (d) If you are a carrier that reported fewer than 10 million ASMs for the month of August 2001 or fewer than two million RTMs for the quarter ending June 30, 2001, you are not required to report to the Department on the basis of an agreed-upon procedures engagement by an independent public accountant. Instead, you may report on the basis of simplified procedures approved by the Department.
            
            
              § 330.39
              What are examples of types of losses that the Department does not allow?
              (a)(1) The Department generally does not allow air carriers to include in their calculations aircraft impairment charges, charges or expenses attributable to lease buyouts, or other losses that are not actually and fully realized in the period between September 11, 2001 and December 31, 2001.
              (2) The Department will consider requests to accept adjustments for extraordinary or non-recurring expenses or revenues on a case-by-case basis. If, as a carrier, you make such a request, you must demonstrate the following to the satisfaction of the Department:
              (i) That the expense or revenue was (or was not, as appropriate) the direct result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001;
              (ii) That the revenue or expense was reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), except to the extent that the GAAP would require or allow treatment that would be inconsistent with the Act or this part;
              (iii) That an expense was fully borne within the September 11—December 31, 2001, period and is permanent; and
              (iv) That the resulting additional compensation would not be duplicative of other allowances for compensation.
              (b) The Department generally does not accept claims by air carriers that cost savings should be excluded from the calculation of incurred losses. Consequently, the Department will generally not allow such claims to be used in a way that has the effect of increasing the compensation for which an air carrier is eligible.
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Set-Aside for Certain Carriers
            
              § 330.41
              What funds is the Department setting aside for eligible classes of air carriers?
              The Department is setting aside a sum of up to $35 million to compensate eligible classes of air carriers, for which application of a distribution formula containing ASMs as a factor, as set forth in section 103(b)(2) of the Act, would inadequately reflect their share of direct and incremental losses.
            
            
              § 330.43
              What classes of air carriers are eligible under the set-aside?
              There are two classes of eligible air carriers:
              (a) You are a Class I air carrier if you are an air taxi, regional, commuter or indirect air carrier and you reported 75,000 or fewer ASMs to the Department for the month of August, 2001.
              (b) You are a Class II air carrier if you are an air taxi, regional, commuter or indirect air carrier and you reported between 75,001 and 10 million ASMs to the Department for the month of August 2001.
              [Doc. No. DOT-OST-2001-10885, 67 FR 54066, Aug. 20, 2002, as amended at 68 FR 44458, July 29, 2003]
            
            
              § 330.45
              What is the basis on which air carriers will be compensated under the set-aside?

              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, as an air carrier eligible for compensation through the set-aside, you will be compensated for an amount calculated as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
              
              (b)(1) As a Class I carrier, your compensation will be calculated using a fixed ASM rate equivalent to the mean losses per ASM for all Class I carriers applying for compensation.
              (2) As a Class II carrier, your compensation will be calculated using a graduated ASM rate equivalent to—
              (i) The mean loss per ASM for all Class I carriers applying for compensation, for each of the first 75,000 ASMs reported; and
              (ii) The mean remaining loss per ASM for all Class II carriers applying for compensation for each ASM in excess of 75,000.
              (3) For purposes of this paragraph (b), ASMs are those verified by the Department for August 2001.
              (4) Any compensation payments previously made to air carriers eligible for the set-aside will be deducted from the amount calculated as the carrier's total compensation under the set-aside formula.
              (c) If you are an air carrier whose compensation is calculated using an ASM rate as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, your compensation will not be less than an amount equivalent to 25 percent of the direct and incremental transportation-related losses you have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Department were incurred as a direct result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Your compensation will not be more than an amount equivalent to the mean percentage of compensation for losses received by passenger and combination air carriers that are not eligible for the set-aside funds, unless you would have been compensated for more than that percentage of losses under the formula set forth in section 103(b)(2) of the Act, in which case you will be compensated under that formula.

              § 372.24
              Surety bond, depository agreement, escrow agreement.
              (a) Before selling or offering to sell, soliciting or advertising any charter flight, a charter operator shall comply with one of the three following requirements:

              (1) The charter operator shall furnish a surety bond in an amount not less than the maximum fare held out for charter flights proposed to be operated during each calendar month multiplied by 90 percent of the number of available seats on such flights: Provided, however, That the liability of the surety to any charter participant shall not exceed the charter operator's applicable tariff fare. Such bond shall be filed with the Department not less than 45 days prior to the commencement of the calendar month covered by the bond together with a list of flights proposed to be operated during the month showing charter price, departure dates, equipment to be used for each flight and the seating capacity: Provided, however, That the amount of the bond shall be increased if additional charter flights are proposed or may be reduced if proposed charter flights are canceled, in which event a substitute bond and amended list of proposed flights shall be filed with the Department within 10 days of the date that the charter operator adds flights or cancels flights previously proposed, but in no event later than 2 days prior to the operation of any such additional charter flights; or
              (2) The charter operator shall:

              (i) Furnish and file with the Department a surety bond in the amount of $100,000 for the protection of the charter participants: Provided, however, That the liability of the surety to any charter participant shall not exceed the charter operator's applicable tariff fare; and
              (ii) Enter into an agreement with a bank, the terms of which shall include the following:
              (a) Each participant shall pay for his deposit and subsequent payments comprising the charter participant's tariff fare only by check or money order payable to such bank which shall maintain a separate accounting for each flight: Provided, however, That if the participant makes a cash deposit, the charter operator who receives such cash deposit shall forthwith remit to the designated bank a check for the full amount of the deposit;
              (b) The bank shall not pay the air carrier or foreign air carrier the charter price for the transportation earlier than 60 days (including day of departure) prior to the scheduled day of departure of the originating or returning flight, upon certification of the departure date and price by the charter operator;
              (c) The bank shall reimburse the charter operator for refunds made by the latter to the participants upon written notification from the charter operator;
              (d) If the charter operator notifies the bank that a flight has been canceled, the bank shall make the applicable refunds directly to the participants;
              (e) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(c) of this section, the bank shall not pay any funds from the account to the charter operator prior to 2 banking days after completion of each flight when the balance in the account shall be paid to the charter operator upon certification of the completion date by the charter operator and direct air carrier;
              (f) Notwithstanding any provisions above, the amount of total cash deposits required to be maintained in the depository account of the bank may be reduced by one or both of the following: The amount of surety bond in the form prescribed herein in excess of the minimum bond required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section; an escrow with the designated bank of Federal, State, or municipal bonds or other securities, consisting of certificates of deposit issued by banks having a stated policy of redeeming such certificates before maturity at the request of the holder (subject only to such interest penalties or other conditions as may be required by law), or negotiable securities which are publicly traded on a securities exchange, all such securities to be made payable to the escrow account: Provided, That such other securities shall be substituted in an amount no greater than 80 percent of the total market value of the escrow account at the time of such substitution: And provided, further, That should the market value of such other securities subsequently decrease, from time to time, then additional cash or securities qualified for investment hereunder shall promptly be added to the escrow account, in an amount equal to the amount of such decreased value; or
              (3) The charter operator shall:

              (i) Furnish and file with the Department a surety bond in the amount of $100,000 for the protection of the charter participants: Provided, however, That the liability of the surety to any charter participant shall not exceed the charter operator's applicable tariff fare; and
              (ii) Enter into an agreement with a bank, the terms of which shall include the following:
              (a) Whenever the gross amount of customers' deposits exceeds 25 percent of the charter operator's net worth, as computed under generally accepted accounting principles, the charter operator shall, on or before the 30th day of the succeeding month, place in escrow or in trust with the bank cash in an amount at least equal to the amount by which such deposits exceed 25 percent of its net worth: Provided, That negotiable securities may be substituted for cash, but the market value thereof shall at all times be not less than the amount of cash for which they are substituted;
              (b) The escrow agreement or the trust agreement between the bank and the operator shall not be effective until approved by the Department. Claims against the escrow or trust may be made only with respect to the nonperformance of air transportation.
              (b) As used in this section, the term bank means a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

              (c) Any bond furnished under this section shall insure the financial responsibility of the charter operator and the supplying of the air transportation in accordance with the contract between the charter operator and the charter participants, and shall be in the form set forth as appendix A to this part. Such bond shall be issued by a bonding or surety company (1) whose surety bonds are accepted by the Interstate Commerce Commission under 49 CFR 1084.6; or (2) which is listed in Best's Insurance Reports (fire and casualty) with a general policyholders' rating of “A” or better. The bonding or surety company shall be one legally authorized to issue bonds of that type in the State in which the charter originates or in which the charter operator is incorporated. For purposes of this section, the term “State” includes any territory or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia. The bond shall be specifically identified by the issuing surety with a company bond numbering system so that the Department may identify the bond with the specific charter or charters to which it relates: Provided, however, That these data may be set forth in an addendum attached to the bond which addendum must be signed by the charter operator and the surety company. It shall be effective on or before the date the operating authorization becomes effective. If the bond does not comply with the requirements of this section, or for any reason fails to provide satisfactory or adequate protection for the public, the Department will notify the direct air carrier and the charter operator, by registered or certified mail, stating the deficiencies of the bond. Unless such deficiencies are corrected within the time set forth in such notification, the subject charters shall in no event be operated.
              (d) Any bond furnished under this section shall provide that unless the charter participant files a claim with the charter operator, or, if he is unavailable, with the surety, within sixty (60) days after termination of the charter, the surety shall be released from all liability under the bond to such charter participant. The contract between the charter operator and the charter participants shall contain notice of this provision.

              Appendix A to Part 372—Overseas Military Personnel Charter Operator's Surety Bond Under Part 372 of the Special Regulations of the Department of Transportation (14 CFR Part 372)
              Know all men by these presents, that we ________ (name of charter operator) of ________ (address) as Principal hereinafter called “Principal”), and ________ (name of surety) a corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of ________ (State) as Surety (hereinafter called “Surety”) are held and firmly bound unto the United States of America in the sum of ________ (see § 372.24(a), 14 CFR Part 372) for which payment, well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally firmly by these presents.

              Whereas Principal is an overseas military personnel charter operator pursuant to the provisions of Part 372 of the Department's Special Regulations and other rules and regulations of the Department relating to security for the protection of charter participants, and has elected to file with the Department of Transportation such a bond as will insure financial responsibility with respect to all monies received from charter participants for services in connection with overseas military personnel charters to be operated subject to Part 372 of the Department's Special Regulations in accordance with contracts, agreements, or arrangements therefor, and
              Whereas this bond is written to assure compliance by Principal as an authorized charter operator with Part 372 of the Department's Special Regulations, and other rules and regulations of the Department relating to security for the protection of charter participants, and shall inure to the benefit of any and all charter participants to whom Principal may be held legally liable for any damages herein described.
              Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to charter participants any sum or sums for which Principal may be held legally liable by reason of Principal's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill and carry out all contracts, agreements, and arrangements made by Principal while this bond is in effect with respect to the receipt of moneys from charter participants, and proper disbursement thereof pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Part 372 of the Department's Special Regulations, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.
              The liability of Surety with respect to any charter participant shall not exceed the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant.
              The liability of Surety shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder, unless and until such payment or payments shall amount in the aggregate to the penalty (face amount) of the bond, but in no event shall Surety's obligation hereunder exceed the amount of said penalty.
              Surety agrees to furnish written notice to the Office of Aviation Analysis, Department of Transportation, forthwith of all suits or claims made and judgments rendered, and payments made by Surety under this bond.
              This bond shall cover the following Charters: 1

Principal or Surety may at any time terminate this bond by written notice to: Special Authorities Division (X-57), Office of Aviation Analysis, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590, such termination to become effective thirty (30) days after the actual receipt of said notice by the Department. Surety shall not be liable hereunder for the payment of any damages hereinbefore described which arise as a result of any contracts, agreements, undertakings, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made by Principal after the termination of this bond as herein provided, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the bond hereunder for the payment of any damages arising as a result of contracts, agreements, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made by Principal prior to the date that such termination becomes effective. Liability of Surety under this bond shall in all events be limited only to a charter participant or charter participants who shall within sixty (60) days after the termination of the particular charter described herein give written notice of claim to the charter operator or, if it is unavailable, to Surety, and all liability on this bond shall automatically terminate sixty (60) days after the termination date of each particular charter covered by this bond except for claims made in the time provided herein.

            (2) Such statements shall be mailed no later than the second business day following the last day of the billing period, covered by the statement.

            Air carriers are exempt from the following provisions of Title IV of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended: (a) Section 403, (b) section 404(b), and any and all other provisions of Title IV of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, to the extent necessary to enable air carriers to comply with the provisions of this part.
          
          
            § 374a.6
            Reporting requirements.

            (a) Air carriers shall make monthly reports to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics with respect to the credit for transportation furnished to candidates, or persons acting on behalf of candidates, during the period from 6 months before nomination, if any, or from 6 months before election, until the date of election. After that 6-month period, air carriers shall file such a report with the Bureau of Transportation Statistics not later than the 20th day following the end of the calendar month in which the election or nomination takes place, and thereafter when any change occurs in that report, until a negative report is filed showing that no debt for such extension of credit is owed to the carrier.
            (b)(1) A separate report shall be filed for each candidate with an aggregate indebtedness balance of over $5,000 on the last day of the month to which the report pertains. The report shall cover all debts incurred by the candidate, whether or not incurred in connection with his campaign, and all debts incurred by persons acting on his behalf in connection with such campaign. The indebtedness accounts reported shall be those which the air carrier knows, or has reason to know, have been incurred by or on behalf of a candidate; and it shall be presumed that the transportation for which the indebtedness has been incurred is intended to be used in connection with the campaign of such candidate for nomination for election, or election, to Federal office.
            (2) The reports required by this paragraph (b) shall be filed with the Office of Airline Information not later than the 20th day following the end of the calendar month to which the report pertains.

            (c) A separate report shall be filed for each person acting on behalf of any candidate, if the aggregate indebtedness balance of such person to the reporting air carrier (including all debts incurred by such person, whether or not incurred in connection with the campaign of a candidate, as defined in this part) is over $5,000 on the last day of the month to which the report pertains. The report shall be filed with the Office of Airline Information not later than the 20th day following the end of the calendar month to which the report pertains and shall include (1) the credit limitation established for such person; (2) the balance, if any, of the amount payable for transportation not paid for in advance; (3) any unpaid balance of the charges for such transportation as of the last day of the month covered by the report, and the length of time that such balance has remained unpaid; and (4) a description of the type and value of any bond, collateral, or other security securing such unpaid balance.

            (a) Every air carrier subject to the part shall retain for 2 years after a Federal election true copies of the following documents at its principal or general office in the United States:
            (1) All documents which evidence or reflect the furnishing of transportation to a candidate for political office or a person acting on his behalf;
            (2) All statements, invoices, bills, and receipts with respect to the furnishing of such transportation referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
            (b) Every air carrier shall make the documents listed in this section available in the United States upon request by an authorized representative of the DOT and shall permit such representative to make such notes and copies thereof as he deems appropriate.

            § 374a.8
            Prospective application of part.

            The provisions of this part shall apply only to the extension of credit by an air carrier to a candidate, or to a person acting on his behalf, which is made subsequent to the effective date of this part, and shall not be applicable to debts incurred prior to such date but which are unpaid as of the effective date of this part. The provisions of this part will be applicable, however, to all credit transactions which occur subsequent to the effective date of the part even though the credit account in which the transaction takes place was opened prior to the effective date of the part.

              As used in this part:
              
                Act means the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended;
              
                Air transportation means the carriage by aircraft of persons or property as a common carrier for compensation or hire or the carriage of mail by aircraft in interstate, overseas, or foreign commerce (see section 101 (10) and (23) of the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. 1301);

              § 375.10
              Certain foreign civil aircraft registered in ICAO member states.
              Subject to the observance of the applicable rules, conditions, and limitations set forth in this part:
              (a) Foreign civil aircraft manufactured in a State that at the time of manufacture was a member of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and registered in a State that at the time of flight is a member of ICAO, may be navigated in the United States;
              (b) Foreign civil aircraft manufactured in a State that at the time of manufacture was not a member of ICAO, and registered in a State that at the time of flight is a member of ICAO, may be navigated in the United States,
              (1) If the State of registry has notified ICAO that the requirements under which it issues or renders valid certificates of airworthiness are equal to or above the minimum standards established pursuant to the Chicago Convention, or
              (2) If such notification has not been made to ICAO at the time of flight, there is on file with the Department a statement by the State of registry that, with regard to aircraft of the type that is proposed to be operated hereunder, the requirements under which certificates of airworthiness are issued or rendered valid are equal to or above the minimum standards established pursuant to the Chicago Convention.
            
            
              § 375.11
              Other foreign civil aircraft.
              A foreign civil aircraft, including unmanned aircraft as defined in § 1.1 of this title, other than those referred to in § 375.10 may be navigated in the United States only when:
              (a) The operation is authorized by the Department under the provisions of this part, and
              (b) The aircraft complies with any applicable airworthiness standards of the Federal Aviation Administration for its operation.

              § 375.19
              Nature of privilege conferred.
              The provisions of this part, and of any permit issued hereunder, together with section 1108(b) of the Act, are designed, among other purposes, to carry out the international undertakings of the United States in the Chicago Convention, in particular Article 5. That article gives foreign aircraft the privilege of “taking on or discharging passengers, cargo or mail” subject to the right of the State where such embarkation or discharge takes place to impose such regulations, conditions or limitations as it may consider desirable. The U.S. Congress by the 1953 amendment to section 6 of the Air Commerce Act of 1926, now designated as section 1108(b) of the Act, authorizes the Department to permit such operations only where conditions of reciprocity and the interest of the public in the United States are met. Thus, the operator of any foreign registered aircraft is not entitled as a matter of right to the issuance, renewal or freedom from modification or change in a permit issuable pursuant to this authority. Accordingly, any authority conferred by this part may be withheld, revoked, amended, modified, restricted, suspended, withdrawn, or canceled by the Department in the interest of the public of the United States, without notice or hearing.
            
            
              § 375.20
              Airworthiness and registration certificates.
              Foreign civil aircraft shall carry currently effective certificates of registration and airworthiness issued or rendered valid by the country of registry and shall display the nationality and registration markings of that country. However, a foreign civil aircraft may carry, in lieu of such certificate of airworthiness, an effective special flight authorization issued by the Federal Aviation Administration for the operations being performed.
            
            
              § 375.21
              Airmen.
              Members of the flight crew of a foreign civil aircraft shall have in their personal possession valid airman certificates or licenses authorizing them to perform their assigned functions in the aircraft and for the operation involved issued or rendered valid by the country of registry of the aircraft or by the United States. No such flight crew members shall perform any flight duty within the United States that they are not currently authorized to perform in the country issuing or validating the certificate.
            
            
              § 375.22
              Flight operations.
              Flights of foreign civil aircraft in the United States shall be conducted in accordance with the currently applicable rules of the Federal Aviation Administration.
            
            
              § 375.23
              Maximum allowable weights.
              Foreign civil aircraft that are permitted to navigate in the United States on the basis of foreign airworthiness certificates must conform to the limitations on maximum certificated weights prescribed or authorized for the particular variation of the aircraft type, and for the particular category of use, by the country of manufacture of the aircraft type involved.
            
            
              § 375.24
              Entry and clearance.
              All U.S. entry and clearance requirements for aircraft, passengers, crews, baggage and cargo shall be followed.
            
            
              § 375.25
              Unauthorized operations.
              No foreign civil aircraft shall be navigated in the United States unless authorized by this part. Commercial air operations (other than those authorized by § 375.36) shall not be undertaken without a permit issued by the Department.
            
            
              § 375.26
              Waiver of sovereign immunity.
              Owners and operators of aircraft operated under this part that are engaged in proprietary of commercial activities waive any defense of sovereign immunity from suit in any action or proceeding instituted against any of them in any court or other tribunal in the United States for any claim relating to that operation.

              Operations other than commercial air operations.
              Foreign civil aircraft that are not engaged in commercial air operations into, out of, or within the United States may be operated in the United States and may carry non-revenue traffic to, from or between points in the United States.
            
            
              § 375.31
              Demonstration flights of foreign aircraft.
              Flights of foreign civil aircraft within the United States may be made for the purpose of demonstration of the aircraft or any component thereof (including demonstrations at airshows), provided no persons, cargo or mail are carried for remuneration or hire.
            
            
              § 375.32
              Flights incidental to agricultural and industrial operations outside the United States.
              Foreign civil aircraft that are engaged in agricultural or industrial operations to be performed wholly outside the United States may be navigated into, out of, and within the United States in connection with those operations provided that the aircraft is not at the time engaged in the carriage of passengers, cargo, or mail for remuneration or hire.
            
            
              § 375.33
              Transit flights, irregular operations.
              Foreign civil aircraft carrying passengers, property or mail for remuneration or hire, but not engaged in scheduled international air services, are authorized to navigate nonstop across the territory of the United States and to make stops for non-traffic purposes. The navigation of foreign civil aircraft in the United States is not authorized under this section when the elapsed time between landing and takeoff at a stop in the United States exceeds 24 hours and passengers are permitted to leave the airport or when passengers, property or mail are transferred to another aircraft. Flights involving stops under such circumstances may, however, be performed in the case of emergency relating to the safey of the aircraft, passengers, cargo or crew.

              Foreign civil aircraft may be operated in the United States for the purpose of giving indoctrination training in the operation of the aircraft concerned to a buyer or a buyer's employees or designees. This section does not, however, authorize foreign civil aircraft to be used within the United States for the purpose of flight instruction for remuneration or hire.
            
            
              § 375.35
              Free transportation.
              (a) Foreign civil aircraft may be navigated in the United States by a foreign air carrier for the transportation of persons and property specified in paragraph (b) of this section over the following non-traffic segments provided such transportation is not for compensation or hire:
              (1) Between two or more points in the United States;
              (2) Between a point in the United States named in the carrier's section 402 permit or exemption, and a point outside the United States not so named, when authorized in accordance with the provisions of part 216 of this chapter to carry blind sector traffic to or from such unnamed foreign point; and
              (3) Between a point in the United States and a point outside thereof when the carrier lands at the United States point for non-traffic purposes in exercise of the privilege granted under the International Air Services Transit Agreement.
              (b) Free transportation may be provided under this section for the following categories of persons and property:
              (1) Directors, officers and employees, and their parents and immediate families, of the foreign air carrier operating the aircraft;
              (2) Directors, officers and employees, and their parents and immediate families, of an air carrier or another foreign air carrier traveling pursuant to a pass interchange arrangement;

              (3) Travel agents being transported for the purpose of familiarizing themselves with the carrier's services, if the agents are under no obligation to sell the transporting carrier's services;
              
              (4) Witnesses and attorneys attending any legal investigation in which any such foreign air carrier is involved;
              (5) Persons injured in aircraft accidents and physicians and nurses attending such persons;

              (7) Any person who has the duty of guarding foreign government officials travelling on official business; and
              (8) Guests of a foreign air carrier (including members of the press) on delivery flights of newly-acquired or newly-renovated aircraft.
              (c) A charge reasonably related to the value of meals and beverages furnished enroute shall not be deemed to constitute compensation or hire for purposes of this section.
            
            
              § 375.36
              Lease of foreign civil aircraft without crew.
              Foreign civil aircraft that are leased without crew to an air carrier or citizen or permanent resident of the United States, and used by the lessee in otherwise authorized air transportation or commercial air operations, may be operated into, out of, and within the United States in accordance with any applicable regulations prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration.
            
            
              § 375.37
              Certain business aviation activities using U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft.
              For purposes of this section, “company” is defined as a person that operates civil aircraft in furtherance of a business other than air transportation. U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft that are not otherwise engaged in commercial air operations, or foreign air transportation, and which are operated by a company in the furtherance of a business other than transportation by air, when the carriage is within the scope of, and incidental to, the business of the company (other than transportation by air), may be operated to, from, and within the United States as follows:
              (a) Intra-company operations. A company operating a U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft may conduct operations for a subsidiary or parent or a subsidiary of its parent on a fully-allocated cost reimbursable basis; provided, that the operator of the U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft must hold majority ownership in, be majority owned by, or have a common parent with, the company for which it provides operations;
              (b) Interchange operations. A company may lease a U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft to another company in exchange for equal time when needed on the other company's U.S. registered aircraft, where no charge, assessment, or fee is made, except that a charge may be made not to exceed the difference between the cost of owning, operating, and maintaining the two aircraft;
              (c) Joint ownership operations. A company that jointly owns a U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft and furnishes the flight crew for that aircraft may collect from the other joint owners of that aircraft a share of the actual costs involved in the operation of the aircraft; and
              (d) Time-sharing operations. A company may lease a U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft, with crew, to another company; provided, that the operator may collect no charge for the operation of the aircraft except reimbursement for:
              
              (1) Fuel, oil, lubricants, and other additives.
              (2) Travel expenses of the crew, including food, lodging, and ground transportation.
              (3) Hanger and tie-down costs away from the aircraft's base of operations.
              (4) Insurance obtained for the specific flight.
              (5) Landing fees, airport taxes, and similar assessments.
              (6) Customs, foreign permit, and similar fees directly related to the flight.
              (7) In flight food and beverages.
              (8) Passenger ground transportation.
              (9) Flight planning and weather contract services.
              (10) An additional charge equal to 100 percent of the expenses for fuel, oil, lubricants, and other additives.

              § 375.38
              Other foreign civil aircraft: Small unmanned aircraft operated exclusively as model aircraft.
              Foreign civil aircraft that are small unmanned aircraft used exclusively as model aircraft may be operated in the United States only when the individual:
              (a) Completes the registration process in accordance with §§ 48.30, 48.100(b) and (c), 48.105, and 48.115 of this title;
              (b) Identifies the aircraft in accordance with the aircraft marking requirements in §§ 48.200 and 48.205 of this title; and
              (c) Complies with the requirements of Sec. 336 of Pub. L. 112-95 (Feb. 14, 2012).

            Subpart E—Operations Requiring Specific Preflight Authorization of Filing
            
              § 375.40
              Permits for commercial air operations.
              (a) Permit required. Except for aircraft being operated under a foreign air carrier permit, an exemption, or as otherwise provided in subpart D or H of this part, foreign civil aircraft may engage in commercial air operations only if there is carried on board the aircraft a permit issued by the Department in accordance with this subpart authorizing the operations involved.
              (b) Aircraft are not authorized to engage in air transportation under this section. Where an operation involves the carriage of persons, property or mail for compensation or hire, the Department will determine whether particular flights for which a permit is sought will be in common carriage, and therefore in air transportation, based on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the applicant's entire operations. The burden rests upon the applicant in each instance to demonstrate by an appropriate factual showing that the contemplated operation will not constitute common carriage from, to or within the United States. In general, an applicant that holds itself out to the public, or to a particular class or segment, as willing to furnish transportation for hire is a common carrier.
            
            
              § 375.41
              Agricultural and industrial operations within the United States.
              Foreign civil aircraft shall not be used for such commercial air operations as crop dusting, pest control, pipeline patrol, mapping, surveying, banner towing, skywriting or similar agricultural or industrial operations within the United States, including its territorial waters and overlying airspace, unless a permit has been issued by the Department and the operation is conducted in accordance with all applicable State and local laws and regulations as well as the applicable provisions of this part.
            
            
              § 375.42
              Transport operations—occasional planeload charters.
              Occasional planeload charters may be authorized where, because of their limited nature and extent, special equipment or facilities utilized, or other circumstances pertaining to them, it appears that they are not within the scope of the applicant's normal holding out of transportation services to the general public. Such charters are normally limited to those in which the entire capacity of the aircraft is engaged by a single charterer, and since they are occasional in nature, should not exceed for any one applicant more than six flights during a calendar year. This part does not authorize operations that involve solicitation of the general public such as is usually involved in the transportation of individually-ticketed passengers or individually-waybilled cargo, or in which the charterer is a travel agent, a charter operator, a broker, an air freight forwarder or any other organization that holds itself out to the general public to provide transportation services. Carriage of cargo for the operator's own account is governed by the provisions of this section if the cargo is to be resold or otherwise used in the furtherance of a business other than the business of providing carriage by aircraft.
            
            
              § 375.43
              Application for foreign aircraft permit.

              (a) Applications for foreign aircraft permits shall be submitted on OST Form 4509, (Appendix A), in duplicate, addressed to the Chief, Discrete Operations Branch, Licensing Division, P-45, Office of Aviation Operations. Upon a showing of good cause, applications may be made by telegram or by telephone.
              (b) Applications shall contain a proper identification (including citizenship) of the applicant (the operator of the aircraft concerned) and of the owner thereof (if different from the applicant), a description of the aircraft by make, model, and registration marks; and a full description of the operations for which authority is desired, indicating type and dates of operations and number of flights, and routing. In the case of cargo flights, the names of all contractors, agents, if any, and the beneficial owner of the cargo, and a description of the cargo and of the proposed operations shall be provided. In the case of passenger flights, a full identification and description of the group chartering the aircraft, and identification of the travel agent, if any, shall be provided. Applications shall also contain a statement as to whether the applicant's homeland allows operators of U.S.-registered aircraft to conduct similar operations.
              (c) Applications shall be filed at least 15 days in advance of the proposed commencement date of the operations. The Department may direct the applicant to serve copies of its application on additional persons. Late applications may be considered by the Department upon a showing of good cause.
              (d)(1) Any party in interest may file a memorandum supporting or opposing an application. Two copies of each memorandum shall be filed within 7 business days after the application is filed but no later than the proposed commencement date of the operations. Memoranda will be considered to the extent practicable; the Department may act on an application without waiting for supporting or opposing memoranda to be filed.
              (2) Each memorandum shall set forth the reasons why the applications should be granted or denied, accompanied by whatever data, including affidavits, the Department is asked to consider.
              (3) A copy of each memorandum shall be served on the applicant.
              (e)(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the Department, each application and memorandum filed in response shall be available for public inspection at the Licensing Division of the Office of Aviation Operations immediately upon filing. Notice of the filing of all applications shall be published in the Department's Weekly List of Applications Filed.
              (2) Any person objecting to public disclosure of any information in an application or memorandum must state the grounds for the objection in writing. If the Department finds that disclosure of all or part of the information should be withheld under applicable provisions of law, and the public interest does not require disclosure, it will order that the injurious information be withheld.
              (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2106-0002)
            
            
              § 375.44
              Issuance of permit.
              (a) The Department will issue a foreign aircraft permit if it finds that the proposed operations meet the requirements of this part and are in the public interest. Foreign aircraft permits may be conditioned or limited by the Department. Permits must be carried aboard the applicant's aircraft during flight over U.S. territory, and are not transferable.
              (b) In determining whether to grant a particular application, the Department will consider, among other factors, the extent to which the country of the applicant's nationality deals with U.S. civil aircraft operators on the basis of substantial reciprocity, and whether the operation is otherwise in the public interest.
            
            
              § 375.45
              Records and reports of occasional planeload charters.
              (a) Cargo documents. The holder of a permit for cargo operations shall issue a manifest or shipping document to its shipper with respect to each shipment.
              (b) [Reserved]
              (c) Contents of documents for passenger flights. The holder of a permit for passenger charters originating or terminating in the United States shall require each charterer to file with it prior to flight a list of names and addresses of all passengers to be transported on each flight.
              (d) Reports of unused authority. All foreign operators of occasional planeload charters for which authority is granted must notify the Department, in writing, not later than 15 days after the expiration of their permits, or their failure to use this authority. The unused authority shall otherwise be deemed to have been exercised.
            
          
          
            Subpart F—Transit Flights
            
              § 375.50
              Transit flights; scheduled international air service operations.
              (a) Requirement of notice. Scheduled international air services proposed to be operated pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement in transit across the United States may not be undertaken by foreign civil aircraft unless the operator of such aircraft, and (if other than the operator) the carrier offering such service to the public, has, not less than 30 days prior to the date of commencement of such service, filed a Notice of Proposed Transit Flights Pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
              (b) Filing of the notice. An original and two copies of the Notice shall be filed with the Chief, Discrete Operations Branch, Licensing Division, P-45, Office of Aviation Operations. Copies of the Notice shall be served upon the Department of State and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. The filing date shall be the date of actual receipt by the Department.
              (c) Content of notice. A “Notice of Proposed Transit Flights Pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement” shall be clearly labeled as such, and as a minimum shall set forth, with whatever detail may be necessary, the following information:
              (1) The name, country or organization, and citizenship of the operator, and, if other than the operator, of the carrier offering the services to the public. If any interest (direct or indirect) in the operator or offeror of services is held by nationals of a country other than the country of organization or citizenship, the nature and extent of such interest must be fully disclosed. If any officer or director of the operator or carrier offering the services is a national of a country other than the country of organization or citizenship, the position of duties of such officer or director, and the officer and director's relevant position in relation to other officers and directors must similarly be fully disclosed. If the information required in this subsection has been previously supplied to the Department, the applicant may incorporate it by reference.
              (2) The State of registration of the aircraft proposed to be operated.
              (3) A full description of the proposed operations including the type of operations (passenger, property, mail, or combination), date of commencement, duration and frequency of flights, and routing (including each terminal and intermediate point to be served).
              (4) A statement as to whether or not any advertisement or publication of the proposed operations has been made in the United States. If there has been any advertisement or publication of the operations in the United States, copies of all such advertisements or publications shall be included.
              (5) Any change with respect to these matters (minor changes in schedules or routing excepted) shall also be filed with the Department.
              (d) Authorized operations. If the operator and the carrier offering services to the public (if different from the operator) have filed a “Notice of Proposed Transit Flights Pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement,” at least 30 days before the date of commencement of the proposed operations in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the described operations may be commenced and performed without further authorization from the Department, unless and until the Department issues an order notifying the operator and/or the carrier offering the services to the public that, considering the matters submitted in the Notice, the Department is of the view that a question may exist as to whether:
              
              (1) The proposed services are authorized pursuant to the terms of the International Air Services Transit Agreement;
              (2) Substantial ownership and effective control are vested in nationals of a State party to the International Air Services Transit Agreement;
              (3) The proposed operations will be in compliance with the laws of the United States, the Department's rules, or the provisions of this section; or
              (4) The operator or its government have performed their obligations under the International Air Services Transit Agreement.
              (e) Prohibited operations. If the Department issues an order of notification as described in paragraph (d) of this section, neither the operator, nor the carrier offering the services to the public, shall commence the proposed operations, or, except as may be otherwise specified in the order, operate any flights subsequent to receipt of the order, unless and until the Department issues a foreign aircraft permit pursuant to the provisions of section 1108(b) of the Act and this part specifically authorizing such operations.
              (f) Foreign aircraft permit—application and procedures. If the Department issues an Order of Notification as described in paragraph (d) of this section, the carrier's Notice of Proposed Transit Flights Pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement shall be treated as an application for the required foreign aircraft permit, and further procedures on such application shall be as directed by the Department.
              (g) Short notice filing. Nothing in this section shall be construed as precluding the filing of an application for a foreign aircraft permit to perform transit operations pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement less than 30 days in advance of the proposed operation. No such flights shall be operated, however, unless or until a specific foreign aircraft permit has been issued by the Department.
              (h) Nature of privilege conferred. Air transportation is not authorized under this section, and the burden rests upon each operator and carrier to show that the proposed operations will not constitute air transportation within the meaning of the Federal Aviation Act. In addition, each operator and carrier has the burden of demonstrating that the proposed operations are authorized by the International Air Services Transit Agreement, and that the appropriate authorization should not be withheld pursuant to section 5 of Article I thereof. Stopovers for the convenience or pleasure of the passengers are not authorized under this section and stops other than for strictly operational reasons shall not be made. The consolidation on the same aircraft of an operation under this section with a service authorized under section 402 or 416(b) of the Act is not authorized by this section. Any authorization or permit granted under this section is nontransferable, and may be withheld, revoked, suspended, withdrawn, or cancelled by the Department, without notice or hearing, if required by the public interest. Operators of aircraft registered in countries not parties to the International Air Services Transit Agreement shall make special application to the Department under § 375.70.
            
          
          
            Subpart G—Penalties
            
              § 375.60
              Penalties.

              The operation of a foreign aircraft within the United States or over adjacent territorial waters in violation of the provisions of this part constitutes a violation of the Federal Aviation Act and of this chapter, and may, in addition, constitute a violation of the rules of the Federal Aviation Administration. Such operation makes the person or persons responsible for the violation or violations subject to a civil penalty as provided in section 901 of the Act, and to the alteration, amendment, modification, suspension or revocation of any permit issued under this part and of any U.S. certificate involved as provided in section 609 of the Act. Engaging in air transportation as defined in the Act by a foreign aircraft without a foreign air carrier permit issued pursuant to section 402 of the Act or an exemption, or in violation of the terms of such authority constitutes not only a violation of this part but of title IV of the Act as well, which entails a criminal penalty as set forth in section 902 of the Act.
            
          
          
            Subpart H—Special Authorization
            
              § 375.70
              Special authorization.
              Any person desiring to navigate a foreign civil aircraft within the United States other than as specifically provided in this part may petition the Department for a special authorization to conduct the particular flight or series of flights. Such authorization may be issued only if the Department finds that the proposed operation is fully consistent with the applicable law, that the applicant's homeland grants a similar privilege with respect to operators of U.S.-registered aircraft, and that the proposed operation is in the interest of the public of the United States.

                The last sentence of 5 U.S.C. 558(c) provides: “When the licensee has made timely and sufficient application for a renewal or a new license in accordance with agency rules, a license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature does not expire until the application has been finally determined by the agency.”
              
              
              (b) Nothing in this part prevents the Board from terminating at any time, in accordance with law, any authorization or any extension of an authorization.
              (c) Nothing in this part constitutes a determination that any given authorization is a “license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c).

              § 377.3
              Authorizations not covered by 5 U.S.C. 558(c).
              The Board hereby determines that the following authorizations are not licenses “with reference to an activity of a continuing nature” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c):
              (a) Authorizations granted for a specified period of 180 days or less; and
              (b) Authorizations, other than those granted under section 401 of the Act, that by their terms are subject to termination at an uncertain date upon the happening of an event, including fulfillment of a condition subsequent or occurrence of a contingency.

              Certain authorizations with alternative termination dates.
              Unless granted under section 401 of the Act, an authorization that by its terms is subject to termination alternatively, either at an uncertain date upon the happening of an event or upon the arrival of a specified date:
              (a) Will not be considered a “license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c), if the event occurs before the specified date; and

              (b) Ordinarily (subject to Board interpretation under § 377.5) will be considered such a license, if the event does not occur before the specified date and that date is more than 180 days after the effective date of the authorization.

              Procedure to obtain Board interpretation.
              (a) The Board will determine upon written request by the holder of a temporary authorization or by any competitively affected air carrier or foreign air carrier, or upon its own initiative, whether the temporary authorization is a “license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c).
              (b) A written request for such a Board determination shall be filed at least 60 days before the deadline set forth in § 377.10 for a timely renewal application.
              (c) The filing of such a written request shall not affect the timeliness requirements for renewal applications that are set forth in § 377.10 or any other applicable Board rule or order.

            Subpart B—Renewal Applications and Procedure Thereon
            
              § 377.10
              Requirements for, and effect of, renewal applications.
              (a) Identification of authorization covered by renewal application. Each renewal application shall identify the authorization or authorizations to which it is intended to relate. The application shall indicate the applicant's intention to rely upon 5 U.S.C. 558(c) as implemented by this part. In case of applications for renewal of an authorization for route service, the renewal application shall specifically identify the separate routes which the applicant proposes to continue serving pursuant to the expiring authorization, pending final determination of the renewal application.
              (b) Contents of renewal application. The application must contain all the information required by law and the Board's regulations, and meet the requirements thereof as to form. The new authorization sought need not be of the same duration as the expiring authorization. If the application relates to renewal of route authority, it must contain, as a minimum, a request for renewed authority to render route service between the terminals named in each separate route for which renewal is requested.
              (c) Timeliness. The application must be filed and served in compliance with applicable law and the Board's regulations at least 60 days before the expiration date of the outstanding temporary authorization, except that:
              (1) For certificates issued under section 401 of the Act with a specified expiration date, the deadline is 180 days before the expiration date;
              (2) For certificates issued under section 401 of the Act that terminate by their terms upon the happening of an event that could not be foreseen, the deadline is 30 days after the time that the carrier has notice that the event will occur or has occurred;
              (3) For foreign air carrier permits issued under section 402 of the Act and exemptions issued under section 416 to non-U.S. citizens, the deadline is the expiration date itself;
              (4) For renewal by substantially equivalent certificate authority of fixed term route authorizations granted by exemption and for interim extension of the exemption, pursuant to § 399.18 of this chapter, the deadline is 90 days before the expiration date; and
              (5) Nothing in this part supersedes a requirement for earlier filing contained in any law, Board rule or order, or temporary authorization.
              (d) Effect. In the case of authorizations which constitute licenses with reference to activities of a continuing nature within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c), the filing of an application complying in all respects with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section shall extend the authorization to which it relates as then outstanding in its entirety, together with all applicable terms, conditions and limitations, until the application has been finally determined by the Board. In the case of routes granted under section 401 of the Act, the duty to render adequate service continues to attach to every point as provided in the expired authorization which is extended pursuant to this provision. The date of final determination of the application shall be the date when the final order determining the application takes effect, or when the applicable period for filing of petitions for rehearing, reargument or reconsideration expires, or when a timely filed petition therefor is denied, whichever occurs latest.

              When the Board determines that a renewal application does not comply with the requirements of this part, or that it does not relate to a license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature, it will so notify the applicant. The applicant may amend his application to cure the deficiency as a matter of right at any time prior to the date when the application was due pursuant to § 377.10(c).

              § 380.1
              Applicability.

              This part applies to Public Charter air transportation of passengers in interstate or foreign air transportation, whether furnished by direct air carriers or Public Charter operators. This part also relieves such charter operators from various provisions of subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (statute), formerly Title IV of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, for the purpose of enabling them to provide Public Charters utilizing aircraft chartered from such direct air carriers. It also declines jurisdiction over foreign Public Charter operators operating foreign-originating Public Charters.
            
            
              § 380.2
              Definitions.

                Educational institution means a school that is operated as such on a year-round basis and is empowered to grant academic degrees or secondary school diplomas by any government in the United States or by a foreign government.
              
                Foreign air carrier means a direct air carrier that holds a foreign air carrier permit issued under the statute or an exemption issued under the statute authorizing direct foreign air transportation.
              
                Foreign Public Charter opertor means an indirect air carrier which is not a citizen of the United States as defined in the statute, that is authorized to engage in the formation of groups for transportation on Public Charters in accordance with this part.
              
                Indirect air carrier means any person who undertakes to engage indirectly in air transportation operations and who uses for such transportation the services of a direct air carrier.

              (2) The spouse, children, and parents of a student participant may accompany the participant on a charter operated under this section.
              (e) The Department, upon application or on its own initiative, may waive any of the provision of this part if it finds such action to be in the public interest.

              (c) If the charter is on a round-trip basis, the departing flight and returning need not be performed by the same direct air carrier.
              (d) The air transportation portion of the charter must be performed by direct air carriers that hold authority under Chapter 411 and 413 of the Statute, or are operating under 14 CFR part 298, except that only U.S. citizen direct air carriers may provide air transportation for operations in interstate air transportation.

              (b) If the charter operator cancels 10 or more days before the scheduled date of departure, the operator must so notify each participant in writing within 7 days after the cancellation but in any event not less than 10 days before the scheduled departure date of the outbound trip. If a charter is canceled less than 10 days before scheduled departure (i.e., for circumstances that make it physically impossible to perform the charter trip), the operator must get the message to each participant as soon as possible.
            
            
              § 380.13

              § 380.14
              Unused space.

              Noting contained in this part shall preclude a charter operator from utilizing any unused space on an aircraft by it for a Public Charter for the transportation, on a free or reduced basis, of such charter operator's employees, directors, and officers, and parents and immediate families of such persons.
            
            
              § 380.15
              Substitution for charter participants.

              Charter contract.
              The charter contract between the charter operator or foreign charter operator and the direct air carrier shall evidence a binding commitment on the part of the carrier to furnish the air transportation required for the trip or trips covered by the contract.

              (c) Except as set forth in § 380.33a for operator's option plan contracts, if the charter prospectus names alternative dates or cities, any solicitation material that states a price per passenger shall also state that the actual dates or cities have not yet been selected, if that is the case.
              (d) Any solicitation material that names a hotel but does not name every hotel named in the operator-participant contract shall also state that substitutions may be made.

              (e) In any solicitation material from a direct air carrier, indirect air carrier, or an agent of either, for a charter, charter tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground accommodations), or a charter tour component (e.g., a hotel stay), any price stated for such charter, tour, or component shall be the entire price to be paid by the participants to the air carrier, or agent, for such charter, tour, or component.
            
            
              § 380.31
              General requirements for operator-participant contracts.
              (a) Except for telephone sales for which payment is made by credit card as described in paragraph (b) of this section, the charter operator shall not accept payment from or on behalf of a prospective participant unless the participant has agreed to the conditions of the charter by signing an operator-participant contract as described in § 380.32. If a member of a group that will travel together pays for the group, that member may sign the contract on behalf of the group.
              (b) For telephone sales only, the charter operator may accept payment by credit card without the participant having first signed an operator-participant contract provided that the charter operator first advises the customer:
              (1) That he or she has the right to receive the operator-participant contract before making a booking;
              (2) That the operator-participant contract will be mailed to the participant within 24 hours of accepting payment by credit card; and
              (3) That the operator-participant contract must be signed, and the signed portion returned to the operator, before travel.
              (4) A full refund must be made of any amounts charged to a credit card for any participant who cancels before the operator-participant contract is signed.
              (c) The contract form may include a space that participants may check to authorize the charter operator to retain their money while attempting to make other arrangements for them if there is no space available on the flight or on specific alternative flights they have requested.

              (d) If there is no space available on the flight or specific alternative flights requested by the participant the operator shall return all the participant's money within 7 days after receiving it unless the participant, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, has authorized the operator to retain the payments while the operator attempts to make other arrangements for the participant. If the operator retains the payments while attempting to make other arrangements for the participant, it shall notify the participant of the fact within 7 days after receiving the payments, but in no event later than the departure. For the purpose of the time periods in this paragraph, receipt of money by a travel agent on behalf of a charter operator will not be considered as receipt by the operator.
              (e) Except as set forth in § 380.33a for operator's option plan contracts, the operator-participant contract shall not specify alternative dates for the outbound or return flights, or alternative origin or destination cities for any flight leg.
              (f) The contract form shall be printed in 7-point or larger type. The statements required by paragraph (a), (f), (h), (l), (r), (s), and (x) of § 380.32 shall be printed so as to contrast with the rest of the contract by the use of bold-faced type, capital letters, or a type size that is at least 50 percent larger than that used for the rest of the contract.
              (g) The contract form shall include a space that participants may check to indicate that they wish to be furnished details of trip cancellation, health, and accident insurance.
              (h) The contract form shall be designed so as to enable participants to retain a copy of the general terms and conditions after signing it. The specific information supplied by participants (such as choices of dates, cities, or other options) need not be retainable.

              Contracts between charter operators and charter participants shall state:
              (a) The name and complete mailing address of the charter operator;
              (b) The name of the direct air carrier, the dollar amounts of that carrier's liability limitations for participant's baggage, the type and capacity of the aircraft to be used for the flight, and the conditions governing aircraft-equipment substitutions;
              (c) The dates of the outbound and return flights;

                 or, when the charter is sold to the participant by a retail travel agent, checks and money orders may be made payable to the agent, who must in turn make his check payable to the escrow account at the depository bank;
              
                
                  1 If the credit card merchant account is separate from the depository account, it must be used solely as a conduit, i.e., all credit card payments toward Public Charter trips must be immediately remitted to the depository account in full, without holdback, or retention of any portion of the participant's payment. If the depository bank is not the credit card merchant bank, the Department must be satisfied that there are adequate procedural safeguards for the protection of participants' payments.
              
              (g) The tour itinerary, if any, including the name and location of the hotels, length of stay at each, and other ground accommodations and services that are part of the tour;
              (h) That the charter operator may not cancel the charter less than 10 days before the scheduled departure date, except for circumstances that make it physically impossible to perform the charter tip;
              (i) That if a charter is canceled 10 or more days before the scheduled departure date, the operator will notify the participant in writing within 7 days after the cancellation, but in any event at least 10 days before the scheduled departure;

              (j) That is a charter is canceled less than 10 days before departure (i.e., for circumstances that make it physically impossible to perform the charter trip), the operator will get the message to the participant as soon as possible;
              
              (k) That if the charter is canceled, a refund will be made to the participant within 14 days after the cancellation;
              (l) The right to refunds if the participant changes plans is limited;
              (m) The right to refunds if the participant changes plans, including
              (1) The right to a full refund, for sales made by credit card, until an operator-participant contract is signed; and
              (2) That any participant who wishes to cancel will receive a full refund (less any applicable administrative fee, not to exceed $25) upon providing a substitute participant to the charter operator or its sales agent, or upon being substituted for by a participant found by the charter operator;
              (n) The procedure for obtaining the refunds described in paragraph (m) of this section, including that they will be made within 14 days after the cancellation or substitution;
              (o) The meaning of “major change”, as set forth in § 380.33(a);
              (p) That if the charter operator knows of a major change 10 or more days before scheduled departure, the operator will notify the participant of the change within 7 days after first knowing of it, but in any event at least 10 days before scheduled departure;
              (q) That is the operator first knows of a major change less than 10 days before scheduled departure, the operator will get the message to the participant as soon as possible;
              (r) That within 7 days after receiving a pre-departure notification of a major change but in no event later than departure, the participant may cancel, and that a full refund will be made to the participant within 14 days after canceling;
              (s) That upon a post-departure notification of a major change, the participant may reject the substituted hotel or the changed date, origin, or destination of a flight leg and be sent, within 14 days after the return date named in the contract, a refund of the portion of his payment allocable to the hotel accommodations or air transportation not provided;
              (t) That the participants rights and remedies set forth in the contract, including the procedures for major changes, shall be in addition to any other rights or remedies available under applicable law, although the operator may condition a refund on the participant's waiver of additional remedies;
              (u) That trip cancellation, health, and accident insurance is available and that the operator will furnish details of the insurance to participants who check the space provided for this purpose on the contract form;
              (v) The name and address of the surety company or bank issuing the security agreement; and that unless the charter participant files a claim with the charter operator or, if he is unavailable, with the securer, within 60 days after termination of the charter, the securer shall be released from all liability under the security agreement to that participant. Termination means the date of arrival (or in the case of a canceled charter, the intended date or arrival) of the return flight. If there is no return flight in a participant's itinerary, termination means the date or intended date of departure of the last flight in the participant's itinerary;
              (w) For international flights only: That additional restrictions may be imposed on the flight by the foreign government involved, and that if landing rights are denied by a foreign government the flight will be canceled with a full refund to the participant. This statement need not be included in the contract if—
              (1) The prospectus includes a certification by the charter operator and the direct air carrier that landing rights have been obtained from all the foreign governments involved, and
              (2) All the foreign governments involved have adopted country-of-origin rules for charterworthiness;
              (x) That the charter operator is the principal and is responsible to the participants for all services and accommodations offered in connection with the charter. However, the contract may expressly provide that the charter operator, unless negligent, is not responsible for personal injury or property damage caused by any direct air carrier, hotel or other supplier of services in connection with the charter.
            
            
              
              § 380.33
              Major changes in itinerary or price; refunds.
              (a) For the purposes of this section, “major change” means any of the following:
              (1) A change in the departure or return date shown in the operator-participant contract, (or, if the contract states alternative dates, the date designated to the participant by the charter operator in accordance with § 380.33a(b)), unless the change results from a flight delay. In any event, however, a date change that the operator knows of more than 2 days before the scheduled flight date, and any delay of more than 48 hours, will be considered a major change.
              (2) A change in the origin or destination city shown in the operator-participant contract for any flight leg (or, if the contract states alternative cities, the city designated to the participant by the operator in accordance with § 380.33a(b)), unless the change affects only the order in which cities named in a tour package are visited.
              (3) A substitution of any hotel that is not named in the operator-participant contract; and
              (4) A price increase to the participant that occurs 10 or more days before departure and results in an aggregate price increase of more than 10 percent.
              (b) The charter operator shall not increase the price to any participant less than 10 days before departure.
              (c) The charter operator shall notify all participants of major changes, as required by the operator-participant contracts. This notification shall include the participants' rights to refunds required to be described in the operator-participant contract. The operator shall, if applicable, also notify the participants that the acceptance of a refund constitutes a waiver of their legal rights.
              (d) Except as otherwise specified, notifications and refunds required by this part are considered made at the time they are mailed or sent by an equivalent method.
              (e) The charter operator shall make all refunds required to be described in the operator-participant contract within the time limits set forth in paragraphs (k), (n), (r), and (s) of § 380.32, as applicable.

              (a) For the purposes of this part, an operator's option plan contract that states alternative dates for the outbound or return flights, or alternative origin or destination cities for any flight leg.
              (b) Operator's option plan contracts shall state, in addition to the information required by § 380.32, that the selection of the actual dates or cities, as applicable, is at the charter operator's option and will not entitle the participant to a refund, and that the operator will notify the participant of the actual dates or cities at least 10 days before the earliest of any alternative dates for the outbound flight.
              (c) Contract forms for all operator's option plan contracts shall be labeled “OPERATOR'S OPTION PLAN” in bold-faced capital letters at least 1/4 inch high. The statement required by paragraph (b) of this section and the statement of alternative dates (§ 380.32(c)) or alternative cities (§ 380.32(d)), as applicable, shall be printed so as to contrast with the rest of the contract, as set forth in § 380.31(f).
              (d) Any solicitation material that states a price per passenger for an operator's option plan contract shall clearly and conspicuously—
              (1) Identify that price as being for the operator's option plan,
              (2) Name all the possible dates or cities, as applicable, and
              (3) State that the selection of the actual dates or cities is at the charter operator's option.
              (e) Charter operators and their agents shall not misrepresent to prospective participants, orally, in solicitation materials, or otherwise, the probability that any particular city or date will be selected from among the alternatives named in an operator's option plan contract.
              (f) The charter operator shall notify all participants with operator's option plan contracts of the actual dates or cities, as applicable, as required by contracts.

              Security and depository agreements.

              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the charter operator or foreign charter operator shall furnish a security agreement in an amount for not less than the charter price for the air transportation, if only air transportation is involved, or, if the charter involves land accommodations in addition to air transportation, a security agreement in one of the following amounts dependent upon the length of the charter or series of charters:
              (1) For a charter or series of charters of 14 days or less, security in an amount of not less than the charter price for the air transportation to be furnished in connection with such charter or series of charters;
              (2) For a charter or series of charters of more than 14 days but less than 28 days security in an amount of not less than twice the charter price; and
              (3) For a charter or series of charters of 28 days or more, security in an amount of not less than three times the charter price: Provided, however, That the liability of the securer to any charter participant shall not exceed amounts paid by that participant to the charter operator with respect to the charter.
              (b) The direct air carrier and the charter operator or foreign charter operator may elect, in lieu of furnishing a security agreement as provided under paragraph (a) of this section, to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, as follows:
              (1) The charter operator shall furnish a security agreement in an amount of at least $10,000 times the number of flights, except that the amount need not be more than $200,000. The liability of the securer to any charter participant shall not exceed the amount paid by the participant to the charter operator for that charter.
              (2) The direct air carrier and charter operator or foreign charter operator shall enter into an agreement with a designated bank, the terms of which shall provide that all payments by charter participants paid to charter operators or foreign charter operators and their retail travel agents shall be deposited with and maintained by the bank subject to the following conditions:
              (i) On sales made to charter participants by charter operators or foreign charter operators the participant shall pay by check, money order, or credit card draft payable to the bank; 2
                 on sales made to charter participants by retail travel agents, the retail travel agent may deduct his commission and remit the balance to the designated bank by check, money order, or electronic transfer: Provided, That the travel agent agrees in writing with the charter operator or foreign charter operator that if the charter is canceled the travel agent shall remit to the bank the full amount of the commission previously deducted or received within 10 days after receipt of notification of cancellation of the charter; except for the credit card company's usual commission (not to exceed 3 percent), the charter operator shall not permit any portion of a charter participant's payments by credit cared to be “held back” by the credit card merchant bank; 3

                  3 “Holdback” is an amount in excess of usual commissions that a credit card merchant bank sometimes retains to cover potential charge-backs or other charges.
              
              (ii) The bank shall pay the direct air carrier the charter price for the transportation not earlier than 60 days (including day of departure) prior to the scheduled day of departure of the originating or returning flight, upon certification of the departure date by the air carrier: Provided, That, in the case of a round trip charter contract to be performed by one carrier, the total round trip charter price shall be paid to the carrier not earlier than 60 days prior to the scheduled day of departure of the originating flight;
              (iii) The bank shall reimburse the charter operator or foreign charter operator for refunds made by the latter to the charter participant upon written notification from the charter operator or foreign charter operator;
              (iv) If the charter operator, foreign charter operator or the direct air carrier notifies the bank that a charter has been canceled, the bank shall make applicable refunds directly to the charter participants;

              (v) After the charter price has been paid in full to the direct air carrier, the bank shall pay funds from the account directly to the hotels, sightseeing enterprises, or other persons or companies furnishing ground accommodations and services, if any, in connection with the charter or series of charters upon presentation to the bank of vendors' bills and upon certification by the charter operator or foreign charter operator of the amounts payable for such ground accommodations and services and the person or companies to whom payment is to be made: Provided, however, That the total amounts paid by the bank pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) (ii) and (v) of this section shall not exceed either the total cost of the air transportation, or 80 percent of the total deposits received by the bank less any refunds made to charter participants pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) (ii) and (iv) of this section, whichever is greater;
              (vi) As used in this section, the term “bank” means a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
              (vii) The bank shall maintain a separate accounting for each charter group;
              (viii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the amount of total cash deposits required to be maintained in the depository account of the bank may be reduced by one or both of the following: The amount of the security agreement in the form prescribed in this section in excess of the minimum coverage required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section; an escrow with the designated bank of Federal, State, or municipal bonds or other securities, consisting of certificates of deposit issued by banks having a stated policy of redeeming such certificates before maturity at the request of the holder (subject only to such interest penalties or other conditions as may be required by law), or negotiable securities which are publicly traded on a securities exchange, all such securities to be made payable to the escrow account: Provided, That such other securities shall be substituted in an amount no greater than 80 percent of the total market value of the escrow account at the time of such substitution: And provided, further, That should the market value of such other securities subsequently decrease, from time to time, then additional cash or securities qualified for investment hereunder shall promptly be added to the escrow account, in an amount equal to the amount of such decreased value; and
              (ix) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i), (iii), (iv), (v), and (viii) of this section, the bank shall not pay out any funds from the account prior to 2 banking days after completion of each charter, when the balance in the account shall be paid the charter operator or foreign charter operator, upon certification of the completion date by the direct air carrier: Provided, however, That if the Charter involves air transportation only and the bank has paid the direct air carrier(s) the charter price for the originating flight, and the returning flight if any, and has paid all refunds due to participants, as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) and (iii), respectively, of this section, then the bank may pay the balance in the account to the charter operator upon certification by the direct air carrier performing the originating flight that such flight has in fact departed.
              (c)(1) The security agreement required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall insure the financial responsibility of the charter operator or foreign charter operator and the supplying of the transportation and all other accommodations, services, and facilities in accordance with the contract between the charter operator or foreign charter operator and the charter participants.
              (2) The security agreement may be either:
              (i) A surety bond in the form set forth as appendix A to this part;
              (ii) A surety trust agreement in the form set forth as appendix B to this part; or

              (iii) An arrangement with a bank (for instance, a standby letter of credit) that provides protection of charter participants' funds equivalent to or greater than that provided by the Bond in appendix A. An arrangement that furnishes a lesser degree of protection than would be provided under the bond shall be invalid to that extent, and instead the bank, the charter operator or foreign charter operator, and the charter participants shall have the same rights and liabilities as provided under a bond in the form of appendix A. If the arrangement does not give as much protection as a bond against the risk of the charter operator's bankruptcy, the bank shall be liable in the event of bankruptcy to the same extent as if it had entered into a bond.
              (3) Any agreement under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section shall include a statement that, in the event that the other provisions of the agreement do not provide protection to charter participants comparable to that provided under a bond in the form of appendix A, the bank shall assume, for the benefit of the charter participants, all the liabilities it would have if it entered into the bond.
              (4) The security agreement shall be effective on or before the date the charter prospectus is filed with the Department.
              (5) The security agreement shall be specifically identified by the issuing securer with a numbering system so that the Department can identify the security agreement with the specific charter or charters to which it relates. These data may be set forth in an addendum attached to the security agreement, which addendum must be signed by the charter operator or foreign charter operator and the securer.
              (6) When security is provided by a surety bond, such bond shall be issued by a bonding or surety company that is listed in Best's Insurance Reports (Fire and Casualty) with a general policyholders' rating of “A” or better. The bonding or surety company shall be one legally authorized to issue bonds of that type in the State in which the charter originates. For purposes of this section the term “State” includes any territory or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia.
              (7) When security is provided by a security agreement other than a bond, the agreement shall be issued by a national bank complying with the provisions of 12 CFR 7.7010(a), or by a State bank complying with applicable State laws that give authority to issue such agreements, and all such banks must be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
              (d) The security agreement required by this section shall provide that unless the charter participant files a claim with the charter operator or foreign charter operator, or, if it is unavailable, with the securer, within 60 days after termination of the charter, the securer shall be released from all liability under the security agreement to such charter participant. Terminations means the date of arrival (or in the case of a canceled charter, the intended date of arrival) of the return flight. If there is no return flight in a participant's itinerary, termination means the date or intended date of departure of the last flight in the participant's itinerary.
            
            
              § 380.34a
              Substitution of direct air carrier's security or depository agreement.
              (a) A direct air carrier may substitute its own security agreement and/or depository arrangements, as specified in this section, for those required of the charter operator under § 380.34, but only for charter trips in which all the air transportation is provided by one direct air carrier. Charter operators are relieved from § 380.34 to the extent that the direct carrier substitutes its own arrangements.
              (b) The direct air carrier may substitute its security agreement for all of the arrangements required of the charter operator under § 380.34 (a) or (b). Alternatively, it may substitute its depository agreement for the depository agreement required of the charter operator under § 380.34(b)(2). If the direct carrier substitutes its depository agreement, it may also obtain and substitute a security agreement for the one otherwise required of the charter operator under § 380.34(b)(1). If the direct carrier substitutes its depository agreement only, the charter operator must supply the security agreement required under § 380.34(b)(1).
              (c) If the direct carrier substitutes a security agreement for all the charter operator's requirements under § 380.34, the charter operator shall include in the charter prospectus, in place of the information in § 380.28(a)(2) regarding the charter operator's security agreement:

              (1) A statement by the direct air carrier on OST Form 4535 that it will take responsibility for all charter participant payments (including those for ground accommodations and services) and for the fulfillment of all the charter operator's contractual and regulatory obligations to the charter participants.
              (2) A statement from the direct air carrier and its securer (under § 212.12 of this chapter), OST Form 4533, that they have entered into a security agreement assuring the direct air carrier's responsibilities to charter participants under this section in an unlimited amount (except that the liability of the securer with respect to any charter participant may be limited to the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant), and that the securer has received a copy of the proposed flight schedule identified by the schedule number assigned by the charter operator under this part.
              (d) A substitute depository agreement under this section shall be signed by the direct air carrier, the charter operator, and the depository bank, and shall provide, in addition to existing requirements under § 212.8 of this chapter, that:
              (1) Payments by or on behalf of charter participants shall be allocated to the flight accounts matching the participant's itinerary in the following way: Each account shall have allocated to it the charter cost of the participant's air transportation on that flight. The portion of each payment not intended for air transportation services shall be allocated to the account for the return flight in the participant's itinerary. If there is only one flight in the itinerary, the entire payment shall be allocated to that account.
              (2) The bank shall pay funds from a flight account directly to the hotels, sightseeing enterprises, or other persons or companies furnishing ground accommodations and services, if any, in connection with the charter flight, upon presentation to the bank of vendor's bills and upon certification by the person who contracted for the ground accommodations or services of the amounts payable and the persons or companies to whom payment is to be made, except that no disbursement shall be made that would reduce the balance in the account below the charter cost of the flight.
              (3) On sales made to participants by a person other than a retail travel agent, the participant shall pay by check, money order, or credit card draft payable to the bank. On sales made to participants by a retail travel agent, payments shall be made in the same manner unless the agent deducts its commission and remits the balance to the bank by check, money order, or electronic transfer. The agent may deduct its commission only if it agrees in writing with its principal (the charter operator or direct air carrier, as applicable) that, if the charter is canceled, the agent shall remit to the bank the full amount of the commission previously deducted or received within 10 days after receipt of notification of the cancellation. The depository bank shall pay refunds directly to participants according to the terms of the operator-participant contract and the terms of this part.
              (e) If the direct carrier substitutes a security agreement in addition to substituting a depository agreement, the charter prospectus information must include all the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, except for the amount of the security agreement. That agreement shall be in an amount of at least $10,000 times the number of flights, except that the amount need not be more than $200,000.
              (f) A copy of the depository agreement under paragraph (d) of this section shall be filed with the Department, and it shall not be effective until approved by the Department.
              (g) A copy of the security agreement under paragraph (c) or paragraph (e) of this section shall be filed with the Department. It shall insure the financial responsibility of the direct air carrier for supplying the transportation and all other accommodations, services, and facilities in accordance with the contracts between the charter operator and the charter participants. Such security agreement shall meet all the other requirements of § 380.34 (c) and (d).
            
            
              § 380.35
              Disbursements from depository account.

              No charter operator or direct air carrier shall cause its agents or the depository bank to make disbursements or payments from deposits except in accordance with the provisions of this part.
            
            
              § 380.36
              Record retention.
              Every charter operator conducting a charter pursuant to this part shall comply with the applicable record-retention provisions of part 249 of this chapter.

              (b) For foreign-originating Public Charters organized by foreign charter operators: A direct air carrier shall not perform air transportation in connection with such a charter unless—

              Cancellations by direct air carriers.
              The direct air carrier shall not cancel any charter under this part less than 10 days before the scheduled departure date, except for circumstances that make it physically impossible to perform the charter trip.
            
            
              § 380.45
              Suspension of exemption authority.

              Pt. 380, App. A
              Appendix A to Part 380—Public Charter Operator's Surety Bond Under Part 380 of the Special Regulations of the Department of Transportation (14 CFR Part 380)
              Know all men by these presents, that we __________ (name of charter operator) of __________, (city) __________ (state or country) as Principal (hereinafter called Principal), and__________ (name of surety) a corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of __________ (State) as Surety (hereinafter called Surety) are held and firmly bound unto the United States of America in the sum of $__________ (see § 380.34(f) of Part 380) for which payment, well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.
              Whereas Principal intends to become a Public Charter operator pursuant to the provisions of part 380 of the Department's Special Regulations and other rules and regulations of the Department relating to insurance or other security for the protection of charter participants, and has elected to file with the Department of Transportation such a bond as will insure financial responsibility with respect to all moneys received from charter participants for services in connection with a Public Charter to be operated subject to Part 380 of the Department's Special Regulations in accordance with contracts, agreements, or arrangements therefor, and
              Whereas this bond is written to assure compliance by Principal as an authorized charter operator with Part 380 of the Department's Special Regulations, and other rules and regulations of the Department relating to insurance and other security for the protection of charter participants, and shall inure to the benefit of any and all charter participants to whom Principal may be held legally liable for any damages herein described.
              Now, therefor, the condition of this obligation is such that if Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to charter participants any sum or sums for which Principal may be held legally liable by reason of Principal's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill and carry out all contracts, agreements, and arrangements made by Principal while this bond is in effect with respect to the receipt of moneys from charter participants, and proper disbursement thereof pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Part 380 of the Department's Special Regulations, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.
              The liability of Surety with respect to any charter participant shall not exceed the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant.
              The liability of Surety shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder, unless and until such payment or payments shall amount in the aggregate to the penalty of the bond, but in no event shall Surety's obligation hereunder exceed the amount of said penalty.
              Surety agrees to furnish written notice to the Office of Aviation Analysis, Department of Transportation, forthwith of all suits or claims filed and judgments rendered, and payments made by Surety under this bond.
              The bond shall cover the following charters: 1

              Place of flight departure
              
              This bond is effective on the ___ day of ____, 12:01 a.m., standard time at the address of Principal as stated herein and as hereinafter provided.

If the two parties agree that the operator will attempt to acquire an event ticket, the agreement shall specify any penalties that will apply if the individual later cancels because an event ticket did not become available. If the operator notifies this person that an event ticket has become available, that person shall enjoy all the other protections of this part from that time.

              [Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 78 FR 67914, Nov. 12, 2013]
            
            
              § 382.5
              When are U.S. and foreign carriers required to begin complying with the provisions of this part?
              As a U.S. or foreign carrier, you are required to comply with the requirements of this part on May 13, 2009, except as otherwise provided in individual sections of this part.
            
            
              § 382.7
              To whom do the provisions of this part apply?
              (a) If you are a U.S. carrier, this Part applies to you with respect to all your operations and aircraft, regardless of where your operations take place, except as otherwise provided in this part.

              (b) If you are a foreign carrier, this part applies to you only with respect to flights you operate that begin or end at a U.S. airport and to aircraft used for these flights. For purposes of this part, a “flight” means a continuous journey in the same aircraft or with one flight number that begins or ends at a U.S. airport. The following are some examples of the application of this term:
              
              
                Example 1 to paragraph (b):
                A passenger books a nonstop flight on a foreign carrier from New York to Frankfurt, or Frankfurt to New York. Each of these is a “flight” for purposes of this Part.
              
              
                Example 2 to paragraph (b):
                A passenger books a journey on a foreign carrier from New York to Prague. The foreign carrier flies nonstop to Frankfurt. The passenger gets off the plane in Frankfurt and boards a connecting flight (with a different flight number), on the same foreign carrier or a different carrier, which goes to Prague. The New York-Frankfurt leg of the journey is a “flight” for purposes of this Part; the Frankfurt-Prague leg is not. On the reverse routing, the Prague-Frankfurt leg is not a covered flight for purposes of this Part, while the Frankfurt-New York leg is.
              
              
                Example 3 to paragraph (b):
                A passenger books a journey on a foreign carrier from New York to Prague. The plane stops for refueling and a crew change in Frankfurt. If, after deplaning in Frankfurt, the passengers originating in New York reboard the aircraft (or a different aircraft, assuming the flight number remains the same) and continue to Prague, they remain on a covered flight for purposes of this Part. This is because their transportation takes place on a direct flight between New York and Prague, even though it had an interim stop in Frankfurt. This example would also apply in the opposite direction (Prague to New York via Frankfurt).
              
              
                Example 4 to paragraph (b):
                In Example 3, the foreign carrier is not subject to coverage under this Part with respect to a Frankfurt-originating passenger who boards the aircraft and goes to Prague, or a Prague-originating passenger who gets off the plane in Frankfurt and does not continue to New York.
              
              

              (c) As a foreign carrier, you are not subject to the requirements of this part with respect to flights between two foreign points, even with respect to flights involving code-sharing arrangements with U.S. carriers. As a U.S. carrier that participates in a code-sharing arrangement with a foreign carrier with respect to flights between two foreign points, you (as distinct from the foreign carrier) are responsible for ensuring compliance with the service provisions of subparts A through C, F through H, and K with respect to passengers traveling under your code on such a flight.
              
              
                Example 1 to paragraph (c):

                A passenger buys a ticket from a U.S. carrier for a journey from New York to Prague. The ticket carries the U.S. carrier's code and flight number throughout the entire journey. There is a change of carrier and aircraft in Frankfurt, and a foreign carrier operates the Frankfurt-Prague segment. The foreign carrier is not subject to the provisions of Part 382 for the Frankfurt-Prague segment. However, the U.S. carrier must ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of Part 382 on the Frankfurt-Prague segment with respect to passengers flying under its code, and the Department could take enforcement action against the U.S. carrier for acts or omissions by the foreign carrier.
              
              
              (d) As a foreign carrier, if you operate a charter flight from a foreign airport to a U.S. airport, and return to a foreign airport, and you do not pick up any passengers in the U.S., the charter flight is not a flight subject to the requirements of this part.
              (e) Unless a provision of this Part specifies application to a U.S. carrier or a foreign carrier, the provision applies to both U.S. and foreign carriers.
              (f) If you are an indirect carrier, §§ 382.1 through 382.15 of this part apply to you. §§ 382.17 through 382.157 of this part do not apply to you except insofar as provided by § 382.11(b).
              (g) Notwithstanding any provisions of this part, you must comply with all FAA safety regulations, TSA security regulations, and foreign safety and security regulations having legally mandatory effect that apply to you.
              [Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009; 75 FR 44887, July 30, 2010]
            
            
              § 382.9
              What may foreign carriers do if they believe a provision of a foreign nation's law conflicts with compliance with a provision of this part?
              (a) If you are a foreign carrier, and you believe that an applicable provision of the law of a foreign nation precludes you from complying with a provision of this part, you may request a waiver of the provision of this Part.
              (b) You must send such a waiver request to the following address: Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings, C-70 U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Room W96-322, Washington, DC 20590.
              (c) Your waiver request must be in English and include the following elements:
              (1) A copy, in the English language, of the foreign law involved;
              (2) A description of how the foreign law applies and how it precludes compliance with a provision of this part;
              (3) A description of the alternative means the carrier will use, if the waiver is granted, to effectively achieve the objective of the provision of this part subject to the waiver or, if applicable, a justification of why it would be impossible to achieve this objective in any way.
              (d) The Department may grant the waiver request, or grant the waiver request subject to conditions, if it determines that the foreign law applies, that it does preclude compliance with a provision of this part, and that the carrier has provided an effective alternative means of achieving the objective of the provisions of this part subject to the waiver or have demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would be impossible to achieve this objective in any way.
              (e)(1) If you submit a waiver request on or before September 10, 2008, the Department will, to the maximum extent feasible, respond to the request before May 13, 2009. If the Department does not respond to the waiver request by May 13, 2009, you may continue to implement the policy or practice that is the subject of your request until the Department does respond. The Department will not take enforcement action with respect to your implementation of the policy or practice during the time prior to the Department's response.
              (2) If you submit a waiver request after September 10, 2008, the Department will, to the maximum extent feasible, respond to the request by May 13, 2009 or within 180 days of receiving it, whichever is later. If the Department does not respond to the waiver request by this date, you may continue to implement the policy or practice that is the subject of your request until the Department does respond. However, the Department may take enforcement action with respect to your implementation of the policy or practice during the time between May 13, 2009 and the date of the Department's response.

              (3) If you submit a waiver request after September 10, 2008, and the request pertains to an applicable provision of the law of a foreign nation that did not exist on September 10, 2008, you may continue to implement the policy or practice that is the subject of your request until the Department responds to the request. The Department will, to the maximum extent feasible, respond to such requests within 180 days of receiving them. The Department will not take enforcement action with respect to your implementation of the policy or practice during the time prior to the Department's response.
              (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Department may commence enforcement action at any time after May 13, 2009 with respect to the policy or practice that is the subject of the request if it finds the request to be frivolous or dilatory.
              (g) If you have not submitted a request for a waiver under this section with respect to a provision of this part, or such a request has been denied, you cannot raise the alleged existence of such a conflict as a defense to an enforcement action.
            
            
              § 382.10
              How does a U.S. or foreign carrier obtain a determination that it is providing an equivalent alternative to passengers with disabilities?
              (a) As a U.S. or foreign carrier, you may apply to the Department for a determination that you are providing an equivalent alternative to passengers with disabilities.
              (b) You must send your application for an equivalent alternative determination to the following address: Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings (C-70), U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Room W96-322, Washington, DC 20590.
              (c) Your application must be in English and include the following elements:
              (1) A citation to the specific provision of this part concerning which you are proposing an equivalent alternative.
              (2) A detailed description of the alternative policy, practice, or other accommodation you are proposing to use in place of compliance with the provision of this part that you cite, and an explanation of how it provides substantially equivalent accessibility to passengers with disabilities.
              (d) The Department may grant the application, or grant the application subject to conditions, if it determines that the proposed facilitation does provide substantially equivalent accessibility to passengers with disabilities, compared to compliance with the provision of this part in question.
              (e) If your application is granted, you will be deemed to be in compliance with this Part through implementing the equivalent alternative. If your application is denied, you must implement this part as written.
              (f)(1) If you submit your application on or before September 10, 2008, the Department will respond to the request before May 13, 2009 to the maximum extent feasible. If the Department does not respond to the application by May 13, 2009, you may implement your policy or practice that is the subject of your application until the Department does respond.
              (2) With respect to an application you make after September 10, 2008, you must comply with the provisions of this part without change from May 13, 2009 until the Department responds to your application.
            
          
          
            Subpart B—Nondiscrimination and Access to Services and Information
            
              § 382.11
              What is the general nondiscrimination requirement of this part?
              (a) As a carrier, you must not do any of the following things, either directly or through a contractual, licensing, or other arrangement:
              (1) You must not discriminate against any qualified individual with a disability, by reason of such disability, in the provision of air transportation;
              (2) You must not require a qualified individual with a disability to accept special services (including, but not limited to, preboarding) that the individual does not request. However, you may require preboarding as a condition of receiving certain seating or in-cabin stowage accommodations, as specified in §§ 382.83(c), 382.85(b), and 382.123(a) of this part.

              (3) You must not exclude a qualified individual with a disability from or deny the person the benefit of any air transportation or related services that are available to other persons, except where specifically permitted by this Part. This is true even if there are separate or different services available for individuals with a disability, except when specifically permitted by another section of this Part; and
              (4) You must not take any adverse action against an individual (e.g., refusing to provide transportation) because the individual asserts, on his or her own behalf or through or on behalf of others, rights protected by this part or the Air Carrier Access Act.
              (b) As an indirect carrier, you must comply with §§ 382.17 through 382.157 of this part when providing facilities or services to passengers that would have otherwise been provided by a direct air carrier.

              § 382.13
              Do carriers have to modify policies, practices, and facilities to ensure nondiscrimination?
              (a) As a carrier, you must modify your policies, practices, and facilities when needed to provide nondiscriminatory service to a particular individual with a disability, consistent with the standards of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended.
              (b) This requirement is part of your general nondiscrimination obligation, and is in addition to your duty to make the specific accommodations required by this part.
              (c) However, you are not required to make modifications that would constitute an undue burden or would fundamentally alter your program.
            
            
              § 382.15
              Do carriers have to make sure that contractors comply with the requirements of this Part?
              (a) As a carrier, you must make sure that your contractors that provide services to the public (including airports where applicable) meet the requirements of this part that would apply to you if you provided the services yourself.
              (b) As a carrier, you must include an assurance of compliance with this part in your contracts with any contractors that provide services to the public that are subject to the requirements of this part. Noncompliance with this assurance is a material breach of the contract on the contractor's part.
              (1) This assurance must commit the contractor to compliance with all applicable provisions of this Part in activities performed on behalf of the carrier.
              (2) The assurance must also commit the contractor to implementing directives issued by your CROs under §§ 382.151 through 382.153.
              (c) As a U.S. carrier, you must also include such an assurance of compliance in your contracts or agreements of appointment with U.S. travel agents. You are not required to include such an assurance in contracts with foreign travel agents.
              (d) You remain responsible for your contractors' compliance with this part and for enforcing the assurances in your contracts with them.
              (e) It is not a defense against an enforcement action by the Department under this part that your noncompliance resulted from action or inaction by a contractor.
            
            
              § 382.17
              May carriers limit the number of passengers with a disability on a flight?
              As a carrier, you must not limit the number of passengers with a disability who travel on a flight. (See also § 382.27(c)(6) of this part.)
              [Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009]
            
            
              § 382.19
              May carriers refuse to provide transportation on the basis of disability?
              (a) As a carrier, you must not refuse to provide transportation to a passenger with a disability on the basis of his or her disability, except as specifically permitted by this part.
              (b) You must not refuse to provide transportation to a passenger with a disability because the person's disability results in appearance or involuntary behavior that may offend, annoy, or inconvenience crewmembers or other passengers.

              (c) You may refuse to provide transportation to any passenger on the basis of safety, as provided in 49 U.S.C. 44902 or 14 CFR 121.533, or to any passenger whose carriage would violate FAA or TSA requirements or applicable requirements of a foreign government.
              (1) You can determine that there is a disability-related safety basis for refusing to provide transportation to a passenger with a disability if you are able to demonstrate that the passenger poses a direct threat (see definition in § 382.3). In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat, you must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain:
              (i) The nature, duration, and severity of the risk;
              (ii) The probability that the potential harm to the health and safety of others will actually occur; and
              (iii) Whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.
              (2) If you determine that the passenger does pose a direct threat, you must select the least restrictive response from the point of view of the passenger, consistent with protecting the health and safety of others. For example, you must not refuse transportation to the passenger if you can protect the health and safety of others by means short of a refusal.
              (3) In exercising this authority, you must not act inconsistently with the provisions of this part.
              (4) If your actions are inconsistent with any of the provisions of this part, you are subject to enforcement action under Subpart K of this part.
              (d) If you refuse to provide transportation to a passenger on his or her originally-scheduled flight on a basis relating to the individual's disability, you must provide to the person a written statement of the reason for the refusal. This statement must include the specific basis for the carrier's opinion that the refusal meets the standards of paragraph (c) of this section or is otherwise specifically permitted by this part. You must provide this written statement to the person within 10 calendar days of the refusal of transportation.
            
            
              § 382.21
              May carriers limit access to transportation on the basis that a passenger has a communicable disease or other medical condition?
              (a) You must not do any of the following things on the basis that a passenger has a communicable disease or infection, unless you determine that the passenger's condition poses a direct threat:
              (1) Refuse to provide transportation to the passenger;
              (2) Delay the passenger's transportation (e.g., require the passenger to take a later flight);
              (3) Impose on the passenger any condition, restriction, or requirement not imposed on other passengers; or
              (4) Require the passenger to provide a medical certificate.
              (b) In assessing whether the passenger's condition poses a direct threat, you must apply the provisions of § 382.19(c)(1)-(2) of this subpart.
              (1) In making this assessment, you may rely on directives issued by public health authorities (e.g., the U.S. Centers for Disease Control or Public Health Service; comparable agencies in other countries; the World Health Organization).

              (2) In making this assessment, you must consider the significance of the consequences of a communicable disease and the degree to which it can be readily transmitted by casual contact in an aircraft cabin environment.
              
              
                Example 1 to paragraph (b)(2):
                The common cold is readily transmissible in an aircraft cabin environment but does not have severe health consequences. Someone with a cold would not pose a direct threat.
              
              
                Example 2 to paragraph (b)(2):
                AIDS has very severe health consequences but is not readily transmissible in an aircraft cabin environment. Someone would not pose a direct threat because he or she is HIV-positive or has AIDS.
              
              
                Example 3 to paragraph (b)(2):
                SARS may be readily transmissible in an aircraft cabin environment and has severe health consequences. Someone with SARS probably poses a direct threat.
              
              

              (c) If a passenger with a communicable disease meeting the direct threat criteria of this section gives you a medical certificate of the kind outlined in § 382.23(c)(2) describing measures for preventing transmission of the disease during the normal course of the flight, you must provide transportation to the passenger, unless you are unable to carry out the measures.
              (d) If your action under this section results in the postponement of a passenger's travel, you must permit the passenger to travel at a later time (up to 90 days from the date of the postponed travel) at the fare that would have applied to the passenger's originally scheduled trip without penalty or, at the passenger's discretion, provide a refund for any unused flights, including return flights.
              (e) If you take any action under this section that restricts a passenger's travel, you must, on the passenger's request, provide a written explanation within 10 days of the request.
            
            
              § 382.23
              May carriers require a passenger with a disability to provide a medical certificate?
              (a) Except as provided in this section, you must not require a passenger with a disability to have a medical certificate as a condition for being provided transportation.
              (b)(1) You may require a medical certificate for a passenger with a disability—
              (i) Who is traveling in a stretcher or incubator;
              (ii) Who needs medical oxygen during a flight; or
              (iii) Whose medical condition is such that there is reasonable doubt that the individual can complete the flight safely, without requiring extraordinary medical assistance during the flight.
              (2) For purposes of this paragraph, a medical certificate is a written statement from the passenger's physician saying that the passenger is capable of completing the flight safely, without requiring extraordinary medical assistance during the flight.

              (3) To be valid, a medical certificate under this paragraph must be dated within 10 days of the scheduled date of the passenger's initial departing flight.
              
              
                Example to paragraph (b)(3):
                A passenger who schedules a flight from New York to London on January 15 with a return on April 15 would have to show a medical certificate dated January 5 or later. The passenger would not have to show a second medical certificate dated April 5 or later.
              
              
              (c)(1) You may also require a medical certificate for a passenger if he or she has a communicable disease or condition that could pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others on the flight.
              (2) For purposes of this paragraph, a medical certificate is a written statement from the passenger's physician saying that the disease or infection would not, under the present conditions in the particular passenger's case, be communicable to other persons during the normal course of a flight. The medical certificate must state any conditions or precautions that would have to be observed to prevent the transmission of the disease or infection to other persons in the normal course of a flight. A medical certificate under this paragraph must be dated within 10 days of the date of the flight for which it is presented.

              (d) As a carrier, you may require that a passenger with a medical certificate undergo additional medical review by you if there is a legitimate medical reason for believing that there has been a significant adverse change in the passenger's condition since the issuance of the medical certificate or that the certificate significantly understates the passenger's risk to the health of other persons on the flight. If the results of this medical review demonstrate that the passenger, notwithstanding the medical certificate, is likely to be unable to complete the flight without requiring extraordinary medical assistance (e.g., the passenger has apparent significant difficulty in breathing, appears to be in substantial pain, etc.) or would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other persons on the flight, you may take an action otherwise prohibited under § 382.21(a) of this part.

              § 382.25
              May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice that he or she is traveling on a flight?
              As a carrier, you must not require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice of the fact that he or she is traveling on a flight.
            
            
              
              § 382.27
              May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice in order to obtain certain specific services in connection with a flight?
              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and § 382.133(e)(4) and (5) and (f)(5) and (6), as a carrier you must not require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice in order to obtain services or accommodations required by this part.
              (b) You may require a passenger with a disability to provide up to 72 hours' advance notice and check in one hour before the check-in time for the general public to receive carrier-supplied in-flight medical oxygen on international flights, 48 hours' advance notice and check-in one hour before the check-in time for the general public to receive carrier-supplied in-flight medical oxygen on domestic flights, and 48 hours' advance notice and check-in one hour before the check-in time for the general public to use his/her ventilator, respirator, CPAP machine or POC.
              (c) You may require a passenger with a disability to provide up to 48 hours' advance notice and check in one hour before the check-in time for the general public to receive the following services and accommodations. The services listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section are optional; you are not required to provide them, but you may choose to do so.
              (1) Carriage of an incubator;
              (2) Hook-up for a respirator, ventilator, CPAP machine or POC to the aircraft electrical power supply;
              (3) Accommodation for a passenger who must travel in a stretcher;
              (4) Transportation for an electric wheelchair on an aircraft with fewer than 60 seats;
              (5) Provision of hazardous materials packaging for batteries or other assistive devices that are required to have such packaging;
              (6) Accommodation for a group of ten or more qualified individuals with a disability, who make reservations and travel as a group; and
              (7) Provision of an on-board wheelchair on an aircraft with more than 60 seats that does not have an accessible lavatory.
              (8) Transportation of an emotional support or psychiatric service animal in the cabin;
              (9) Transportation of a service animal on a flight segment scheduled to take 8 hours or more;
              (10) Accommodation of a passenger who has both severe vision and hearing impairments (see § 382.29(b)(4)).
              (d) If the passenger with a disability provides the advance notice you require, consistent with this section, for a service that you must provide (see paragraphs (c)(4) through (c)(10) of this section) or choose to provide (see paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section), you must provide the requested service or accommodation.
              (e) Your reservation and other administrative systems must ensure that when passengers provide the advance notice that you require, consistent with this section, for services and accommodations, the notice is communicated, clearly and on time, to the people responsible for providing the requested service or accommodation.
              (f) If a passenger with a disability provides the advance notice you require, consistent with this section, and the passenger is forced to change to another flight (e.g., because of a flight cancellation), you must, to the maximum extent feasible, provide the accommodation on the new flight. If the new flight is another carrier's flight, you must provide the maximum feasible assistance to the other carrier in providing the accommodation the passenger requested from you.
              (g) If a passenger does not meet advance notice or check-in requirements you establish consistent with this section, you must still provide the service or accommodation if you can do so by making reasonable efforts, without delaying the flight.

              § 382.29
              May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to travel with a safety assistant?

              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, you must not require that a passenger with a disability travel with another person as a condition of being provided air transportation.
              (b) You may require a passenger with a disability in one of the following categories to travel with a safety assistant as a condition of being provided air transportation, if you determine that a safety assistant is essential for safety:
              (1) A passenger traveling in a stretcher or incubator. The safety assistant for such a person must be capable of attending to the passenger's in-flight medical needs;
              (2) A passenger who, because of a mental disability, is unable to comprehend or respond appropriately to safety instructions from carrier personnel, including the safety briefing required by 14 CFR 121.571(a)(3) and (a)(4) or 14 CFR 135.117(b) or the safety regulations of a foreign carrier's government, as applicable;
              (3) A passenger with a mobility impairment so severe that the person is unable to physically assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft;
              (4) A passenger who has both severe hearing and severe vision impairments, if the passenger cannot establish some means of communication with carrier personnel that is adequate both to permit transmission of the safety briefing required by 14 CFR 121.57(a)(3) and (a)(4), 14 CFR 135,117(b) or the safety regulations of a foreign carrier's government, as applicable, and to enable the passenger to assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft in the event of an emergency. You may require a passenger with severe hearing and vision impairment who wishes to travel without a safety assistant to notify you at least 48 hours in advance to provide this explanation. If the passenger fails to meet this notice requirement, however, you must still accommodate him or her to the extent practicable.
              (c)(1) If you determine that a person meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section must travel with a safety assistant, contrary to the individual's self-assessment that he or she is capable of traveling independently, you must not charge for the transportation of the safety assistant. You are not required to find or provide the safety assistant, however.
              (2) For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, you may require, contrary to the individual's self-assessment, that an individual with both severe hearing and vision impairments must travel with a safety assistant if you determine that—
              (i) The means of communication that the individual has explained to you does not adequately satisfy the objectives identified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; or
              (ii) The individual proposes to establish communication by means of finger spelling and you cannot, within the time following the individual's notification, arrange for a flight crew member who can communicate using this method to serve the passenger's flight.
              (3) If a passenger voluntarily chooses to travel with a personal care attendant or safety assistant that you do not require, you may charge for the transportation of that person.
              (d) If, because there is not a seat available on a flight for a safety assistant whom the carrier has determined to be necessary, a passenger with a disability holding a confirmed reservation is unable to travel on the flight, you must compensate the passenger with a disability in an amount to be calculated as provided for instances of involuntary denied boarding under 14 CFR part 250, where part 250 applies.
              (e) For purposes of determining whether a seat is available for a safety assistant, you must deem the safety assistant to have checked in at the same time as the passenger with a disability.
              (f) Concern that a passenger with a disability may need personal care services (e.g., assistance in using lavatory facilities or with eating) is not a basis for requiring the passenger to travel with a safety assistant. You must explain this clearly in training or information you provide to your employees. You may advise passengers that your personnel are not required to provide such services.
            
            
              
              § 382.31
              May carriers impose special charges on passengers with a disability for providing services and accommodations required by this rule?
              (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part you must not, as a carrier, impose charges for providing facilities, equipment, or services that this rule requires to be provided to passengers with a disability. You may charge for services that this part does not require.
              (b) You may charge a passenger for the use of more than one seat if the passenger's size or condition (e.g., use of a stretcher) causes him or her to occupy the space of more than one seat. This is not considered a special charge under this section.

              § 382.33
              May carriers impose other restrictions on passengers with a disability that they do not impose on other passengers?

              (a) As a carrier, you must not subject passengers with a disability to restrictions that do not apply to other passengers, except as otherwise permitted in this part (e.g., advance notice requirements for certain services permitted by § 382.27).
              (b) Restrictions you must not impose on passengers with a disability include, but are not limited to, the following:
              (1) Restricting passengers” movement within the terminal;
              (2) Requiring passengers to remain in a holding area or other location in order to receive transportation, services, or accommodations;
              (3) Making passengers sit on blankets on the aircraft;

              (4) Making passengers wear badges or other special identification (e.g., similar to badges worn by unaccompanied minors); or
              (5) Otherwise mandating separate treatment for passengers with a disability, unless permitted or required by this part or other applicable Federal requirements.
            
            
              § 382.35
              May carriers require passengers with a disability to sign waivers or releases?
              (a) As a carrier, you must not require passengers with a disability to sign a release or waiver of liability in order to receive transportation or to receive services or accommodations for a disability.
              (b) You must not require passengers with a disability to sign waivers of liability for damage to or loss of wheelchairs or other assistive devices, or for the loss of, death of, or injury to service animals. Carriers may note pre-existing damage to an assistive device to the same extent that carriers do this with respect to other checked baggage.
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Information for Passengers
            
              § 382.41
              What flight-related information must carriers provide to qualified individuals with a disability?

              As a carrier, you must provide the following information, on request, to qualified individuals with a disability or persons making inquiries on their behalf concerning the accessibility of the aircraft expected to make a particular flight. The information you provide must be specific to the aircraft you expect to use for the flight unless it is unfeasible for you to do so (e.g., because unpredictable circumstances such as weather or a mechanical problem require substitution of another aircraft that could affect the location or availability of an accommodation). The required information is:

              (a) The specific location of seats, if any, with movable armrests (i.e., by row and seat number);
              (b) The specific location of seats (i.e., by row and seat number) that the carrier, consistent with this part, does not make available to passengers with a disability (e.g., exit row seats);

              (c) Any aircraft-related, service-related or other limitations on the ability to accommodate passengers with a disability, including limitations on the availability of level-entry boarding to the aircraft at any airport involved with the flight. You must provide this information to any passenger who states that he or she uses a wheelchair for boarding, even if the passenger does not explicitly request the information.
              (d) Any limitations on the availability of storage facilities, in the cabin or in the cargo bay, for mobility aids or other assistive devices commonly used by passengers with a disability, including storage in the cabin of a passenger's wheelchair as provided in §§ 382.67 and 382.123 of this part;
              (e) Whether the aircraft has an accessible lavatory; and
              (f) The types of services to passengers with a disability that are or are not available on the flight.
            
            
              § 382.43
              Must information and reservation services of carriers be accessible to individuals with visual, hearing, and other disabilities?
              (a) If, as a carrier, you provide telephone reservation and information service to the public, you must make this service available to individuals who use a text telephone (TTY), whether via your own TTY, voice relay, or other available technology, as follows:
              (1) You must provide access to TTY users during the same hours as the telephone service is available to the general public.

              (2) You must ensure that the response time for answering calls and the level of service provided to TTY users is substantially equivalent to the response time and level of service provided to the general public (i.e., non-TTY users).
              (3) You must not subject TTY users to charges exceeding those that apply to non-TTY users of telephone information and reservation service.

              (4) In any medium in which you list the telephone number of your information and reservation service for the general public, you must also list your TTY number if you have one. If you do not have a TTY number, you must state how TTY users can reach your information and reservation service (e.g., via a voice relay service).
              (5) If you are a foreign carrier, you must meet this requirement by May 13, 2010.
              (b) The requirements of paragraph (a) do not apply to you in any country in which the telecommunications infrastructure does not readily permit compliance.
              (c) If you are a U.S. or foreign air carrier that operates at least one aircraft having a designed seating capacity of more than 60 passengers and owns or controls a primary Web site that markets passenger air transportation, or a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations), or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation, you must ensure the public-facing Web pages on your primary Web site are accessible to individuals with disabilities as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. Only Web sites that market air transportation to the general public in the United States must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. The following are among the characteristics of a primary Web site that markets to the general public in the U.S.: the content can be viewed in English, the site advertises or sells flights operating to, from, or within the United States, and the site displays fares in U.S. dollars.
              (1) Your primary Web site must conform to all Success Criteria and all Conformance Requirements from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation 11 December 2008, Web site Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 for Level AA as follows:
              (i) Web pages associated with obtaining the following core air travel services and information that are offered on your primary Web site are conformant by December 12, 2015:
              (A) Booking or changing a reservation, including all flight amenities;
              (B) Checking in for a flight;
              (C) Accessing a personal travel itinerary;
              (D) Accessing the status of a flight;
              (E) Accessing a personal frequent flyer account;
              (F) Accessing flight schedules; and
              (G) Accessing carrier contact information.
              (ii) All remaining Web pages on your primary Web site are conformant by December 12, 2016.

              (2) Your primary Web site must be tested in consultation with individuals with disabilities or members of disability organization(s) who use or want to use carrier Web sites to research or book air transportation in order to obtain their feedback on the Web site's accessibility and usability before the dates specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Collectively, such individuals must be able to provide feedback on the usability of the Web site by individuals with visual, auditory, tactile, and cognitive disabilities. Consultation is required to ensure that your Web site is usable by individuals with disabilities by the date specified in paragraph (c)(1).
              (3) You are permitted to use a Level AA conforming alternate version only when conforming a public-facing Web page to all WCAG 2.0 Level AA success criteria would constitute an undue burden or fundamentally alter the information or functionality provided by that page.
              (4) You must assist prospective passengers who indicate that they are unable to use your Web site due to a disability and contact you through other channels (e.g., by telephone or at the ticket counter) as follows:
              (i) Disclose Web-based discount fares to the passenger if his or her itinerary qualifies for the discounted fare.
              (ii) Provide Web-based amenities to the passenger, such as waiving any fee applicable to making a reservation or purchasing a ticket using a method other than your Web site (e.g., by telephone), unless the fee applies to other customers purchasing the same fare online.
              (d) As a carrier covered under paragraph (c) of this section, you must provide a mechanism on your primary Web site for persons with disabilities to request disability accommodation services for future flights, including but not limited to wheelchair assistance, seating accommodation, escort assistance for a visually impaired passenger, and stowage of an assistive device no later than December 12, 2015. You may require individuals who request accommodations using this mechanism to provide contact information (e.g., name, daytime phone, evening phone, and email address) for follow-up by your customer service department or medical desk.
              (e) As a carrier covered under paragraph (c) of this section, you must provide a disclaimer activated when a user clicks a link on your primary Web site to an external Web site or to third-party software informing the user that the Web site or software may not follow the same accessibility policies no later than December 12, 2016.

            Subpart D—Accessibility of Airport Facilities
            
              § 382.51
              What requirements must carriers meet concerning the accessibility of airport facilities?
              (a) As a carrier, you must comply with the following requirements with respect to all terminal facilities you own, lease, or control at a U.S. airport:

              (1) You must ensure that terminal facilities providing access to air transportation are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs. You are deemed to comply with this obligation if the facilities meet requirements applying to places of public accommodation under Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations implementing Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

              (2) With respect to any situation in which boarding and deplaning by level-entry loading bridges or accessible passenger lounges to and from an aircraft is not available, you must ensure that there is an accessible route between the gate and the area from which aircraft are boarded (e.g., the tarmac in a situation in which level-entry boarding is not available). An accessible route is one meeting the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), sections 4.3.3 through 4.3.10.
              (3) You must ensure that systems of intra- and inter-terminal transportation, including, but not limited to, moving sidewalks, shuttle vehicles and people movers, comply with applicable requirements of the Department of Transportation's ADA rules (49 CFR parts 37 and 38).
              (4) Your contracts or leases with airport operators concerning the use of airport facilities must set forth your airport accessibility responsibility under this part and that of the airport operator under applicable section 504 and ADA rules of the Department of Transportation and Department of Justice.
              (5) In cooperation with the airport operator and in consultation with local service animal training organization(s), you must provide animal relief areas for service animals that accompany passengers departing, connecting, or arriving at an airport on your flights.
              (6) You must enable captioning at all times on all televisions and other audio-visual displays that are capable of displaying captions and that are located in any portion of the terminal to which any passengers have access on May 13, 2009. The captioning must be high-contrast insofar as is feasible.
              (7) You must replace any televisions and other audio-visual displays providing passengers with safety briefings, information, or entertainment that do not have high-contrast captioning capability with equipment that does have such capability whenever such equipment is replaced in the normal course of operations and/or whenever areas of the terminal in which such equipment is located are undergoing substantial renovation or expansion.
              (8) If you newly acquire televisions and other audio-visual displays for passenger safety briefings, information, or entertainment on or after May 13, 2009, such equipment must have high-contrast captioning capability.
              (b) As a carrier, you must ensure that passengers with a disability can readily use all terminal facilities you own, lease, or control at a foreign airport. In the case of foreign carriers, this requirement applies only to terminal facilities that serve flights covered by § 382.7 of this part.

              (1) This means that passengers with a disability must be able to move readily through such terminal facilities to get to or from the gate and any other area from which passengers board the aircraft you use for such flights (e.g., the tarmac in the case of flights that do not use level-entry boarding). This obligation is in addition to your obligation to provide enplaning, deplaning, and connecting assistance to passengers.
              (2) You may meet this obligation through any combination of facility accessibility, auxiliary aids, equipment, the assistance of personnel, or other appropriate means consistent with the safety and dignity of passengers with a disability.
              (c) As a foreign carrier, you must meet the requirements of this section by May 13, 2010, except as otherwise indicated in paragraph (a). As a U.S. carrier, you must meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section by May 13, 2010.
              [Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009; 75 FR 44887, July 30, 2010]
            
            
              § 382.53
              What information must carriers give individuals with a vision or hearing impairment at airports?

              (a)(1) As a U.S. carrier, you must ensure that passengers with a disability who identify themselves as persons needing visual or hearing assistance have prompt access to the same information provided to other passengers at each gate, ticketing area, and customer service desk that you own, lease, or control at any U.S. or foreign airport, to the extent that this does not interfere with employees' safety and security duties as set forth in FAA, TSA, and applicable foreign regulations.
              (2) As a foreign carrier, you must make this information available at each gate, ticketing area, and customer service desk that you own, lease, or control at any U.S. airport. At foreign airports, you must make this information available only at gates, ticketing areas, or customer service desks that you own, lease, or control and only for flights that begin or end in the U.S.
              (3) As a U.S. or foreign carrier, at any U.S. airport covered by this paragraph where the airport has effective control over the covered gates, ticketing areas, and customer service desks, you and the airport are jointly responsible for compliance.

              (b) The information you must provide under paragraph (a) of this section includes, but is not limited to, the following: Information concerning flight safety, ticketing, flight check-in, flight delays or cancellations, schedule changes, boarding information, connections, gate assignments, checking baggage, volunteer solicitation on oversold flights (e.g., offers of compensation for surrendering a reservation), individuals being paged by airlines, aircraft changes that affect the travel of persons with disabilities, and emergencies (e.g., fire, bomb threat).
              (c) With respect to information on claiming baggage, you must provide the information to passengers who identify themselves as persons needing visual or hearing assistance no later than you provide this information to other passengers.

              § 382.55
              May carriers impose security screening procedures for passengers with disabilities that go beyond TSA requirements or those of foreign governments?
              (a) All passengers, including those with disabilities, are subject to TSA security screening requirements at U.S. airports. In addition, passengers at foreign airports, including those with disabilities, may be subject to security screening measures required by law of the country in which the airport is located.
              (b) If, as a carrier, you impose security screening procedures for passengers with disabilities that go beyond those mandated by TSA (or, at a foreign airport, beyond the law of the country in which the airport is located), you must ensure that they meet the following requirements:
              (1) You must use the same criteria for applying security screening procedures to passengers with disabilities as to other passengers.
              (2) You must not subject a passenger with a disability to special screening procedures because the person is traveling with a mobility aid or other assistive device if the person using the aid or device clears the security system without activating it.
              (i) However, your security personnel may examine a mobility aid or assistive device which, in their judgment, may conceal a weapon or other prohibited item.
              (ii) You may conduct security searches of qualified individuals with a disability whose aids activate the security system in the same manner as for other passengers.
              (3) You must not require private security screenings of passengers with a disability to a greater extent, or for any different reason, than for other passengers.
              (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if a passenger with a disability requests a private screening in a timely manner, you must provide it in time for the passenger to enplane.

              (d) If you use technology that can conduct an appropriate screening of a passenger with a disability without necessitating a physical search of the person, you are not required to provide a private screening.

              § 382.57
              What accessibility requirements apply to automated airport kiosks?
              (a) As a carrier, you must comply with the following requirements with respect to any automated airport kiosk you own, lease, or control at a U.S. airport with 10,000 or more enplanements per year.
              (1) You must ensure that all automated airport kiosks installed on or after December 12, 2016, are models that meet the design specifications set forth in paragraph (c) of this section until at least 25 percent of automated kiosks provided in each location at the airport (i.e., each cluster of kiosks and all stand-alone kiosks at the airport) meets this specification.
              (2) You must ensure that at least 25 percent of automated kiosks you own, lease, or control in each location at a U.S. airport meet the design specifications in paragraph (c) of this section by December 12, 2022.
              (3) When the kiosks provided in a location at the airport perform more than one function (e.g., print boarding passes/bag tags, accept payment for flight amenities such as seating upgrades/meals/WiFi access, rebook tickets, etc.), you must ensure that the accessible kiosks provide all the same functions as the inaccessible kiosks in that location.
              (4) You must ensure that a passenger with a disability who requests an accessible automated kiosk is given priority access to any available accessible kiosk you own, lease, or control in that location at the airport.
              (5) You must ensure that each automated airport kiosk that meets the design specifications in paragraph (c) of this section is:
              (i) Visually and tactilely identifiable to users as accessible (e.g., an international symbol of accessibility affixed to the front of the device).
              (ii) Maintained in proper working condition.
              (b) As a carrier, you must comply with the following requirements for any shared-use automated airport kiosks you jointly own, lease, or control at a U.S. airport with 10,000 or more enplanements per year.
              (1) You must ensure that all shared-use automated airport kiosks you jointly own, lease, or control installed on or after December 12, 2016, meet the design specifications in paragraph (c) of this section until at least 25 percent of automated kiosks provided in each location at the airport (i.e., each cluster of kiosks and all stand-alone kiosks at an airport) meet this specification.
              (2) You must ensure that at least 25 percent of shared-use automated kiosks you own, lease, or control in each location at the airport meet the design specifications in paragraph (c) of this section by December 12, 2022.
              (3) When shared-use automated kiosks provided in a location at the airport perform more than one function (e.g., print boarding passes/bag tags, accept payment for flight amenities such as seating upgrades/meals/WiFi access, rebook tickets, etc.), you must ensure that the accessible kiosks provide all the same functions as the inaccessible kiosks in that location.
              (4) You must ensure that each automated airport kiosk that meets the design specifications set forth in paragraph (c) of this section is:
              (i) Visually and tactilely identifiable to users as accessible (e.g., an international symbol of accessibility affixed to the front of the device; and
              (ii) Maintained in proper working condition.
              (5) As a carrier, you are jointly and severally liable with airport operators and/or other participating carriers for ensuring that shared-use automated airport kiosks are compliant with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
              (c) You must ensure that the automated airport kiosks provided in accordance with this section conform to the following technical accessibility standards with respect to their physical design and the functions they perform:

Speech output must be recorded or digitized human, or synthesized. Speech output must be coordinated with information displayed on the screen. Speech output must comply with paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A) through (F) of this section.
              (A) When asterisks or other masking characters are used to represent personal identification numbers or other visual output that is not displayed for security purposes, the masking characters must be spoken (“*” spoken as “asterisk”) rather than presented as beep tones or speech representing the concealed information.
              (B) Advertisements and other similar information are not required to be audible unless they convey information that can be used in the transaction being conducted.
              (C) Speech for any single function must be automatically interrupted when a transaction is selected or navigation controls are used. Speech must be capable of being repeated and paused by the user.
              (D) Where receipts, tickets, or other outputs are provided as a result of a transaction, speech output must include all information necessary to complete or verify the transaction, except that—
              (1) Automated airport kiosk location, date and time of transaction, customer account numbers, and the kiosk identifier are not required to be audible;
              (2) Information that duplicates information available on-screen and already presented audibly is not required to be repeated; and
              (3) Printed copies of a carrier's contract of carriage, applicable fare rules, itineraries and other similar supplemental information that may be included with a boarding pass are not required to be audible.

              (B) Speaker volume. Where sound is delivered through speakers on the automated kiosk, incremental volume control must be provided with output amplification up to a level of at least 65 dB SPL. Where the ambient noise level of the environment is above 45 dB SPL, a volume gain of at least 20 dB above the ambient level must be user selectable. A function must be provided to automatically reset the volume to the default level after every use.
              (iii) Captioning. Multimedia content that contains speech or other audio information necessary for the comprehension of the content must be open or closed captioned. Advertisements and other similar information are not required to be captioned unless they convey information that can be used in the transaction being conducted.
              (iv) Tickets and boarding passes. Where tickets or boarding passes are provided, tickets and boarding passes must have an orientation that is tactilely discernible if orientation is important to further use of the ticket or boarding pass.
              (6) Input. Input devices must comply with paragraphs (c)(6)(i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) Input controls. At least one input control that is tactilely discernible without activation must be provided for each function.

            Subpart E—Accessibility of Aircraft
            
              § 382.61
              What are the requirements for movable aisle armrests?
              (a) As a carrier, you must ensure that aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats on which passenger aisle seats have armrests are equipped with movable aisle armrests on at least one-half of the aisle seats in rows in which passengers with mobility impairments are permitted to sit under FAA or applicable foreign government safety rules.
              (b) You are not required to provide movable armrests on aisle seats of rows which a passenger with a mobility impairment is precluded from using by an FAA safety rule.
              (c) You must ensure that these movable aisle armrests are provided proportionately in all classes of service in the cabin. For example, if 80 percent of the aisle seats in which passengers with mobility impairments may sit are in coach, and 20 percent are in first class, then 80 percent of the movable aisle armrests must be in coach, with 20 percent in first class.
              (d) For aircraft equipped with movable aisle armrests, you must configure cabins, or establish administrative systems, to ensure that passengers with mobility impairments or other passengers with a disability can readily identify and obtain seating in rows with movable aisle armrests. You must provide this information by specific seat and row number.
              (e) You are not required to retrofit cabin interiors of existing aircraft to comply with the requirements of this section. However, if you replace any of an aircraft's aisle seats with newly manufactured seats, the new seats must include movable aisle armrests as required by this section. However, an aircraft is never required to have movable aisle armrests on more than one half of the aisle seats.
              (f) As a foreign carrier, you must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after May 13, 2009 or which are delivered after May 13, 2010. As a U.S. carrier, the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e) of this section applies to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after April 5, 1990, or which are delivered after April 5, 1992. As a U.S. carrier, paragraph (c) of this section applies to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after May 13, 2009 or which were delivered after May 13, 2010.
              (g) As a foreign carrier, you must comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section with respect to seats ordered after May 13, 2009.
            
            
              § 382.63
              What are the requirements for accessible lavatories?
              (a) As a carrier, you must ensure that aircraft with more than one aisle in which lavatories are provided shall include at least one accessible lavatory.
              (1) The accessible lavatory must permit a qualified individual with a disability to enter, maneuver within as necessary to use all lavatory facilities, and leave, by means of the aircraft's on-board wheelchair.
              (2) The accessible lavatory must afford privacy to persons using the on-board wheelchair equivalent to that afforded ambulatory users.
              (3) The lavatory shall provide door locks, accessible call buttons, grab bars, faucets and other controls, and dispensers usable by qualified individuals with a disability, including wheelchair users and persons with manual impairments.
              (b) With respect to aircraft with only one aisle in which lavatories are provided, you may, but are not required to, provide an accessible lavatory.
              (c) You are not required to retrofit cabin interiors of existing aircraft to comply with the requirements of this section. However, if you replace a lavatory on an aircraft with more than one aisle, you must replace it with an accessible lavatory.

              (d) As a foreign carrier, you must comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after May 13, 2009 or which are delivered after May 13, 2010. As a U.S. carrier, this requirement applies to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after April 5, 1990, or which were delivered after April 5, 1992.
              
              (e) As a foreign carrier, you must comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning May 13, 2009. As a U.S. carrier, these requirements apply to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after April 5, 1990, or which were delivered after April 5, 1992.
            
            
              § 382.65
              What are the requirements concerning on-board wheelchairs?
              (a) As a carrier, you must equip aircraft that have more than 60 passenger seats, and that have an accessible lavatory (whether or not having such a lavatory is required by § 382.63 of this Part) with an on-board wheelchair. The Aerospatiale/Aeritalia ATR-72 and the British Aerospace Advanced Turboprop (ATP), in configurations having between 60 and 70 passenger seats, are exempt from this requirement.
              (b) If a passenger asks you to provide an on-board wheelchair on a particular flight, you must provide it if the aircraft being used for the flight has more than 60 passenger seats, even if the aircraft does not have an accessible lavatory.
              (1) The basis of the passenger's request must be that he or she can use an inaccessible lavatory but cannot reach it from a seat without using an on-board wheelchair.
              (2) You may require the passenger to provide the advance notice specified in § 382.27 to receive this service.
              (c) You must ensure that on-board wheelchairs meet the following standards:
              (1) On-board wheelchairs must include footrests, armrests which are movable or removable, adequate occupant restraint systems, a backrest height that permits assistance to passengers in transferring, structurally sound handles for maneuvering the occupied chair, and wheel locks or another adequate means to prevent chair movement during transfer or turbulence.
              (2) The chair must be designed to be compatible with the maneuvering space, aisle width, and seat height of the aircraft on which it is to be used, and to be easily pushed, pulled, and turned in the cabin environment by carrier personnel.
              (d) As a foreign carrier, you must meet this requirement as of May 13, 2010. As a U.S. carrier, you must meet this requirement by May 13, 2009.
            
            
              § 382.67
              What is the requirement for priority space in the cabin to store passengers' wheelchairs?
              (a) As a carrier, you must ensure that there is priority space (i.e., a closet, or a row of seats where a wheelchair may be strapped using a strap kit that complies with applicable Federal Aviation Administration or applicable foreign government regulations on the stowage of cargo in the cabin compartment) in the cabin of sufficient size to stow at least one typical adult-sized folding, collapsible, or break-down manual passenger wheelchair, the dimensions of which are 13 inches by 36 inches by 42 inches or less without having to remove the wheels or otherwise disassemble it. This section applies to any aircraft with 100 or more passenger seats and this space must be other than the overhead compartments and under-seat spaces routinely used for passengers' carry-on items.
              (b) If you are a carrier that uses the seat-strapping method to stow a manual passenger wheelchair, you must ensure that there is priority space for at least two such wheelchairs, if stowing the second passenger wheelchair would not displace passengers.
              (c) If you are a carrier that uses a closet as the priority space to stow a manual passenger wheelchair, you must install a sign or placard prominently on the closet indicating that such wheelchairs and other assistive devices are to be stowed in this area with priority over other items brought onto the aircraft by other passengers or crew, including crew luggage, as set forth in § 382.123.
              (d) If passengers holding confirmed reservations are not able to travel on a flight because their seats are being used to stow a passenger's wheelchair as required by paragraph (a) of this section, carriers must compensate those passengers in an amount to be calculated as provided for in instances of involuntary denied boarding under 14 CFR part 250, where part 250 applies.

              (e) As a carrier, you must never request or suggest that a passenger not stow his or her wheelchair in the cabin to accommodate other passengers (e.g., informing a passenger that stowing his or her wheelchair in the cabin will require other passengers to be removed from the flight), or for any other non-safety related reason (e.g., that it is easier for the carrier if the wheelchair is stowed in the cargo compartment).
              (f) As a carrier, you must offer pre-boarding to a passenger stowing his or her wheelchair in the cabin.
              (g) As a foreign carrier, you must meet the requirement of this section for new aircraft ordered after May 13, 2009, or delivered after May 13, 2010. As a U.S. carrier, this section applies to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were ordered after April 5, 1990, or which were delivered after April 5, 1992.

              § 382.69
              What requirements must carriers meet concerning the accessibility of videos, DVDs, and other audio-visual presentations shown on-aircraft to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing?
              (a) As a carrier, you must ensure that all new videos, DVDs, and other audio-visual displays played on aircraft for safety purposes, and all such new audio-visual displays played on aircraft for informational purposes that were created under your control, are high-contrast captioned. The captioning must be in the predominant language or languages in which you communicate with passengers on the flight.
              (b) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section go into effect with respect to audio-visual displays used for safety purposes on November 10, 2009.
              (c) Between May 13, 2009 and November 9, 2009, U.S. carriers must ensure that all videos, DVDs, and other audio-visual displays played on aircraft for safety purposes have open captioning or an inset for a sign language interpreter, unless such captioning or inset either would interfere with the video presentation so as to render it ineffective or would not be large enough to be readable, in which case these carriers must use an equivalent non-video alternative for transmitting the briefing to passengers with hearing impairments.
              (d) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section go into effect with respect to informational displays on January 8, 2010.
            
            
              § 382.71
              What other aircraft accessibility requirements apply to carriers?
              (a) As a carrier, you must maintain all aircraft accessibility features in proper working order.
              (b) You must ensure that any replacement or refurbishing of the aircraft cabin or its elements does not reduce the accessibility of that element to a level below that specified for new aircraft in this part.

            Subpart F—Seating Accommodations
            
              § 382.81
              For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?
              As a carrier, you must provide the following seating accommodations to the following passengers on request, if the passenger self-identifies to you as having a disability specified in this section and the type of seating accommodation in question exists on the particular aircraft. Once the passenger self-identifies to you, you must ensure that the information is recorded and properly transmitted to personnel responsible for providing the accommodation.
              (a) For a passenger who uses an aisle chair to access the aircraft and who cannot readily transfer over a fixed aisle armrest, you must provide a seat in a row with a movable aisle armrest. You must ensure that your personnel are trained in the location and proper use of movable aisle armrests, including appropriate transfer techniques. You must ensure that aisle seats with movable armrests are clearly identifiable.
              (b) You must provide an adjoining seat for a person assisting a passenger with a disability in the following circumstances:

              (1) When a passenger with a disability is traveling with a personal care attendant who will be performing a function for the individual during the flight that airline personnel are not required to perform (e.g., assistance with eating);
              (2) When a passenger with a vision impairment is traveling with a reader/assistant who will be performing functions for the individual during the flight;
              (3) When a passenger with a hearing impairment is traveling with an interpreter who will be performing functions for the individual during the flight; or
              (4) When you require a passenger to travel with a safety assistant (see § 382.29).
              (c) For a passenger with a disability traveling with a service animal, you must provide, as the passenger requests, either a bulkhead seat or a seat other than a bulkhead seat.
              (d) For a passenger with a fused or immobilized leg, you must provide a bulkhead seat or other seat that provides greater legroom than other seats, on the side of an aisle that better accommodates the individual's disability.
            
            
              § 382.83
              Through what mechanisms do carriers make seating accommodations?

              (a) If you are a carrier that provides advance seat assignments to passengers (i.e., offer seat assignments to passengers before the day of the flight), you must comply with the requirements of § 382.81 of this part by any of the following methods:
              (1) You may “block” an adequate number of the seats used to provide the seating accommodations required by § 382.81.
              (i) You must not assign these seats to passengers who do not meet the criteria of § 382.81 until 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the flight.
              (ii) At any time up until 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the flight, you must assign a seat meeting the requirements of this section to a passenger with a disability meeting one or more of the requirements of § 382.81 who requests it, at the time the passenger initially makes the request.
              (iii) If a passenger with a disability specified in § 382.81 does not make a request at least 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the flight, you must meet the passenger's request to the extent practicable, but you are not required to reassign a seat assigned to another passenger in order to do so.
              (2) You may designate an adequate number of the seats used to provide seating accommodations required by § 382.81 as “priority seats” for passengers with a disability.
              (i) You must provide notice that all passengers assigned these seats (other than passengers with a disability listed in § 382.81 of this part) are subject to being reassigned to another seat if necessary to provide a seating accommodation required by this section.
              (ii) You may provide this notice through your computer reservation system, verbal information provided by reservation personnel, ticket notices, gate announcements, counter signs, seat cards or notices, frequent-flier literature, or other appropriate means.
              (iii) You must assign a seat meeting the requirements of this section to a passenger with a disability listed in § 382.81 of this part who requests the accommodation at the time the passenger makes the request. You may require such a passenger to check in and request the seating accommodation at least one hour before the standard check-in time for the flight. If all designated priority seats that would accommodate the passenger have been assigned to other passengers, you must reassign the seats of the other passengers as needed to provide the requested accommodation.
              (iv) If a passenger with a disability listed in § 382.81 does not check in at least an hour before the standard check-in time for the general public, you must meet the individual's request to the extent practicable, but you are not required to reassign a seat assigned to another passenger in order to do so.
              (b) If you assign seats to passengers, but not until the date of the flight, you must use the “priority seating” approach of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

              (c) If you do not provide advance seat assignments to passengers, you must allow passengers specified in § 382.81 to board the aircraft before other passengers, including other “preboarded” passengers, so that the passengers needing seating accommodations can select seats that best meet their needs.
              (d) As a carrier, if you wish to use a different method of providing seating assignment accommodations to passengers with disabilities from those specified in this subpart, you must obtain the written concurrence of the Department of Transportation. Contact the Department at the address cited in § 382.159 of this part.
            
            
              § 382.85
              What seating accommodations must carriers make to passengers in circumstances not covered by § 382.81 (a) through (d)?
              As a carrier, you must provide the following seating accommodations to a passenger who self-identifies as having a disability other than one in the four categories listed in § 382.81 (a) through (d) of this part and as needing a seat assignment accommodation in order to readily access and use the carrier's air transportation services:
              (a) As a carrier that assigns seats in advance, you must provide accommodations in the following ways:
              (1) If you use the “seat-blocking” mechanism of § 382.83(a)(1) of this part, you must implement the requirements of this section as follows:
              (i) When a passenger with a disability not described in § 382.81(a) through (d) of this part makes a reservation more than 24 hours before the scheduled departure time of the flight, you are not required to offer the passenger one of the seats blocked for the use of passengers with a disability listed under § 382.81.
              (ii) However, you must assign to the passenger any seat, not already assigned to another passenger that accommodates the passenger's needs, even if that seat is not available for assignment to the general passenger population at the time of the request.
              (2) If you use the “designated priority seats” mechanism of § 382.83(a)(2) of this part, you must implement the requirements of this section as follows:
              (i) When a passenger with a disability not described in § 382.81 makes a reservation, you must assign to the passenger any seat, not already assigned to another passenger, that accommodates the passenger's needs, even if that seat is not available for assignment to the general passenger population at the time of the request. You may require a passenger making such a request to check in one hour before the standard check-in time for the flight.
              (ii) If such a passenger is assigned to a designated priority seat, he or she is subject to being reassigned to another seat as provided in § 382.83(a)(2)(i) of this subpart.
              (b) On flights where advance seat assignments are not offered, you must provide seating accommodations under this section by allowing passengers to board the aircraft before other passengers, including other “preboarded” passengers, so that the individuals needing seating accommodations can select seats that best meet their needs.
              (c) If you assign seats to passengers, but not until the date of the flight, you must use the “priority seating” approach of section 382.83(a)(2).
            
            
              § 382.87
              What other requirements pertain to seating for passengers with a disability?
              (a) As a carrier, you must not exclude any passenger with a disability from any seat or require that a passenger with a disability sit in any particular seat, on the basis of disability, except to comply with FAA or applicable foreign government safety requirements.
              (b) In responding to requests from individuals for accommodations under this subpart, you must comply with FAA and applicable foreign government safety requirements, including those pertaining to exit seating (see 14 CFR 121.585 and 135.129).
              (c) If a passenger's disability results in involuntary active behavior that would result in the person properly being refused transportation under § 382.19, and the passenger could be transported safely if seated in another location, you must offer to let the passenger sit in that location as an alternative to being refused transportation.

              (d) If you have already provided a seat to a passenger with a disability to furnish an accommodation required by this subpart, you must not (except in the circumstance described in § 382.85(a)(2)(ii)) reassign that passenger to another seat in response to a subsequent request from another passenger with a disability, without the first passenger's consent.
              (e) You must never deny transportation to any passenger in order to provide accommodations required by this subpart.
              (f) You are not required to furnish more than one seat per ticket or to provide a seat in a class of service other than the one the passenger has purchased in order to provide an accommodation required by this part.
            
          
          
            Subpart G—Boarding, Deplaning, and Connecting Assistance
            
              § 382.91
              What assistance must carriers provide to passengers with a disability in moving within the terminal?

              (a) As a carrier, you must provide or ensure the provision of assistance requested by or on behalf of a passenger with a disability, or offered by carrier or airport operator personnel and accepted by a passenger with a disability, in transportation between gates to make a connection to another flight. If the arriving flight and the departing connecting flight are operated by different carriers, the carrier that operated the arriving flight (i.e., the one that operates the first of the two flights that are connecting) is responsible for providing or ensuring the provision of this assistance, even if the passenger holds a separate ticket for the departing flight. It is permissible for the two carriers to mutually agree that the carrier operating the departing connecting flight (i.e., the second flight of the two) will provide this assistance, but the carrier operating the arriving flight remains responsible under this section for ensuring that the assistance is provided.
              (b) You must also provide or ensure the provision of assistance requested by or on behalf of a passenger with a disability, or offered by carrier or airport operator personnel and accepted by a passenger with a disability, in moving from the terminal entrance (or a vehicle drop-off point adjacent to the entrance) through the airport to the gate for a departing flight, or from the gate to the terminal entrance (or a vehicle pick-up point adjacent to the entrance after an arriving flight).
              (1) This requirement includes assistance in accessing key functional areas of the terminal, such as ticket counters and baggage claim.
              (2) This requirement also includes a brief stop upon the passenger's request at the entrance to a rest room (including an accessible rest room when requested). As a carrier, you are required to make such a stop only if the rest room is available on the route to the destination of the enplaning, deplaning, or connecting assistance and you can make the stop without unreasonable delay. To receive such assistance, the passenger must self-identify as being an individual with a disability needing the assistance.
              (c) As a carrier at a U.S. airport, you must, on request, in cooperation with the airport operator, provide for escorting a passenger with a service animal to an animal relief area provided under § 382.51(a)(5) of this part.

              (d) As part of your obligation to provide or ensure the provision of assistance to passengers with disabilities in moving through the terminal (e.g., between the terminal entrance and the gate, between gate and aircraft, from gate to a baggage claim area), you must assist passengers who are unable to carry their luggage because of a disability with transporting their gate-checked or carry-on luggage. You may request the credible verbal assurance that a passenger cannot carry the luggage in question. If a passenger is unable to provide credible assurance, you may require the passenger to provide documentation as a condition of providing this service.
            
            
              § 382.93
              Must carriers offer preboarding to passengers with a disability?
              As a carrier, you must offer preboarding to passengers with a disability who self-identify at the gate as needing additional time or assistance to board, stow accessibility equipment, or be seated.
            
            
              § 382.95
              What are carriers' general obligations with respect to boarding and deplaning assistance?

              (a) As a carrier, you must promptly provide or ensure the provision of assistance requested by or on behalf of passengers with a disability, or offered by carrier or airport operator personnel and accepted by passengers with a disability, in enplaning and deplaning. This assistance must include, as needed, the services of personnel and the use of ground wheelchairs, accessible motorized carts, boarding wheelchairs, and/or on-board wheelchairs where provided in accordance with this part, and ramps or mechanical lifts.
              (b) As a carrier, you must, except as otherwise provided in this subpart, provide boarding and deplaning assistance through the use of lifts or ramps at any U.S. commercial service airport with 10,000 or more annual enplanements where boarding and deplaning by level-entry loading bridges or accessible passenger lounges is not available.
            
            
              § 382.97
              To which aircraft does the requirement to provide boarding and deplaning assistance through the use of lifts apply?
              The requirement of section 382.95(b) of this part to provide boarding and deplaning assistance through the use of lifts applies with respect to all aircraft with a passenger capacity of 19 or more, with the following exceptions:
              (a) Float planes;
              (b) The following 19-seat capacity aircraft models: the Fairchild Metro, the Jetstream 31 and 32, the Beech 1900 (C and D models), and the Embraer EMB-120;
              (c) Any other aircraft model determined by the Department of Transportation to be unsuitable for boarding and deplaning assistance by lift, ramp, or other suitable device.
              The Department will make such a determination if it concludes that—
              (1) No existing boarding and deplaning assistance device on the market will accommodate the aircraft without a significant risk of serious damage to the aircraft or injury to passengers or employees, or
              (2) Internal barriers are present in the aircraft that would preclude passengers who use a boarding or aisle chair from reaching a non-exit row seat.
            
            
              § 382.99
              What agreements must carriers have with the airports they serve?
              (a) As a carrier, you must negotiate in good faith with the airport operator of each U.S. airport described in § 382.95(b) to ensure the provision of lifts for boarding and deplaning where level-entry loading bridges are not available.
              (b) You must have a written, signed agreement with the airport operator allocating responsibility for meeting the boarding and deplaning assistance requirements of this subpart between or among the parties. For foreign carriers, with respect to all covered aircraft, this requirement becomes effective May 13, 2010.
              (c) For foreign carriers, the agreement with a U.S. airport must provide that all actions necessary to ensure accessible boarding and deplaning for passengers with a disability are completed as soon as practicable, but no later than May 13, 2011.
              (d) Under the agreement, you may, as a carrier, require that passengers wishing to receive boarding and deplaning assistance requiring the use of a lift for a flight check in for the flight one hour before the standard check-in time for the flight. If the passenger checks in after this time, you must nonetheless provide the boarding and deplaning assistance by lift if you can do so by making a reasonable effort, without delaying the flight.
              (e) The agreement must ensure that all lifts and other accessibility equipment are maintained in proper working condition.
              (f) All carriers and airport operators involved are jointly and severally responsible for the timely and complete implementation of the agreement.
              (g) You must make a copy of this agreement available, on request, to representatives of the Department of Transportation.

              § 382.101
              What other boarding and deplaning assistance must carriers provide?

              When level-entry boarding and deplaning assistance is not required to be provided under this subpart, you must, as a carrier, provide or ensure the provision of boarding and deplaning assistance by any available means to which the passenger consents. However, you must never use hand-carrying (i.e., directly picking up the passenger's body in the arms of one or more carrier personnel to effect a level change the passenger needs to enter or leave the aircraft), even if the passenger consents, unless this is the only way of evacuating the individual in the event of an emergency. The situations in which level-entry boarding is not required but in which you must provide this boarding and deplaning assistance include, but are not limited to, the following:
              (a) The boarding or deplaning process occurs at a U.S. airport that is not a commercial service airport that has 10,000 or more enplanements per year;
              (b) The boarding or deplaning process occurs at a foreign airport;
              (c) You are using an aircraft subject to an exception from the lift boarding and deplaning assistance requirements under § 382.97 (a)-(c) of this subpart;
              (d) The deadlines established in § 382.99(c) have not yet passed; and
              (e) Circumstances beyond your control (e.g., unusually severe weather; unexpected mechanical problems) prevent the use of a lift.
            
            
              § 382.103
              May a carrier leave a passenger unattended in a wheelchair or other device?

              As a carrier, you must not leave a passenger who has requested assistance required by this subpart unattended by the personnel responsible for enplaning, deplaning, or connecting assistance in a ground wheelchair, boarding wheelchair, or other device, in which the passenger is not independently mobile, for more than 30 minutes. This requirement applies even if another person (e.g., family member, personal care attendant) is accompanying the passenger, unless the passenger explicitly waives the obligation.
            
            
              § 382.105
              What is the responsibility of carriers at foreign airports at which airport operators have responsibility for enplaning, deplaning, and connecting assistance?
              At a foreign airport at which enplaning, deplaning, or connecting assistance is provided by the airport operator, rather than by carriers, as a carrier you may rely on the services provided by the airport operator to meet the requirements of this subpart. If the services provided by the airport operator are not sufficient to meet the requirements of this subpart, you must supplement the airport operator's services to ensure that these requirements are met. If you believe you are precluded by law from supplementing the airport operator's services, you may apply for a conflict of laws waiver under § 382.9 of this part.
            
          
          
            Subpart H—Services on Aircraft
            
              § 382.111
              What services must carriers provide to passengers with a disability on board the aircraft?
              As a carrier, you must provide services within the aircraft cabin as requested by or on behalf of passengers with a disability, or when offered by carrier personnel and accepted by passengers with a disability, as follows:
              (a) Assistance in moving to and from seats, as part of the enplaning and deplaning processes;
              (b) Assistance in preparation for eating, such as opening packages and identifying food;
              (c) If there is an on-board wheelchair on the aircraft, assistance with the use of the on-board wheelchair to enable the person to move to and from a lavatory;
              (d) Assistance to a semi-ambulatory person in moving to and from the lavatory, not involving lifting or carrying the person; or

              (e) Assistance in stowing and retrieving carry-on items, including mobility aids and other assistive devices stowed in the cabin (see also 382.91(d)). To receive such assistance, the passenger must self-identify as being an individual with a disability needing the assistance.
              

              (f) Effective communication with passengers who have vision impairments or who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, so that these passengers have prompt access to information the carrier provides to other passengers (e.g. weather, on-board services, flight delays, connecting gates at the next airport).

              § 382.113
              What services are carriers not required to provide to passengers with a disability on board the aircraft?
              As a carrier, you are not required to provide extensive special assistance to qualified individuals with a disability. For purposes of this section, extensive special assistance includes the following activities:
              (a) Assistance in actual eating;
              (b) Assistance within the restroom or assistance at the passenger's seat with elimination functions; and
              (c) Provision of medical services.
            
            
              § 382.115
              What requirements apply to on-board safety briefings?
              As a carrier, you must comply with the following requirements with respect to on-board safety briefings:
              (a) You must conduct an individual safety briefing for any passenger where required by 14 CFR 121.571(a)(3) and (a)(4), 14 CFR 135.117(b), or other FAA requirements.
              (b) You may offer an individual briefing to any other passenger, but you may not require an individual to have such a briefing except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) You must not require any passenger with a disability to demonstrate that he or she has listened to, read, or understood the information presented, except to the extent that carrier personnel impose such a requirement on all passengers with respect to the general safety briefing. You must not take any action adverse to a qualified individual with a disability on the basis that the person has not “accepted” the briefing.
              (d) When you conduct an individual safety briefing for a passenger with a disability, you must do so as inconspicuously and discreetly as possible.
              (e) The accessibility requirements for onboard video safety presentations that carriers must meet are outlined in section 382.69.
            
            
              § 382.117
              Must carriers permit passengers with a disability to travel with service animals?
              (a) As a carrier, you must permit a service animal to accompany a passenger with a disability.
              (1) You must not deny transportation to a service animal on the basis that its carriage may offend or annoy carrier personnel or persons traveling on the aircraft.
              (2) On a flight segment scheduled to take 8 hours or more, you may, as a condition of permitting a service animal to travel in the cabin, require the passenger using the service animal to provide documentation that the animal will not need to relieve itself on the flight or that the animal can relieve itself in a way that does not create a health or sanitation issue on the flight.
              (b) You must permit the service animal to accompany the passenger with a disability at any seat in which the passenger sits, unless the animal obstructs an aisle or other area that must remain unobstructed to facilitate an emergency evacuation.
              (c) If a service animal cannot be accommodated at the seat location of the passenger with a disability who is using the animal, you must offer the passenger the opportunity to move with the animal to another seat location, if present on the aircraft, where the animal can be accommodated.
              (d) As evidence that an animal is a service animal, you must accept identification cards, other written documentation, presence of harnesses, tags, or the credible verbal assurances of a qualified individual with a disability using the animal.

              (e) If a passenger seeks to travel with an animal that is used as an emotional support or psychiatric service animal, you are not required to accept the animal for transportation in the cabin unless the passenger provides you current documentation (i.e., no older than one year from the date of the passenger's scheduled initial flight) on the letterhead of a licensed mental health professional (e.g., psychiatrist, psychologist, licensed clinical social worker, including a medical doctor specifically treating the passenger's mental or emotional disability) stating the following:
              (1) The passenger has a mental or emotional disability recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition (DSM IV);
              (2) The passenger needs the emotional support or psychiatric service animal as an accommodation for air travel and/or for activity at the passenger's destination;
              (3) The individual providing the assessment is a licensed mental health professional, and the passenger is under his or her professional care; and
              (4) The date and type of the mental health professional's license and the state or other jurisdiction in which it was issued.

              (f) You are never required to accommodate certain unusual service animals (e.g., snakes, other reptiles, ferrets, rodents, and spiders) as service animals in the cabin. With respect to all other animals, including unusual or exotic animals that are presented as service animals (e.g., miniature horses, pigs, monkeys), as a carrier you must determine whether any factors preclude their traveling in the cabin as service animals (e.g., whether the animal is too large or heavy to be accommodated in the cabin, whether the animal would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others, whether it would cause a significant disruption of cabin service, whether it would be prohibited from entering a foreign country that is the flight's destination). If no such factors preclude the animal from traveling in the cabin, you must permit it to do so. However, as a foreign carrier, you are not required to carry service animals other than dogs.
              (g) Whenever you decide not to accept an animal as a service animal, you must explain the reason for your decision to the passenger and document it in writing. A copy of the explanation must be provided to the passenger either at the airport, or within 10 calendar days of the incident.

              (h) You must promptly take all steps necessary to comply with foreign regulations (e.g., animal health regulations) needed to permit the legal transportation of a passenger's service animal from the U.S. into a foreign airport.
              (i) Guidance concerning the carriage of service animals generally is found in the preamble of this rule. Guidance on the steps necessary to legally transport service animals on flights from the U.S. into the United Kingdom is found in 72 FR 8268-8277, (February 26, 2007).

              § 382.119
              What information must carriers give individuals with vision or hearing impairment on aircraft?
              (a) As a carrier, you must ensure that passengers with a disability who identify themselves as needing visual or hearing assistance have prompt access to the same information provided to other passengers on the aircraft as described in paragraph (b) of this section, to the extent that it does not interfere with crewmembers' safety duties as set forth in FAA and applicable foreign regulations.

              (b) The covered information includes but is not limited to the following: information concerning flight safety, procedures for takeoff and landing, flight delays, schedule or aircraft changes that affect the travel of persons with disabilities, diversion to a different airport, scheduled departure and arrival time, boarding information, weather conditions at the flight's destination, beverage and menu information, connecting gate assignments, baggage claim, individuals being paged by airlines, and emergencies (e.g., fire or bomb threat).
            
          
          
            Subpart I—Stowage of Wheelchairs, Other Mobility Aids, and Other Assistive Devices
            
              § 382.121
              What mobility aids and other assistive devices may passengers with a disability bring into the aircraft cabin?

              (a) As a carrier, you must permit passengers with a disability to bring the following kinds of items into the aircraft cabin, provided that they can be stowed in designated priority storage areas or in overhead compartments or under seats, consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of carry-on items.
              (1) Manual wheelchairs, including folding or collapsible wheelchairs;
              (2) Other mobility aids, such as canes (including those used by persons with impaired vision), crutches, and walkers; and

              (3) Other assistive devices for stowage or use within the cabin (e.g., prescription medications and any medical devices needed to administer them such as syringes or auto-injectors, vision-enhancing devices, and POCs, ventilators and respirators that use non-spillable batteries, as long as they comply with applicable safety, security and hazardous materials rules).
              (b) In implementing your carry-on baggage policies, you must not count assistive devices (including the kinds of items listed in paragraph (a) of this section) toward a limit on carry-on baggage.
            
            
              § 382.123
              What are the requirements concerning priority cabin stowage for wheelchairs and other assistive devices?
              (a) The following rules apply to the stowage of passengers' wheelchairs or other assistive devices in the priority stowage area provided for in § 382.67 of this part:

              (1) You must ensure that a passenger with a disability who uses a wheelchair and takes advantage of the opportunity to preboard the aircraft can stow his or her wheelchair in this area, with priority over other items brought onto the aircraft by other passengers or crew enplaning at the same airport, consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of carry-on items. You must move items that you or your personnel have placed in the priority stowage area (e.g., crew luggage, an on-board wheelchair) to make room for the passenger's wheelchair, even if these items were stowed in the priority stowage area before the passenger seeking to stow a wheelchair boarded the aircraft (e.g., the items were placed there on a previous leg of the flight).
              (2) You must also ensure that a passenger with a disability who takes advantage of the opportunity to preboard the aircraft can stow other assistive devices in this area, with priority over other items (except wheelchairs) brought onto the aircraft by other passengers enplaning at the same airport consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of carry-on items.
              (3) You must ensure that a passenger with a disability who does not take advantage of the opportunity to preboard is able to use the area to stow his or her wheelchair or other assistive device on a first-come, first-served basis along with all other passengers seeking to stow carry-on items in the area.
              (b) If a wheelchair exceeds the space provided for in § 382.67 of this part while fully assembled but will fit if wheels or other components can be removed without the use of tools, you must remove the applicable components and stow the wheelchair in the designated space. In this case, you must stow the removed components in areas provided for stowage of carry-on luggage.

              § 382.125
              What procedures do carriers follow when wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices must be stowed in the cargo compartment?

              (a) As a carrier, you must stow wheelchairs, other mobility aids, or other assistive devices in the baggage compartment if an approved stowage area is not available in the cabin or the items cannot be transported in the cabin consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of carry-on items.
              
              (b) You must give wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices priority for stowage in the baggage compartment over other cargo and baggage. Only items that fit into the baggage compartment and can be transported consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of items in the baggage compartment need be transported. Where this priority results in other passengers' baggage being unable to be carried on the flight, you must make your best efforts to ensure that the other baggage reaches the passengers' destination on the carrier's next flight to the destination.
              (c) You must provide for the checking and timely return of passengers' wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices as close as possible to the door of the aircraft, so that passengers may use their own equipment to the extent possible, except
              (1) Where this practice would be inconsistent with Federal regulations governing transportation security or the transportation of hazardous materials; or
              (2) When the passenger requests the return of the items at the baggage claim area instead of at the door of the aircraft.
              (d) In order to achieve the timely return of wheelchairs, you must ensure that passengers' wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices are among the first items retrieved from the baggage compartment.
            
            
              § 382.127
              What procedures apply to stowage of battery-powered mobility aids?
              (a) Whenever baggage compartment size and aircraft airworthiness considerations do not prohibit doing so, you must, as a carrier, accept a passenger's battery-powered wheelchair or other similar mobility device, including the battery, as checked baggage, consistent with the requirements of 49 CFR 175.10(a)(15) and (16) and the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
              (b) You may require that passengers with a disability wishing to have battery-powered wheelchairs or other similar mobility devices transported on a flight check in one hour before the check-in time for the general public. If the passenger checks in after this time, you must nonetheless carry the wheelchair or other similar mobility device if you can do so by making a reasonable effort, without delaying the flight.
              (c) If the battery on the passenger's wheelchair or other similar mobility device has been labeled by the manufacturer as non-spillable as provided in 49 CFR 173.159(d)(2), or if a battery-powered wheelchair with a spillable battery can be loaded, stored, secured and unloaded in an upright position, you must not require the battery to be removed and separately packaged. Notwithstanding this requirement, you must remove and package separately any battery that is inadequately secured to a wheelchair or, for a spillable battery, is contained in a wheelchair that cannot be loaded, stowed, secured and unloaded in an upright position, in accordance with 49 CFR 175.10(a)(15) and (16). A damaged or leaking battery should not be transported.
              (d) When it is necessary to detach the battery from the wheelchair, you must, upon request, provide packaging for the battery meeting the requirements of 49 CFR 175.10(a)(15) and (16) and package the battery. You may refuse to use packaging materials or devices other than those you normally use for this purpose.
              (e) You must not disconnect the battery on wheelchairs or other mobility devices equipped with a non-spillable battery completely enclosed within a case or compartment integral to the design of the device unless an FAA or PHMSA safety regulation, or an applicable foreign safety regulation having mandatory legal effect, requires you to do so.
              (f) You must not drain batteries.
            
            
              § 382.129
              What other requirements apply when passengers' wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices must be disassembled for stowage?

              (a) As a carrier, you must permit passengers with a disability to provide written directions concerning the disassembly and reassembly of their wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices. You must carry out these instructions to the greatest extent feasible, consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of carry-on items.
              (b) When wheelchairs, other mobility aids, or other assistive devices are disassembled by the carrier for stowage, you must reassemble them and ensure their prompt return to the passenger. You must return wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices to the passenger in the condition in which you received them.
            
            
              § 382.131
              Do baggage liability limits apply to mobility aids and other assistive devices?
              With respect to transportation to which 14 CFR part 254 applies, the limits to liability for loss, damage, or delay concerning wheelchairs or other assistive devices provided in part 254 do not apply. The basis for calculating the compensation for a lost, damaged, or destroyed wheelchair or other assistive device shall be the original purchase price of the device.
            
            
              § 382.133
              What are the requirements concerning the evaluation and use of passenger-supplied electronic devices that assist passengers with respiration in the cabin during flight?
              (a) Except for on-demand air taxi operators, as a U.S. carrier conducting passenger service you must permit any individual with a disability to use in the passenger cabin during air transportation an electronic assistive device specified in paragraph (c) of this section on all aircraft originally designed to have a maximum passenger capacity of more than 19 seats unless:
              (1) The device does not meet applicable FAA requirements for medical portable electronic device; or
              (2) The device cannot be stowed and used in the passenger cabin consistent with applicable TSA, FAA, and PHMSA regulations.
              (b) Except for foreign carriers conducting operations of a nature equivalent to on-demand air taxi operations by a U.S. carrier, as a foreign carrier conducting passenger service you must permit any individual with a disability to use in the passenger cabin during air transportation to, from or within the United States, an electronic assistive device specified in paragraph (d) of this section on all aircraft originally designed to have a maximum passenger capacity of more than 19 seats unless:
              (1) The device does not meet requirements for medical portable electronic devices set by the foreign carrier's government if such requirements exist;
              (2) The device does not meet requirements for medical portable electronic devices set by the FAA for U.S. carriers in circumstances where requirements for medical portable electronic devices have not been set by the foreign carrier's government and the foreign carrier elects to apply FAA requirements for medical portable electronic devices; or
              (3) The device cannot be stowed and used in the passenger cabin consistent with applicable TSA, FAA and PHMSA regulations, and the safety or security regulations of the foreign carrier's government.
              (c) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, as a covered U.S. air carrier, you must accept the passenger supplied electronic assistive device in this paragraph (c):
              (1) A portable oxygen concentrator (POC), a ventilator, a respirator or a continuous positive airway pressure machine that displays a manufacturer's label that indicates the device meets FAA requirements; and
              (2) The following POC models whether or not they are labeled:
              (i) AirSep Focus;
              (ii) AirSep FreeStyle;
              (iii) AirSep FreeStyle 5;

              § 382.151
              What are the requirements for providing Complaints Resolution Officials?
              (a) As a carrier providing service using aircraft with 19 or more passenger seats, you must designate one or more CROs.

              (b) As a U.S. carrier, you must make a CRO available at each airport you serve during all times you are operating at that airport. As a foreign carrier, you must make a CRO available at each airport serving flights you operate that begin or end at a U.S. airport. You may make the CRO available in person at the airport or via telephone, at no cost to the passenger. If a telephone link to the CRO is used, TTY service or a similarly effective technology must be available so that persons with hearing impairments may readily communicate with the CRO. You must make CRO service available in the language(s) in which you make your services available to the general public.
              
              (c) You must make passengers with a disability aware of the availability of a CRO and how to contact the CRO in the following circumstances:

              (1) In any situation in which any person complains or raises a concern with your personnel about discrimination, accommodations, or services with respect to passengers with a disability, and your personnel do not immediately resolve the issue to the customer's satisfaction or provide a requested accommodation, your personnel must immediately inform the passenger of the right to contact a CRO and then contact a CRO on the passenger's behalf or provide the passenger a means to do so (e.g., a phone, a phone card plus the location and/or phone number of the CRO available at the airport). Your personnel must provide this information to the passenger in a format he or she can use.
              (2) Your reservation agents, contractors, and Web sites must provide information equivalent to that required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section to passengers with a disability using those services who complain or raise a concern about a disability-related issue.
              (d) Each CRO must be thoroughly familiar with the requirements of this part and the carrier's procedures with respect to passengers with a disability. The CRO is intended to be the carrier's “expert” in compliance with the requirements of this part.
              (e) You must ensure that each of your CROs has the authority to make dispositive resolution of complaints on behalf of the carrier. This means that the CRO must have the power to overrule the decision of any other personnel, except that the CRO is not required to be given authority to countermand a decision of the pilot-in-command of an aircraft based on safety.
              [Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11472, Mar. 18, 2009; 75 FR 44887, July 30, 2010]
            
            
              § 382.153
              What actions do CROs take on complaints?
              When a complaint is made directly to a CRO for a carrier providing service using aircraft with 19 or more passenger seats, the CRO must promptly take dispositive action as follows:
              (a) If the complaint is made to a CRO before the action or proposed action of carrier personnel has resulted in a violation of a provision of this part, the CRO must take, or direct other carrier personnel to take, whatever action is necessary to ensure compliance with this part.
              (b) If an alleged violation of a provision of this part has already occurred, and the CRO agrees that a violation has occurred, the CRO must provide to the complainant a written statement setting forth a summary of the facts and what steps, if any, the carrier proposes to take in response to the violation.
              (c) If the CRO determines that the carrier's action does not violate a provision of this part, the CRO must provide to the complainant a written statement including a summary of the facts and the reasons, under this part, for the determination.
              (d) The statements required to be provided under this section must inform the complainant of his or her right to pursue DOT enforcement action under this part. The CRO must provide the statement in person to the complainant at the airport if possible; otherwise, it must be forwarded to the complainant within 30 calendar days of the complaint.

              How must carriers respond to written complaints?

              (a) As a carrier providing service using aircraft with 19 or more passenger seats, you must respond to written complaints received by any means (e.g., letter, fax, e-mail, electronic instant message) concerning matters covered buy this part.
              (b) As a passenger making a written complaint, you must state whether you had contacted a CRO in the matter, provide the name of the CRO and the date of the contact, if available, and enclose any written response you received from the CRO.

              (c) As a carrier, you are not required to respond to a complaint postmarked or transmitted more than 45 days after the date of the incident, except for complaints referred to you by the Department of Transportation.
              (d) As a carrier, you must make a dispositive written response to a written disability complaint within 30 days of its receipt. The response must specifically admit or deny that a violation of this part has occurred.
              (1) If you admit that a violation has occurred, you must provide to the complainant a written statement setting forth a summary of the facts and the steps, if any, you will take in response to the violation.
              (2) If you deny that a violation has occurred, your response must include a summary of the facts and your reasons, under this part, for the determination.
              (3) Your response must also inform the complainant of his or her right to pursue DOT enforcement action under this part.

              § 382.157
              What are carriers' obligations for recordkeeping and reporting on disability-related complaints?
              (a) For the purposes of this section, a disability-related complaint means a specific written expression of dissatisfaction received from, or submitted on behalf, of an individual with a disability concerning a difficulty associated with the person's disability, which the person experienced when using or attempting to use an air carrier's or foreign carrier's services.
              (b) If you are a carrier covered by this part, conducting passenger operations with at least one aircraft having a designed seating capacity of more than 60 passengers, this section applies to you. As a foreign carrier, you are covered by this section only with respect to disability-related complaints associated with any flight segment originating or terminating in the United States.

              (c) You must categorize disability-related complaints that you receive according to the type of disability and nature of complaint. Data concerning a passenger's disability must be recorded separately in the following areas: vision impaired, hearing impaired, vision and hearing impaired, mentally impaired, communicable disease, allergies (e.g., food allergies, chemical sensitivity), paraplegic, quadriplegic, other wheelchair, oxygen, stretcher, other assistive device (cane, respirator, etc.), and other disability. Data concerning the alleged discrimination or service problem related to the disability must be separately recorded in the following areas: refusal to board, refusal to board without an attendant, security issues concerning disability, aircraft not accessible, airport not accessible, advance notice dispute, seating accommodation, failure to provide adequate or timely assistance, damage to assistive device, storage and delay of assistive device, service animal problem, unsatisfactory information, and other.

              (d) You must submit an annual report summarizing the disability-related complaints that you received during the prior calendar year using the form specified at the following internet address: http://382reporting.ost.dot.gov. You must submit this report by the last Monday in January of each year for complaints received during the prior calendar year. You must make submissions through the World Wide Web except for situations where you can demonstrate that you would suffer undue hardship if not permitted to submit the data via paper copies, disks, or e-mail, and DOT has approved an exception. All fields in the form must be completed; carriers are to enter “0” where there were no complaints in a given category. Each annual report must contain the following certification signed by your authorized representative: “I, the undersigned, do certify that this report has been prepared under my direction in accordance with the regulations in 14 CFR Part 382. I affirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this is a true, correct, and complete report.” Electronic signatures will be accepted.
              (e) You must retain correspondence and record of action taken on all disability-related complaints for three years after receipt of the complaint or creation of the record of action taken. You must make these records available to Department of Transportation officials at their request.

              (f)(1) As either carrier in a codeshare relationship, you must comply with paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section for—
              (i) Disability-related complaints you receive from or on behalf of passengers with respect to difficulties encountered in connection with service you provide;
              (ii) Disability-related complaints you receive from or on behalf of passengers when you are unable to reach agreement with your codeshare partner as to whether the complaint involves service you provide or service your codeshare partner provides; and
              (iii) Disability-related complaints forwarded by another carrier or governmental agency with respect to difficulties encountered in connection with service you provide.
              (2) As either carrier in a codeshare relationship, you must forward to your codeshare partner disability-related complaints you receive from or on behalf of passengers with respect to difficulties encountered in connection with service provided by your code-sharing partner.
              (g) Each carrier, except for carriers in codeshare situations, shall comply with paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section for disability-related complaints it receives from or on behalf of passengers as well as disability-related complaints forwarded by another carrier or governmental agency with respect to difficulties encountered in connection with service it provides.
              (h) Carriers that do not submit their data via the Web shall use the disability-related complaint data form specified in appendix A to this part when filing their annual report summarizing the disability-related complaints they received. The report shall be mailed, by the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, to the following address: U.S. Department of Transportation, Aviation Consumer Protection Division (C-75), 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., West Building, Room W96-432, Washington, DC 20590.

              § 385.2
              Applicability.

              This part describes the organization of the Department insofar as, pursuant to authority conferred on it by section 40113 of the Statute, the Department has adopted rules herein or elsewhere which make continuing assignments of authority with respect to any of its functions of making orders or other determinations, many of which are not required to be made on an evidentiary record upon notice and hearing or which are not the subject of contest, and Department personnel have been assigned to perform such functions. Delegations by the Secretary of Transportation to Secretarial Officers and the Director, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of functions under Subparts I, II, and IV of the Statute appear in 49 CFR part 1. This part also sets forth the procedures governing discretionary review by the appropriate Reviewing Official of action taken under such assignments. Nothing in this part shall be construed as precluding the Department from issuing, by appropriate order, temporary delegations of authority with respect to any functions described in this part or with respect to any other functions which can be lawfully delegated.

              Scope of staff action.
              Applications for relief which, pursuant to this part, may be granted by staff members under assigned authority, and proceedings on such requests shall be governed by applicable rules in the same manner as if no assignment had been made (see § 385.5). In such proceedings, each staff member may determine any procedural matters which may arise, including, inter alia, service of documents on additional persons; filing of otherwise unauthorized documents; waivers of procedural requirements; requests for hearing; requests for additional information; dismissal of applications upon the applicant's request, moot applications, or incomplete or otherwise defective applications; and extensions of time. Such determinations, except those which would terminate the matter, shall be subject to review only in connection with review of the staff member's decision on the merits. The dismissal of incomplete or otherwise defective applications under authority set forth in this part shall be without prejudice except where under otherwise applicable law the time for making application has run out or where the defect is not corrected within a reasonable time fixed by the staff member. Under the authority assigned to the staff as set forth in this part to approve, disapprove, grant, or deny, relief may be granted or denied in part and grants may be made subject to lawful and reasonable conditions. Moreover, where applicable, the authority to grant relief also includes authority to renew or extend an existing authorization.

              § 385.4
              Form of staff action.
              Unless otherwise specified, staff action shall be by order or informal writing (letters, telegrams, decision marked on copy of application form, etc.). Such orders or informal writings shall contain a recital that action is taken pursuant to authority assigned herein, shall, in cases where there are “parties or interveners,” or where there may be an adverse effect upon a person with a substantial interest, contain a brief reference to the right of aggrieved parties to petition the Reviewing Official for review pursuant to applicable procedural rules, including a statement of the time within which petitions must be filed (§ 385.51); shall state whether the filing of a petition shall preclude the action from becoming effective; and shall be in the name of the person exercising the assigned function. They shall contain all findings, determinations and conclusions which would be required or appropriate if they were issued by the Secretary. Upon request, the appropriate Department Official shall attest as Departmental action orders or informal writings issued pursuant to this part which have become the action of the Department (§ 385.52).

              Procedures set forth in this part do not supersede procedures applicable to matters on which decision has been assigned unless otherwise specifically provided herein: Provided, however, That any provisions in other regulations which provide for reconsideration of nonhearing determinations are not applicable to decisions made under authority assigned herein or to decisions made upon review thereof by the Reviewing Official.
            
            
              
              § 385.6
              Referral to the Reviewing Official.
              When the staff member finds that the public interest so requires, or that, with respect to other than matters requiring immediate action as hereafter specified, there will be insufficient time for discretionary review of his or her decision upon petition, the staff member shall, in lieu of exercising the authority, submit the matter to the Reviewing Official for decision. In any case in which the staff member finds that immediate action is required with respect to any matter assigned herein, the disposition of which is governed by prior precedent and policy, the staff member may take appropriate action and specify that the filing of a petition for review shall not preclude such action from becoming effective.
            
            
              § 385.7
              Exercise of authority by superiors.
              Any assignment of authority to a staff member other than the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the Administrative Law Judge, and the Deputy General Counsel, shall also be deemed to be made, severally, to each such staff member's respective superiors. In accordance with the Department's principle of management responsibility, the superior may choose to exercise the assigned power personally. Moreover, the Secretary may at any time exercise any authority assigned herein.
            
            
              § 385.8
              Exercise of authority in “acting” capacity.
              Unless the assignment provides otherwise, staff members serving in an “acting” capacity may exercise the authority assigned to the staff members for whom they are acting.

Petitions for review shall be filed and served within seven (7) days after the date of the staff action to which they relate, but a different period may be fixed in such staff action consistent with effective preservation of the right to petition for discretionary review and the exigencies of the situation.
              (b) Contents. Petitions for review shall demonstrate that (1) a finding of material fact is clearly erroneous; (2) a legal conclusion is contrary to law, Department rules, or precedent; (3) a substantial and important question of policy is involved; (4) a prejudicial procedural error has occurred; or (5) the staff action is substantially deficient on its face. The petition shall briefly and specifically state the alleged grounds for review and the relief sought. If persons who participated at the staff action level set forth any new facts, arguments, or other new matter, an explanation must be furnished as to why said matter was not previously adduced at the staff action level. In the absence of a valid explanation, the Department may disregard such new matter.
              (c) Form and filing. Petitions shall comply with the form and filing requirements of §§ 302.3 and 302.4 of this chapter. (Rules of practice in Economic Proceedings). Petitions shall not exceed 10 pages in length. A greater length, however, may be specified in the staff action taken. The petitions shall be accompanied by proof of required service. However, persons who seek review of a civil penalty proposed by the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings pursuant to § 385.15(a) may submit their request therefor by letter to the Department with a copy to the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings and need not comply with the above form and filing requirements.
              (d) Service. A petition filed by a person other than the applicant shall be served on the applicant. Petitions shall also be served on any persons who have served documents on the petitioner at the staff action level; and on such other persons as may be directed by the Department or the staff member who took the action to be reviewed.
              (e) Answers. The applicant and such other persons as disclose a substantial interest which would be adversely affected by the relief sought in the petition may, within seven (7) days after filing the petition, file an answer thereto. A different period for the filing of answers may be fixed in the staff action. Such answers shall comply with the form and filing requirements applicable to petitions and shall be served on the applicant and any other person who has theretofore served a document in the matter on such respondent.

              (1) Each applicant shall set forth briefly and succinctly the relief that it seeks and the reasons why such relief should be granted. Waivers or modifications of stated fees shall be granted only where it is demonstrated that such action is in the public interest because furnishing of the information requested can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public.
              (2) Applications requesting waivers or modifications of fees under this section shall be addressed to the Managing Director, who has been delegated authority by the Board to decide such applications in § 385.12 of this chapter, and shall accompany the request for service under this section.
              (3) The Managing Director shall either rule on the application or, at his discretion, pass the matter on to the Board for its determination.

              Special rules for tariff page filings.
              (a) Tariffs issued by carriers. The filing fee for tariff pages filed by U.S. air carriers will be charged even if the tariff includes matters involving participating foreign air carriers. It will also be charged if the tariff is issued by a foreign air carrier and includes matters involving participating U.S. air carriers, unless the foreign air carrier has obtained a waiver under § 389.24. The fee will not be charged for a blank looseleaf page unless it cancels matter in the preceding issue of the page.
              (b) Tariffs issued by publishing agents. (1) If the tariff is issued for one or more air carriers exclusively, the fee will be charged for each page.
              (2) If the tariff is issued for one or more air carriers and one or more foreign air carriers, the fee will be charged for each page, except for those pages that the issuing agent states contain only:
              (i) Matters pertaining exclusively to foreign air carriers that have been granted a waiver, or

              (ii) Changes in matters pertaining to foreign air carriers that have been granted a waiver and that are included on the same page with other matters that are reissued without change.
              (3) The fee will not be charged for a blank looseleaf page unless it cancels matters in the preceding page.
              (4) No fee will be charged when two pages are published back-to-back, one page is not subject to the fee under paragraph (b)(2), and the page on the reverse is issued without substantive change.
              (5) The fee will be charged for two looseleaf pages containing a correction number check sheet unless all other pages of the tariff are exempt from the fee.

              Refund of fee.
              (a) Any fee charged under this part may be refunded in full or in part upon request if the document for which it is charged is withdrawn before final action is taken. Such requests shall be filed in accordance with § 389.23.
              (b) Any person may file an application for refund of a fee paid since April 28, 1977, on the grounds that such fee exceeded the Board's cost in providing the service. The application shall be filed with the Board's Comptroller and shall contain: the amount paid, the date paid, and the category of service.

            § 398.1
            Purpose.
            The purpose of this part is to establish general guidelines for the determination of basic essential air service for each eligible place under 49 U.S.C. 41731 and 41732. Procedures for the determination of the essential air service level for a place are contained in part 325 of this chapter.
          
          
            § 398.2
            Number and designation of hubs.
            (a) What is a hub? The Department considers hubs as belonging to any one of three classifications:
            (1) A large hub is a place accounting for at least 1.00 percent of the total enplanements in the United States;
            (2) A medium hub is a place accounting for at least 0.25 percent but less than 1.00 percent of the total enplanements in the United States; and
            (3) A small hub is a place accounting for at least 0.05 percent but less than 0.25 percent of the total enplanements in the United States.
            (b) How many hubs? (1) As a general matter, the Department will require service to one large or medium hub.
            (2) In Alaska or when the nearest large or medium hub is more than 400 miles from the eligible place, the Department may instead require service to a small hub or nonhub.
            (3) In some cases, the Department may require service to two hubs, of which at least one will be a large or medium hub. The Department will require service to two hubs if an eligible place has close commercial, geographic, and political ties to both hubs and if there is sufficient traffic from the eligible place to support two round trips a day to both hubs. If traffic is not sufficient, the Department may require one round trip a day to both hubs if the community requests such service.
            (4) In no event will essential air service consist of service to more than two hubs.
            (c) Which hub? (1) In designating hubs, the Department will weigh all of the following factors:
            (i) The extent to which candidate hubs provide access to the national air transportation system;
            (ii) The commercial, geographic, and political ties of candidate hubs to the eligible place;
            (iii) The traffic levels to candidate hubs, as shown by traffic studies and origin and designation data;
            (iv) The distance of candidate hubs from the eligible place; and
            (v) The size of candidate hubs. Large size will be a positive factor, but principally as substantiating the access and community-ties factors.
            (2) For Alaska, rather than requiring service to a hub, the Department may instead require that service from an eligible place be provided to a nearby focal point for traffic which, in turn, has service to a hub.
          
          
            § 398.3
            Specific airports.

            (a) At an eligible place, essential air service may be specified as service to a particular airport. In the case of hyphenated places, essential air service will be specified as service to more than one airport only if clearly necessary and if the multi-airport service is economically feasible and justified on the basis of traffic levels at those airports.
            
            (b) At a hub, essential air service is not usually specified as service to a particular airport.
          
          
            § 398.4
            Equipment.
            (a) Except in Alaska, service will be provided by aircraft offering at least 15 passenger seats, unless:
            (1) Average daily enplanements at the place did not exceed 11 passengers for any fiscal year from 1976 through 1986;
            (2) The requirement would necessitate the payment of compensation in a fiscal year for service at the place when compensation would otherwise not be necessary; or
            (3) The affected community agrees in writing to the use of smaller aircraft to provide service at the place.
            (b) The aircraft must have at least two engines and use two pilots, unless scheduled air transportation has not been provided to the place in aircraft with at least two engines and using two pilots for at least 60 consecutive operating days at any time since October 31, 1978.
            (c) The aircraft must be pressurized when the service regularly involves flights above 8,000 feet in altitude.
            (d) All aircraft must meet the applicable safety standards of the Federal Aviation Administration.
            (e) The aircraft must be conveniently accessible to passengers by stairs rather than over the wing.
          
          
            § 398.5
            Frequency of flights.
            (a) Except in Alaska, at least two round trips each weekday and two round trips each weekend.
            (b) In Alaska, a level of service at least equal to that provided in 1976, or two round trips each week, whichever is greater, except that the Department and the appropriate State authority of Alaska may agree to a different level of service after consulting with the affected community.
            (c) An essential air service level may be set at more than that stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if:
            (1) Historical traffic data and studies of traffic-generating potential for the place indicate that more frequent service is needed to accommodate passengers and accompanying baggage with the aircraft used at that place;
            (2) More flights are needed because the capacity available to the eligible place is being shared with traffic destined for an intermediate stop or for a place beyond the eligible place;
            (3) More flights are needed to accommodate passengers because smaller aircraft are being used at the place;
            (4) More flights are needed in order to ensure adequate connecting opportunities as provided for by § 398.7; or
            (5) For Alaska, the appropriate state agency agrees that more frequent service is needed to accommodate cargo traffic with the aircraft used at the eligible place.
            (d) For eligible places where traffic levels vary substantially with the season, a two-tier level of essential air service may be established with required flight frequencies changing accordingly.
          
          
            § 398.6
            Seat guarantees.
            (a) The number of seats guaranteed at the eligible place will be sufficient to accommodate the estimated passenger traffic at an average load factor of 60 percent, except that an average load factor of 50 percent will be used when service is provided with aircraft having fewer than 15 passenger seats.
            (b) Only under unusual circumstances will an eligible place's essential air service level be set at a number of flights that will accommodate more than 40 passengers a day in each direction (a total of 80 inbound and outbound passengers). Generally, 40 passengers can be accommodated by guaranteeing 67 seats a day in each direction (a total of 134 inbound and outbound seats).
            (c) The Department may guarantee an eligible place more than 67 seats a day if:
            (1) The number of stops between or beyond the eligible place and the hub results in available aircraft capacity being shared with passengers at those other places;
            (2) The distance between the eligible place and the designated hub requires the use of large aircraft;

            (3) The eligible place has suffered an abrupt and significant reduction in its service that warrants a temporary increase in the maximum guaranteed capacity; or
            
            (4) Other unusual circumstances warrant guaranteeing the eligible place more than 67 seats a day.
          
          
            § 398.7
            Timing of flights.

            To qualify as essential air service, flights must depart at reasonable times, considering the needs of passengers with connecting flights at the hub. It is the policy of the Department to consider the reasonableness of the time in view of the purpose for which the local passengers are traveling. If travel is primarily to connect with other flights at the hub, local flight times should be designed to link with those flights. If travel is primarily local (i.e., to and from the hub), there should be at least one morning flight in each direction and one late-afternoon or evening flight in each direction.
          
          
            § 398.8
            Number of intermediate stops.
            (a) Except in Alaska, no more than one intermediate stop is permitted in providing essential air service between the eligible place and its hub, unless otherwise agreed to with the community. In cases where an eligible place receives service to two hubs, however, more than one intermediate stop is permitted between that place and its secondary hub.
            (b) In Alaska, more than one intermediate stop is permitted if required by low traffic levels at the eligible place or by the long distance between the eligible place and its hub.
            (c) The Department may specify nonstop service when necessary to make the service viable.
            (d) Where an eligible place normally is an intermediate stop that shares available capacity with another place, it is the policy of the Department either to require additional capacity (more flights or larger aircraft) between the eligible place and its hub or to specify some turnaround operations on that route segment.
          
          
            § 398.9
            Load factor standards.
            The load factor standards used in this part may be raised for individual eligible places under either of the following circumstances:
            (a) The place is served by the carrier as part of a linear route; or
            (b) It would be in the interest of the community, the carrier, or the general public to raise the load factor standard for that place.
          
          
            § 398.10
            Overflights.
            The Department considers it a violation of 49 U.S.C. 41732 and the air service guarantees provided under this part for an air carrier providing essential air service to an eligible place to overfly that place, except under one or more of the following circumstances:
            (a) The carrier is not compensated for serving that place and another carrier is providing by its flights the service required by the Department's essential air service determination for that place;
            (b) Circumstances beyond the carrier's control prevent it from landing at the eligible place;
            (c) The flight involved is not in a market where the Department has determined air service to be essential; or
            (d) The eligible place is a place in Alaska for which the Department's essential air service determination permits the overflight.
          
          
            § 398.11
            Funding reductions.
            (a) If, in any fiscal year, appropriations for payments to air carriers remain at or below the amounts estimated as necessary to maintain subsidy-supported essential air service at the places receiving such service, and Congress provides no statutory direction to the contrary, appropriations shall not be available for essential air service to otherwise eligible places within the 48 contiguous States and Puerto Rico that have a rate of subsidy per passenger in excess of $200.00, or are located:
            (1) Less than 70 highway miles from the nearest large or medium hub airport;
            (2) Less than 55 miles from the nearest small hub airport; or

            (3) Less than 45 highway miles from the nearest nonhub airport that has enplaned, on certificated or commuter carriers, 100 or more passengers per day in the most recent year for which the Department has obtained complete data.
            
            (b) The rate of subsidy per passenger shall be calculated by dividing the annual subsidy in effect as of July 1 of the prior fiscal year by the total origin-and-destination traffic during the most recent year for which the Department has obtained complete data.

              § 399.1
              Applicability.
              All statements of general policy adopted by the Board for the guidance of the public will be published in this part, except as provided in § 399.2.
            
            
              § 399.2
              Exclusions.
              The following types of policies are generally not included in this part:
              (a) Policies relating solely to the internal management of the Board;
              (b) Policies requiring secrecy in the public interest or in the interest of national defense;
              (c) Policies that are repetitive of section 102 of the Act;
              (d) Policies that are fully expressed in a procedural or substantive rule of the Board, or in any opinion, decision, order, certificate, permit, exemption, or waiver of the Board;
              (e) Expressions of encouragement or admonition to industry to follow a certain course of action;
              (f) Positions on legislative items and on other matters that are outside the scope of the Board's current statutory powers and duties.
              [PS-21, 29 FR 1446, Jan. 29, 1964, as amended by PS-63, 40 FR 6643, Feb. 13, 1975]
            
            
              § 399.3
              Statements in other Board documents.
              No statement contained in any Board opinion, decision, order, certificate, permit, exemption, or waiver shall be considered a statement of policy within the meaning of this part, even though such statements may constitute a precedent in future cases or declare future policy to be followed in like cases. Similarly, a denial by the Board or relief sought, or statements of the Board's reasons for failure to issue a rule upon which rulemaking proceedings have been commenced shall not be considered statements of policy, except to the extent that it is specifically stated that such denial or failure is based upon a policy thereafter to be followed.
            
            
              § 399.4
              Nature and effect of policy statements.

              Policy statements published in this part will be observed by the Board until rescinded, but any policy may be amended from time to time as experience or changing conditions may require. Changes in policy may be made with or without advance notice to the public and will become effective upon publication in the Federal Register unless otherwise provided. If it appears to the Board, in its consideration of any matter before it, that the application of a policy published in this part would run counter to an express provision of law or policy enunciated by Congress in the Act, the published policy shall not be applicable to such matter.
            
            
              § 399.5
              Arrangement of policy statements.
              The statements of general policy relating to the various duties and functions of the Board are grouped according to subject matter in the following subparts; the titles of the subparts indicate the general subject matter included therein.

              § 399.12
              Negotiation by air carriers for landing rights in foreign countries.
              (a) It is the policy of the Board (jointly with the Department of State) that, as a general rule, landing rights abroad for United States flag air carriers will be acquired through negotiation by the U.S. Government with foreign governments rather than by direct negotiation between an air carrier and a foreign government.

              (b) It is corollary to the foregoing policy that no United States air carrier may avail itself of representations by one foreign government to further its interest with another foreign government, especially with respect to landing rights, except insofar as such representations have been specifically authorized by the U.S. Government.

              § 399.18
              Maximum duration of fixed-term route authorization granted by exemption; renewal of such authority.
              It is the policy of the Board to limit the duration of exemptions which authorize fixed-term route service to a maximum period of two years, and to entertain requests for renewal of such authority only when incorporated in a duly filed application for substantially equivalent certificate authority under section 401 of the Act. (See § 377.10(c) of this chapter (Special Regulations).)

              In deciding applications for exemptions from section 41102 of Title 49 of the United States Code by air carriers seeking to perform charter service in air transportation, we will give primary weight to the chartering public's own assessment of the air carrier services that best meet its transportation needs. Therefore, we will not, as a general rule, consider as relevant to our decision on such applications, objections based upon (1) offers by the objectors to perform the charter service, and/or (2) estimates of revenue or traffic diversion, unless in the latter case the objectors demonstrate that the diversion resulting from grant of the exemption would threaten their ability to fulfill their certificate obligations.

            Subpart C—Policies Relating to Rates and Tariffs
            
              § 399.30
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart:
              
                DPFI formula fare means the trunk coach formula fare on July 1, 1977, as established by the Board in Phase 9 of the Domestic Passenger Fares Investigation (Docket 21866-9).
              
                SIFL means the standard industry fare level, as set forth in § 399.31.
              [PS-92, 45 FR 24118, Apr. 9, 1980]
            
            
              § 399.31
              Standard industry fare level.
              (a) Generally. Except as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, the standard industry fare level (“SIFL”) for coach/standard service in a market is equal to the predominant fare in effect in that market on July 1, 1977, as adjusted by the Board for cost increases.
              (b) Predominant fare. For each market, the predominant fare in effect on July 1, 1977, is presumed to be as set forth below. The presumption may be rebutted, however, by showing that more passengers used a higher fare.
              (1) For U.S. Mainland-Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands markets where the Board has specified day-of-week fare differentials: the peak-season midweek fare appearing in tariffs in effect on July 1, 1977.
              (2) For U.S. Mainland-Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands markets where the Board has specified only seasonal fare differentials: the off-peak-season fare appearing in tariffs in effect on July 1, 1977.
              (3) For U.S. Mainland-Hawaii markets: the peak-season second class fare appearing in tariffs in effect on July 1, 1977.
              (4) For all other interstate and overseas markets: the lowest unrestricted fare in effect on July 1, 1977.
              (c) Adjustments for cost increases. The Board adjusts the SIFL at least once every 6 months by the percentage change, since the previous adjustment, in the actual operating cost per available seat-mile for interstate and overseas transportation combined. The method of adjustment is illustrated in the example set out at the end of this subpart.
              (d) Intrastate markets in California, Florida, and Texas. For each of these markets, the SIFL is equal to the level that it would be if the market were an interstate one whose predominant fare on July 1, 1977, was the DPFI formula fare.
              (e) Intra-Hawaii markets. For intra-Hawaii markets, the Board's flexibility zones are based not on the SIFL, but on the standard Hawaiian fare level (“SHFL”), which is equal to 110 percent of the first class fare in effect on July 1, 1977, as adjusted by the Board for cost increases.
              [PS-92, 45 FR 24118, Apr. 9, 1980, as amended by PS-95, 45 FR 42255, June 24, 1980; PS-96, 45 FR 48604, July 21, 1980]
            
            
              § 399.32
              Zone of limited suspension for domestic passenger fares.
              (a) Applicability. This section sets forth the Board's policy on passenger fares for scheduled service by certificated air carriers in the following areas, except to the extent that greater flexibility is set forth in § 399.33:
              (1) Within the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia (“the Mainland”); and
              (2) Between the Mainland and Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, or Alaska.
              (b) Downward flexibility. Each carrier may set fares in each market at any amount below the SIFL. The Board will not suspend such a fare on the ground that its level is unreasonable, except in the following extraordinary circumstances:
              (1) There is a high probability that the fare would be found to be unlawful after investigation;
              (2) There is a substantial likelihood that the fare is predatory so that there would be an immediate and irreparable harm to competition if the fare were allowed to go into effect;
              (3) The harm to competition is greater than the injury to the traveling public if the proposed fare were unavailable; and
              (4) The suspension is in the public interest.
              (c) [Reserved]
              (d) Upward flexibility. Each carrier may set fares above the SIFL as follows, and where they are so set, the Board will not suspend them on the grounds that their level is unreasonable except upon a clear showing of abuse of market power that the Board does not expect to be corrected through marketplace forces:

              (1) For service on the Mainland: Up to 30 percent above the sum of the SIFL plus $14. Each time after January 13, 1981, that the Board adjusts the SIFL for cost increases in accordance with § 399.31(c), it will adjust the $14 figure by the same percentage rounded to the nearest whole dollar. The Board order announcing the adjustment will be published in the Federal Register and served on all certificated carriers, and copies will be available through the Domestic Fares and Rates Division, Bureau of Domestic Aviation, Civil Aeronautics Board, Washington, D.C. 20428.
              (2) For service between the Mainland and Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, or Alaska: Up to 30 percent above the SIFL.
              (e) Fares above the zone. Tariff filings that state fares above the applicable zone must include the data and information set forth in § 221.165 of this chapter. For peak fares, this must include a description of the carrier's off-peak fares that are available in the market. The Board will suspend a fare above the zone that it finds not to be justified by cost or competitive factors.

              § 399.33
              Additional fare flexibility.
              For scheduled service in the areas set forth in § 399.32(a), certificated air carriers have the following fare flexibility in addition to that set forth in § 399.32:
              (a) First class. Carriers may without restriction set the level of first class fares.
              (b) Small aircraft. Carriers may without restriction set the level of fares for service with aircraft designed to have a maximum passenger capacity of 60 or fewer seats.
              (c) Through service and on-line connecting service. For through service and on-line connecting service, carriers may set their fares up to the sum of the local fares minus one tax-rounded coach ceiling terminal charge for each local fare after the first, if that level is higher than the ceiling set forth in § 399.32(d). The Board will not suspend such a fare on the ground that its level is unreasonable except upon a clear showing of abuse of market power that the Board does not expect to be corrected through marketplace forces.

              § 399.34
              Intra-Hawaii and Intra-Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands fare flexibility.
              For scheduled service within Hawaii, and within and between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, certificated air carriers have the fare flexibility set forth in §§ 399.32 and 399.33, except that:
              (a) Instead of the limits set forth in § 399.32(d), the upper limit of the zone for Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands is 30 percent above the SIFL, and for Hawaii is 30 percent above the SHFL; and
              (b) The fare flexibility set forth in § 399.33(a) (first class) does not apply to service within Hawaii.

              § 399.35
              Special tariff permission.
              (a) Definition. As used in this section, to grant STP means to approve a carrier's application for Special Tariff Permission to file a tariff on less than the statutory notice set forth in § 221.160(a) of this chapter.
              (b) Lower fares, rates, and charges. It is the policy of the Board to grant STP for tariffs that state lower fares, rates, or charges and any rules affecting only those lower fares, rates, or charges, except that:
              (1) The Board will not grant STP to match a tariff filed on statutory notice; and

              (2) The Board will not grant STP if the proposed fares, rates, charges, or rules raise significant questions of lawfulness, that is, could reasonably be expected to be found unjust or unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential, unduly prejudicial, or predatory, under current statutory or Board guidelines. In these situations, if the carrier files the tariff on statutory notice and at the same time applies for STP to advance the tariff's effective date, the Board will use its best efforts to act within 15 days to grant or deny STP.
              (c) Higher fares or rates. For tariffs that state higher fares or rates, and any rules affecting only those fares or rates, the Board's policy on STP is, except in unusual or emergency circumstances:
              (1) To grant STP if the resulting fares or rates are within a statutory or Board-established zone of fare or rate flexibility; and
              (2) Otherwise, to deny STP.

              Unreasonable discrimination.
              (a) As used in this section:
              (1) Unreasonable discrimination means unjust discrimination or unreasonable preference or prejudice; and
              (2) Rate means rate, fare, or charge.
              (b) Except in unusual circumstances or as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the Board will find a rate for domestic air transportation to constitute unreasonable discrimination only if:
              (1) There is a reasonable probability that the rate will result in significant long-run economic injury to passengers or shippers;
              (2) The rate is in fact discriminatory according to a reasonable cost allocation or other rational basis;
              (3) The rate does not provide transportation or other statutorily recognized benefits that justify the discrimination; and
              (4) Actual and potential competitive forces cannot reliably be expected to eliminate the undesirable effects of the discrimination within a reasonable period.
              (c) A rate that discriminates on the basis of the status of the traffic carried will not be presumed to be unreasonably discriminatory, unless the use of the status categories in question is contrary to established national anti-discrimination policy.

              There should be joint fares in all markets over all routings within the contiguous 48 states and the District of Columbia as follows:
              (a) Level. The level shall not exceed the sum of the maximum local fares permitted by this subpart minus one tax-rounded coach ceiling terminal charge for each interline connection, and in any event shall not exceed the sum of the actual local fares.
              (b) Division. Joint fares shall be divided according to the relative costs of the mileage flown by each carrier participating in the interline movement. However, where a joint fare is equal to the sum of the actual local fares, each carrier shall get the local fare as its share.

              Equipment purchase deposits are advance payments made by air carriers to manufacturers for the purchase of equipment to be delivered in the future, or funds segregated by air carriers for this purpose. It is the policy of the Board not to recognize equipment purchase deposits in an air carrier's investment base for ratemaking purposes. When equipment is acquired by an air carrier and placed in air-transport service, the Board will recognize in the air carrier's investment base interest on purchase deposits on such equipment capitalized and amortized in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts and Reports for Certificated Air Carriers (part 241 of this chapter).

              § 399.41
              Zones of limited suspension for international cargo rates.
              (a) Applicability. This section states the Board's policy for suspending rate changes for the transportation of property in foreign air transportation. It does not affect the Board's authority to suspend any rate as unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential, or unduly prejudicial. This section applies to rate changes by all direct air carriers and direct foreign air carriers.
              (b) Standard foreign rate levels. For each market in foreign air transportation, the standard foreign rate level for the carriage of property shall be the bulk general commodity rates in effect in that market on April 1, 1982, as adjusted in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. However, the general commodity rate for shipments larger than 500 kg. shall be deemed to be the same as the 500 kg. rate for the purposes of this paragraph, regardless of any different rate in effect in the market.
              (c) Ceilings of limited rate suspension. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Board will not suspend as unreasonable any proposed rate for foreign air transportation of property equal to or less than the following levels:
              (1) For all bulk rates (GCR's and SCR's) in the Atlantic region, 20 percent above the standard foreign rate level.
              (2) For all bulk rates (GCR's and SCR's) in the Pacific region, 15 percent above the standard foreign rate level.
              (3) For all bulk rates (GCR's and SCR's) in the Western Hemisphere region (except Mexico and Canada), 5 percent above the standard foreign rate level.
              (4) For all bulk rates (GCR's and SCR's) in Canada/Mexico transborder markets, 10 percent above the standard foreign rate level for the Western Hemisphere.
              (5) For all container rates, no maximum level.
              (d) Extraordinary circumstances. The Board may suspend any tariff if it finds that:
              (1) The suspension is in the public interest because of unreasonable regulatory action by a foreign government with respect to rate proposals of an air carrier, or
              (2) All of the following extraordinary circumstances are present:
              (i) It is highly probable that the fare would be found unreasonable after investigation;
              (ii) There is a substantial likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm to the public if the rate is allowed to go into effect; and
              (iii) The suspension is required by the public interest.
              (e) Burden of proof. Persons requesting tariff suspension under paragraph (d) of this section shall have the burden of producing convincing evidence that the conditions of that paragraph are present.
              (f) Standard foreign rate level adjustments. (1) The Board will periodically adjust the standard foreign rate levels to reflect the percentage change in average operating costs per available ton-mile since the previous adjustment.
              (2) Costs will be averaged for three regions—the Atlantic, the Pacific, and Western Hemisphere—and applied equally among all markets in each region.
              (3) Cost computations will be based on scheduled freighter and combination service by U.S. air carriers.
              (4) Adjustments will be made on April 1 and October 1 of each year, or more frequently as the Board finds appropriate.
              (5) In computing costs under this section, the Board will make no adjustments for load factors, aircraft utilization, or other matters due to operational decisions made solely by carrier management. However, the Board retains the discretion to normalize costs for strikes, mandatory aircraft groundings, and other occurrences not solely due to management decisions.
              (g) Definitions. For the purpose of this section:
              (1) GCR means general commodity rate.
              (2) SCR means specific commodity rate.
              (3) Container rate means any rate specifically applicable to property tendered to the carrier in a unit load devise.

              Treatment of leased aircraft.
              In determining the appropriate treatment of leased aircraft for ratemaking purposes, it is the Board's policy to recognize actual rental expenses. In unusual circumstances where the leased aircraft value (determined on a constructive depreciated basis) in relation to net book value of owned aircraft operated by the same air carrier is significantly in excess of the ratio for the aggregate of the domestic trunklines and local service carriers (computed on the same basis), a reasonable profit element may be added which shall reflect the additional risks of operations with the leased aircraft, to the extent that such risks are not compensated by the return on investment. Such profit element would be determined by applying the standard rate of return, less 6 percentage points, to the value of the leased aircraft, on a constructive depreciated basis, to the extent the ratio of such value to depreciated cost of owned aircraft plus the value of leased aircraft exceeds the average for the domestic air carriers. Rental cost plus allowable profit, if any, will not be recognized in amounts exceeding depreciation plus return on investment computed as if the aircraft had been purchased by the carrier.

              § 399.44
              Treatment of deferred Federal income taxes for rate purposes.
              For rate-making purposes other than the determination of subsidy under section 406(b), it is the policy of the Board that Federal income tax expense should be based on the normal taxes that would be paid under the depreciation standards used for rate making, and that accumulated reserves for deferred taxes should be excluded from the recognized capitalization for rate-base purposes.

              § 399.60
              Standards for determining priorities of hearing.
              (a) General. This policy statement describes the general standards which will be used by the Board in determining the order in which it will designate for hearing those matters on its docket which are to be decided after notice and hearing. Among such matters are applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity or for foreign air carrier permits; applications under section 408 of the Act for approval of consolidations or acquisitions of control; complaint cases; and various rate-making proceedings.
              (b) Standards. Matters will be assigned for hearing in accordance with the degree of relative priority which each matter is entitled to on the basis of the comparative public interest involved therein. Among other things, the Board will take into account:
              (1) Statutory requirements for preference or statutory limitations on the time within which the Board shall act;
              (2) The impact of delay on the public or particular persons;
              (3) The need for promptly securing compliance with the provisions of the Act;
              (4) The time for which the matter has already been pending and which would be required to dispose of it;
              (5) Whether the application requests renewal of an existing temporary authorization; and
              (6) In matters relating to operating authority:
              (i) Whether a proposal might reduce subsidy or increase economy of operations;
              (ii) Whether an application proposes new service;
              (iii) The volume of traffic that might be affected by the grant or denial of the proposal;
              (iv) The period that has elapsed since the Board considered the service needs of the places or areas involved; and

              (v) The relative availability of necessary staff members of the carriers, communities and the Board, in the light of other proceedings already in progress, to handle the processing of the case.
              
              Interested persons may urge upon the Board such considerations as they believe should lead it to accord a particular application a priority different from that which the Board has given it.
            
            
              § 399.61
              Presentations of public and civic bodies in route proceedings.
              For the purpose of implementing the Board's policy to provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence and otherwise to expedite route proceedings, and in light of experience, the following guidelines are hereby established:
              (a) Public and civic bodies which represent the same geographic area or community should consolidate their presentation of evidence, briefs or oral argument to the examiner and the Board;
              (b) A public body or a civic organization, or several such bodies or organizations whose presentation of evidence is consolidated, should keep to a minimum the number of witnesses used to present the factual evidence in support of the community's position;

              (c) Exhibits offered in evidence by a public body or civic organization should be limited to evidence of the economic characteristics of the community and area involved, data as to community of interest and traffic, evidence with respect to the sufficiency of existing service, and airport data, and should not include data relating to number of electricity, water and gas meters, telephones, schools, freight car loadings, building permits, sewer connections, or volume of bank deposits in the community.
            
            
              § 399.62
              Target dates in hearing cases.
              (a) Applicability. This section applies to initial and recommended decisions of administrative law judges, final decisions, and decisions on petitions for review or reconsideration in cases in which the Board has ordered a trial-type hearing before an administrative law judge.
              (b) Issuance of target dates. In cases to which this section applies, the Board or the administrative law judge, as the situation calls for, shall issue a notice of the target date for the completion of the initial or recommended decision, final decision, or decision on a petition for review or reconsideration. The Board or the administrative law judge shall endeavor to render the pending decision not later than the target date.
              (c) Time for promulgating target dates. (1) In the case of initial, recommended, or final decisions, notice of target dates shall be issued, served, and filed within 20 days of the submission of closing briefs, or the conclusion of oral argument to the administrative law judge or the Board, as may be appropriate.

              (2) In the case of petitions for review or for reconsideration, notices of target dates shall be issued, served, and filed within 20 days of the date for the filing of answers: Provided, That, in the case of petitions for reconsideration of Board decisions awarding new route authority, the Board shall, in lieu of issuing individual target dates, endeavor to render its decision no later than the day preceding the effective date of the new authority awarded.

              § 399.63
              Role of staff in route proceedings.
              (a) General. This policy statement establishes the standards applicable to staff participation in oral hearing cases involving award of route authority.
              (b) Standards. The staff's role during such hearings, primarily because it acts in the broad public interest, and not for a particular private or local interest, is to assure that essential evidence is introduced to resolve the public interest issues; that the evidence submitted by the parties is subject to adversary testing, and that decisional options are developed with the public interest in mind. In route cases designated by the Board that offer the opportunity for developing new policies to adapt to the administration of the Federal Aviation Act or that raise unusual evidentiary issues, a prehearing presentation by staff of decisional options will contribute to a better trial record, be consistent with traditional notions of fundamental fairness, better serve the Board's decisionmaking needs and ultimately serve the public interest. In any route case where the Board has not required the staff to participate by making a prehearing presentation, the staff shall present a prehearing presentation of decisional options if the administrative law judge finds that there exists unusual policy or evidentiary issues which clearly require such a presentation. We believe it is not desirable for the staff to advocate the adoption of a single decisional option at the outset of a case. Accordingly,
              (1) In route cases designated by the Board that offer the opportunity for developing new policies, the staff shall make a prehearing presentation of the decisional options available, and describe the kinds of evidence needed or available to develop each option. The staff need not and should not be required to develop evidence on each option. In every case, after the close of the hearing, however, the staff shall advocate a position based upon one or more of the decisional options identified in its prehearing presentation or developed at trial.
              (2) In any route case in which the administrative law judge finds that there exists unusual policy or evidentiary issues clearly requiring a prehearing presentation, the staff shall submit a prehearing statement of the decisional options available.

              (3) To the extent possible, the Board, in its instituting orders, will identify or designate the cases which involve the development of new policies or unusual evidentiary issues that will require the type of staff participation described in § 399.63(b)(1).

              The rules and policies relating to the disposition of rulemaking petitions by the Department of Transportation Office of the Secretary are located in its rulemaking procedures contained in 49 CFR part 5. The criteria for identifying significant rules and determining whether a regulatory analysis will be performed are set forth in the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures, 44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979, and Executive Order 12866.

              For the purposes of the Department's implementation of chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code (Regulatory Flexibility Act), a direct air carrier or foreign air carrier is a small business if it provides air transportation only with small aircraft as defined in § 298.3 of this chapter (up to 60 seats/18,000 pound payload capacity).

              § 399.80
              Unfair and deceptive practices of ticket agents.
              It is the policy of the Department to regard as an unfair or deceptive practice or unfair method of competition the practices enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (m) of this section by a ticket agent of any size and the practice enumerated in paragraph (s) by a ticket agent that sells air transportation online and is not considered a small business under the Small Business Administration's size standards set forth in 13 CFR 121.201:
              (a) Misrepresentations 1
                 which may induce members of the public to believe that the ticket agent is an air carrier.
              
                
                  1 The word “misrepresentation” used in this list includes any statement or representation made in advertising or made orally to members of the public which is false, fraudulent, deceptive or misleading, or which has the tendency or capacity to deceive or mislead.
              
              (b) Using or displaying or permitting or suffering to be used or displayed the name, trade name, slogan or any abbreviation thereof, of the ticket agent, in advertisements, on or in places of business, or on aircraft in connection with the name of an air carrier with whom it does business, in such manner that it may mislead or confuse the traveling public with respect to the agency status of the ticket agent.
              (c) Misrepresentations as to the quality or kind of service, type or size of aircraft, time of departure or arrival, points served, route to be flown, stops to be made, or total trip-time from point of departure to destination.
              (d) Misrepresentation as to qualifications of pilots or safety record or certification of pilots, aircraft or air carriers.
              (e) Misrepresentations that passengers are directly insured when they are not so insured; for example, where the only insurance in force is that protecting the air carrier in event of liability.
              (f) Misrepresentations as to fares and charges for air transportation or services in connection therewith.
              (g) Misrepresentation that special discounts or reductions are available, when such discounts or reductions are not specific in the lawful tariffs of the air carrier which is to perform the transportation.
              (h) [Reserved]
              (i) Misrepresentations that special priorities for reservations are available when such special considerations are not in fact granted to members of the public generally.

              (j) Selling air transportation to persons on a reservation or charter basis for specified space, flight, or time, or representing that such definite reservation or charter is or will be available or has been arranged, without a binding commitment with an air carrier for the furnishing of such definite reservation or charter as represented or sold.
              (k) Selling or issuing tickets or other documents to passengers to be exchanged or used for air transportation knowing or having reason to know or believe that such tickets or other documents will not be or cannot be legally honored by air carriers for air transportation.
              (l) Failing or refusing to make proper refunds promptly when service cannot be performed as contracted or representing that such refunds are obtainable only at some other point, thus depriving persons of the immediate use of the money to arrange other transportation, or forcing them to suffer unnecessary inconveniences and delays or requiring them to accept transportation at higher cost, or under less desirable circumstances, or on less desirable aircraft than that represented at the time of sale.
              (m) Misrepresentations regarding the handling, forwarding or routing of baggage or other property, or the loss or tracing thereof, or failing or refusing to honor proper claims for loss of or damage to baggage or other property.
              (n) Misrepresentation as to the requirements that must be met by persons or organizations in order to qualify for charter or group fare flights.
              (o)-(r) [Reserved]
              (s) Failing to disclose and offer Web-based discount fares on or after June 10, 2014, to prospective passengers who contact the agent through other channels (e.g., by telephone or in the agent's place of business) and indicate they are unable to use the agent's Web site due to a disability.

              § 399.81
              Unrealistic or deceptive scheduling.
              (a) The unrealistic scheduling of flights by any air carrier providing scheduled passenger air transportation is an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.
              (b) With respect to the advertising of schedule performance, it is an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition to use any figures purporting to reflect schedule or on-time performance without indicating the basis of the calculation, the time period involved, and the pairs of points or the percentage of system-wide operations thereby represented and whether the figures include all scheduled flights or only scheduled flights actually performed.
              (c) Chronically delayed flights. (1) This section applies to any air carrier that is a “reporting carrier” as defined in Part 234 of Department regulations (14 CFR Part 234).
              (2) For the purposes of this section, a chronically delayed flight means any domestic flight that is operated at least 10 times a month, and arrives more than 30 minutes late (including cancelled flights) more than 50 percent of the time during that month.
              (3) For purposes of this paragraph, the Department considers all of a carrier's flights that are operated in a given city-pair market whose scheduled departure times are within 30 minutes of the most frequently occurring scheduled departure time to be one single flight.
              (4) The holding out of a chronically delayed flight for more than four consecutive one-month periods represents one form of unrealistic scheduling and is an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.

              § 399.82
              Passing off of carrier identity by affiliation between carriers.
              (a) Applicability. This policy shall apply to proceedings in which the Board, in exercising its regulatory powers with respect to air carriers and foreign air carriers, is required to determine whether carriers have engaged in unfair or deceptive practices, or unfair methods of competition. The standards herein shall not be construed to supersede any action previously taken by the Board in a particular proceeding dealing with the subject matter of this statement, but to the extent not inconsistent therewith shall provide standards which supplement, or implement such specific Board action. The limitation of this policy statement to certain affiliated carriers should not be construed as an indication that the Board will permit other carriers to pass off by means of activities which are inconsistent with the minimum safeguards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. In such cases the Board may determine in an adjudicatory proceeding that the activities engaged in have a tendency to pass off and constitute an unfair or deceptive practice or an unfair method of competition.
              (b) Definition. For the purpose of this statement, the term affiliation, as between an air carrier and a foreign air carrier, shall mean that one of the carriers directly or indirectly has one of the following relationships to the other:
              (1) Owns or controls 10 percent or more of the securities of the other, with or without an accompanying power to vote;
              (2) Is in control of the other within the meaning of section 408 of the Act;
              (3) Has any of the interlocking relationships described in section 409 of the Act;
              (4) Is jointly controlled with the other carrier, directly or indirectly by a third person;

              (5) Provides general agency services for the other carrier.
              
              For the purpose of this statement, general agency services shall mean services performed under an agreement between an air carrier and a foreign air carrier which provides for the general representation of one by the other in a specified area or point, in relation to services such as the following: Solicitation and sale of passenger, express, and cargo transportation; airport transportation and hotel accommodations; local advertising and publicity, local sales offices; passenger services; local government representation; purchase, lease or other acquisition of equipment; or aircraft and transit services, aircraft inspection, aircraft dispatch.
              (c) Minimum safeguards. The minimum safeguards which the Board will consider as adequate to foreclose passing off by affiliated carriers are as follows:
              (1) An air carrier and any affiliated foreign air carrier shall not engage in joint public relations activities at points served by both carriers which tend to pass off the services of one carrier as the services of the other carrier or as part of a unified system of which each is a part;
              (2) Where one affiliated carrier provides general agency services for the other carrier, at points served by both carriers, it shall specifically identify all flights of the other carrier as flights of that carrier without reference to any relationship to the carrier performing the agency services;
              (3) All forms of display (including aircraft insignia), scheduled publications, advertising, or printed matter employed by affiliated carriers shall not state or imply that the services of either carrier are performed in common with the other carrier or as part of a single system. In cases where it is necessary to indicate that any agency service is performed by one affiliated carrier for the other, the references to the carrier performing the agency should be sufficiently subordinated to the name of the other carrier as to emphasize the limited role of the agent;
              (4) Telephone facilities at points served by both carriers should preserve the identity of the individual carriers;
              (5) Where joint traffic or sales facilities are maintained by affiliated carriers, the separate identity of each carrier should be maintained by reasonably comparable use of display advertising, desk-space, personnel uniforms, and other facilities and activities;
              (6) Where one carrier sells time payment tickets for travel over the other carrier (except interline travel), the application form should identify the carrier performing the transportation;
              (7) The respective personnel of the affiliated carriers shall preserve the individual identity of the respective carriers in all public dealings.
              (d) Unfair and deceptive practice. It is the policy of the Board to regard any joint activity of an affiliated air carrier and a foreign air carrier as an unfair or deceptive practice or unfair method of competition where such joint activity does not satisfy the minimum safeguards enumerated in the preceding subsection.
              (e) Exceptions. Exceptions to a safeguard set forth in paragraph (c) of this section may be recognized for activities in a foreign country if the Board finds that special circumstances pertaining to the country render the safeguard inappropriate. Exceptions on other grounds may be recognized pursuant to § 399.4.

              Unfair or deceptive practice of air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent in orally confirming to prospective passenger reserved space on scheduled flights.
              It is the policy of the Board to consider the practice of an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent, of stating to a prospective passenger by telephone or other means of communication that a reservation of space on a scheduled flight in air transportation is confirmed before a passenger has received a ticket specifying thereon his confirmed reserved space, to be an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition in air transportation or the sale thereof within the meaning of section 411 of the Act, unless the tariff of the particular air carrier or foreign air carrier provides for confirmation of reserved space by the means so used.

              § 399.84
              Price advertising and opt-out provisions.

              (a) The Department considers any advertising or solicitation by a direct air carrier, indirect air carrier, an agent of either, or a ticket agent, for passenger air transportation, a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations) or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation that states a price for such air transportation, tour, or tour component to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712, unless the price stated is the entire price to be paid by the customer to the carrier, or agent, for such air transportation, tour, or tour component. Although charges included within the single total price listed (e.g., government taxes) may be stated separately or through links or “pop ups” on websites that display the total price, such charges may not be false or misleading, may not be displayed prominently, may not be presented in the same or larger size as the total price, and must provide cost information on a per passenger basis that accurately reflects the cost of the item covered by the charge.
              (b) The Department considers any advertising by the entities listed in paragraph (a) of this section of an each-way airfare that is available only when purchased for round-trip travel to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712, unless such airfare is advertised as “each way” and in such a manner so that the disclosure of the round-trip purchase requirement is clearly and conspicuously noted in the advertisement and is stated prominently and proximately to the each-way fare amount. The Department considers it to be an unfair and deceptive practice to advertise each-way fares contingent on a round-trip purchase requirement as “one-way” fares, even if accompanied by prominent and proximate disclosure of the round trip purchase requirement.

              (c) When offering a ticket for purchase by a consumer, for passenger air transportation or for a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations) or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation, a direct air carrier, indirect air carrier, an agent of either, or a ticket agent, may not offer additional optional services in connection with air transportation, a tour, or tour component whereby the optional service is automatically added to the consumer's purchase if the consumer takes no other action, i.e., if the consumer does not opt out. The consumer must affirmatively “opt in” (i.e., agree) to such a service and the fee for it before that fee is added to the total price for the air transportation-related purchase. The Department considers the use of “opt-out” provisions to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712.

              § 399.85
              Notice of baggage fees and other fees.

              (a) If a U. S. or foreign air carrier has a website accessible for ticket purchases by the general public in the U.S., the carrier must promptly and prominently disclose any increase in its fee for carry-on or first and second checked bags and any change in the first and second checked bags or carry-on allowance for a passenger on the homepage of that website (e.g., provide a link that says “changed bag rules” or similarly descriptive language and takes the consumer from the homepage directly to a pop-up or a place on another webpage that details the change in baggage allowance or fees and the effective dates of such changes). Such notice must remain on the homepage for at least three months after the change becomes effective.
              (b) If a U.S. carrier, a foreign air carrier, an agent of either, or a ticket agent has a website accessible for ticket purchases by the general public in the U.S., the carrier or agent must clearly and prominently disclose on the first screen in which the agent or carrier offers a fare quotation for a specific itinerary selected by a consumer that additional airline fees for baggage may apply and where consumers can see these baggage fees. An agent may refer consumers to the airline websites where specific baggage fee information may be obtained or to its own site if it displays airlines' baggage fees.
              (c) On all e-ticket confirmations for air transportation within, to or from the United States, including the summary page at the completion of an online purchase and a post-purchase email confirmation, a U.S. carrier, a foreign air carrier, an agent of either, or a ticket agent that advertises or sells air transportation in the United States must include information regarding the passenger's free baggage allowance and/or the applicable fee for a carry-on bag and the first and second checked bag. Carriers must provide this information in text form in the e-ticket confirmation. Agents may provide this information in text form in the e-ticket confirmations or through a hyperlink to the specific location on airline websites or their own website where this information is displayed. The fee information provided for a carry-on bag and the first and second checked bag must be expressed as specific charges taking into account any factors (e.g., frequent flyer status, early purchase, and so forth) that affect those charges.
              (d) If a U.S. or foreign air carrier has a website marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation, the carrier must prominently disclose on its website information on fees for all optional services that are available to a passenger purchasing air transportation. Such disclosure must be clear, with a conspicuous link from the carrier's homepage directly to a page or a place on a page where all such optional services and related fees are disclosed. For purposes of this section, the term “optional services” is defined as any service the airline provides, for a fee, beyond passenger air transportation. Such fees include, but are not limited to, charges for checked or carry-on baggage, advance seat selection, in-flight beverages, snacks and meals, pillows and blankets and seat upgrades. In general, fees for particular services may be expressed as a range; however, baggage fees must be expressed as specific charges taking into account any factors (e.g., frequent flyer status, early purchase, and so forth) that affect those charges.
              (e) For air transportation within, to or from the United States, a carrier marketing a flight under its identity that is operated by a different carrier, otherwise known as a code-share flight, must through its website disclose to consumers booked on a code-share flight any differences between its optional services and related fees and those of the carrier operating the flight. This disclosure may be made through a conspicuous notice of the existence of such differences on the marketing carrier's website or a conspicuous hyperlink taking the reader directly to the operating carrier's fee listing or to a page on the marketing carrier's website that lists the differences in policies among code-share partners.
              (f) The Department considers the failure to give the appropriate notice described in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section to be an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.

              Payments for non-air transportation services for air cargo.
              The Board considers that payments by air carriers and foreign air carriers to shippers, indirect air carriers, or foreign indirect air carriers for non-air transportation preparation of air cargo shipments are for services ancillary to the air transportation, and are not prohibited under section 403 of the Act.

              For passengers whose ultimate ticketed origin or destination is a U.S. point, U.S. and foreign carriers must apply the baggage allowances and fees that apply at the beginning of a passenger's itinerary throughout his or her entire itinerary. In the case of code-share flights that form part of an itinerary whose ultimate ticketed origin or destination is a U.S. point, U.S. and foreign carriers must apply the baggage allowances and fees of the marketing carrier throughout the itinerary to the extent that they differ from those of any operating carrier.

              § 399.88
              Prohibition on post-purchase price increase.

              (a) It is an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712 for any seller of scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States, or of a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations), or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that includes scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States, to increase the price of that air transportation, tour or tour component to a consumer, including but not limited to an increase in the price of the seat, an increase in the price for the carriage of passenger baggage, or an increase in an applicable fuel surcharge, after the air transportation has been purchased by the consumer, except in the case of an increase in a government-imposed tax or fee. A purchase is deemed to have occurred when the full amount agreed upon has been paid by the consumer.

              (b) A seller of scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States or a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations), or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that includes scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States, must notify a consumer of the potential for a post-purchase price increase due to an increase in a government-imposed tax or fee and must obtain the consumer's written consent to the potential for such an increase prior to purchase of the scheduled air transportation, tour or tour component that includes scheduled air transportation. Imposition of any such increase without providing the consumer the appropriate notice and without obtaining his or her written consent of the potential increase constitutes an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.

Imposition of any such increase without providing the consumer the appropriate notice and obtaining his or her written consent to the potential increase constitutes an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.

              § 399.91
              Air carrier participation in programs of technical assistance to airlines of less developed countries.
              (a) Applicability. This policy shall apply to proceedings under sections 408, 409, and 412 of the Act in which the Board is required to make any determination as to the public interest or consistency with the Act of any agreement or relationship sought to be entered into by an air carrier, or officer or director thereof, with a foreign airline in connection with the performance of some activity pursuant to a technical assistance contract financed by an agency of the U.S. Government.
              (b) Policy. It is the policy of the Board that all U.S. air carriers interested in performing contracts for aviation technical assistance to foreign airlines should have equal access to information necessary to bid on such contracts, and should be given equal consideration thereafter in the award of such contracts based upon customary contracting criteria and subject to the considerations set forth below:
              (1) The air carrier selected should possess the necessary technical and managerial skills and economic strength to perform the assigned task in the recipient country to the credit of the United States. Where familiarity with the particular language and culture of the recipient country are important to the success of the project, weight should be given to the capabilities of all interested carriers in this regard, including particularly those which a route carrier may have acquired through service to the country or area.
              (2) Where a single U.S. route carrier is serving or is certificated to serve the recipient country or the region in which it is located, and where initiation or continued operation of the route by such carrier is an important national interest objective of the United States, weight should be given to any evidence that an award of the contract to the route carrier as opposed to any other U.S. carrier would be held to achieve this objective.
              (3) An air carrier performing a technical assistance contract will necessarily occupy a close special relationship with the airline and government of the recipient country. Over and above the terms of any specific contract, there is latent in such relationship the possibility of a relative preference for such carrier over a competing U.S. air carrier in matters of interline traffic, governmental restrictions, etc. Accordingly, where more than one U.S. route carrier is certificated to serve the recipient country and more than one such carrier wishes to perform the technical assistance, none of such carriers should be awarded the contract over the objection of any other except under very unusual circumstances.
              (4) Technical assistance contracts should contain realistic objectives and require competent performance at reasonable cost and within a reasonable period of time consistent with the ability of the foreign airline to become self-sufficient.
              (5) Technical assistance contracts should not be awarded to a U.S. route carrier with major economic interests hostile to those of the U.S. route carrier serving the country.

              (6) Technical assistance contracts should not be awarded to subsidized carriers except under special circumstances. Such circumstances should include at least a showing (i) that the subsidized carrier has special qualifications, the utilization of which is required in the national interest by the circumstances of a particular program, and (ii) that performance of the contract will not interfere with the primary business of the subsidized carrier which is to provide air transportation in the United States. In the latter connection, it is to be recognized that participation with maximum effectiveness in a technical assistance program would not only divert the attention of top management from certificated services but might also involve the assignment of the most competent senior operational and technical personnel, the diversion of funds at least on a short-term basis, and the possible transfer from certificated services of aircraft and related equipment. Normally, therefore, unless substantial evidence and arguments are produced to the contrary, participation by subsidized carriers in technical assistance programs will be considered inconsistent with the public interest.

              (a) By Executive Order 11920, 41 FR 23665 (June 11, 1976), effective July 11, 1976, the President has authorized the issuance for public inspection of decisions by the Board in cases where the action of the Board is subject to the review or approval of the President in accordance with section 801 of the Federal Aviation Act. In the interest of national security, and in order to allow for consideration of appropriate action under Executive Order 11652, Executive Order 11920 provides that decisions shall be withheld from public disclosure for five days after submission to the President but may be released on or after the sixth day following receipt by the President as to all unclassified portions of the text if the Board is not notified by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or his designee that all or part of the decision shall be withheld from public disclosure.
              (b) It is the policy of the Board to release to the public all decisions by the Board in section 801 cases as promptly as possible following submission of such decision to the President. Upon receipt of notice by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs as required by the Executive Order, the Board shall promptly provide one copy for public inspection in the Docket Section and one copy for public inspection and copying in the Public Reference Room, and shall promptly thereafter print and process the decision for more general distribution in accordance with Board procedures. Where the Board is required to withhold portions of the text of its decision it shall make public those portions of its decision which may be publicly released. Where the Board is required to withhold public release of its decision in its entirety it shall nonetheless publicly indicate that its decision has been transmitted to the President. The Board shall not publicly indicate that its decision has been transmitted to the President in those cases in which the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or his designee determines that classification of the existence of the decision is appropriate and so informs the Board. The provisions are also applicable to decisions submitted to the President for review pursuant to section 801(b) of the Act.

            § 404.3
            General.
            (a) Any person may petition the Associate Administrator to:
            (1) Issue, amend, or repeal a regulation to eliminate as a requirement for a license or permit any requirement of Federal law applicable to commercial space launch and reentry activities and the operation of launch and reentry sites;
            (2) Waive any such requirement in the context of a specific application for a license or permit; or
            (3) Waive the requirement for a license, except as provided in § 404.7(b).
            (b) A petition filed under this section may request, under § 413.9 of this chapter, that the Associate Administrator withhold certain trade secrets or proprietary commercial or financial data from public disclosure.
            (c) Each petitioner filing under this section must:

            (1) For electronic submission, send one copy of the petition by email to the Office of Commercial Space Transportation at ASTpetition@faa.gov; or
            (2) For paper submission, send one copy of the petition to the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW, Room 331, Washington, DC 20591.
            (d) Each petition filed under this section must include the petitioner's name, mailing address, telephone number and any other contact information, such as an email address or a fax number.
            (e) Notification. When the Associate Administrator determines that a petition should be granted or denied, the Associate Administrator notifies the petitioner of the Associate Administrator's action and the reasons supporting the action.
            (f) Reconsideration. Any person may petition the FAA to reconsider a denial of a petition the person filed. The petitioner must send a request for reconsideration within 60 days after being notified of the denial to the same address to which the original petition was filed. For the FAA to accept the reconsideration request, the petitioner must show—
            (1) There is a significant additional fact and the reason it was not included in the original petition;
            (2) The FAA made an important factual error in its denial of the original petition; or
            (3) The denial is not in accordance with the applicable law and regulations.
            (g) Public hearing. No public hearing, argument or other proceeding is held on a petition before its disposition under this section.

            Filing a petition for waiver.

            A petition for waiver must be submitted at least 60 days before the proposed effective date of the waiver unless the petitioner shows good cause for later submission in the petition, and the petition for waiver must—
            
            (a) Include the specific section or sections of 14 CFR chapter III from which the petitioner seeks relief;
            (b) Include the extent of the relief sought and the reason the relief is being sought;
            (c) Include any facts, views, and data available to the petitioner to support the waiver request; and
            (d) Show why granting the request for relief is in the public interest and will not jeopardize the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.

            § 404.7
            Action on a petition for waiver.
            (a) Grant of waiver. The Associate Administrator may grant a waiver, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if the Associate Administrator determines that the waiver is in the public interest and will not jeopardize public health and safety, the safety of property, or any national security or foreign policy interest of the United States.
            (b) Waiver ineligibility. The FAA may not grant a waiver that would permit the launch or reentry of a launch vehicle or a reentry vehicle without a license or permit if a human being will be on board.
            (c) Denial of waiver. If the Associate Administrator determines that the petition does not justify granting a waiver, the Associate Administrator denies the petition.

            Each licensee or permittee must allow access by and cooperate with Federal officers or employees or other individuals authorized by the Associate Administrator to observe licensed facilities and activities, including launch sites and reentry sites, as well as manufacturing, production, testing, and training facilities, or assembly sites used by any contractor, licensee, or permittee to produce, assemble, or test a launch or reentry vehicle and to integrate a payload with its launch or reentry vehicle. Observations are conducted to monitor the activities of the licensee, permittee, or contractor at such time and to such extent as the Associate Administrator considers reasonable and necessary to determine compliance with the license or permit or to perform the Associate Administrator's responsibilities pertaining to payloads for which no Federal license, authorization, or permit is required.

            Authority to modify, suspend or revoke.
            (a) The FAA may modify a license or permit issued under this chapter upon application by the licensee or permittee or upon the FAA's own initiative, if the FAA finds that the modification is consistent with the requirements of the Act.
            (b) The FAA may suspend or revoke any license or permit issued to such licensee or permittee under this chapter if the FAA finds that a licensee or permittee has substantially failed to comply with any requirement of the Act, any regulation issued under the Act, the terms and conditions of a license or permit, or any other applicable requirement; or that public health and safety, the safety of property, or any national security or foreign policy interest of the United States so require.
            (c) Unless otherwise specified by the Office, any modification, suspension or revocation made by the Office under this section:
            (1) Takes effect immediately; and
            (2) Continues in effect during any review of such action under Part 406 of this chapter.

A civil penalty action is initiated when the agency attorney advises a person, referred to as the respondent, of the charges or other reasons upon which the FAA bases the proposed action and allows the respondent to answer the charges and to be heard as to why the civil penalty should not be imposed. A notice of proposed civil penalty states the facts alleged; any requirement of the Act, a regulation issued under the Act, or any term or condition of a license or permit issued or transferred under the Act allegedly violated by the respondent; and the amount of the proposed civil penalty. Not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice of proposed civil penalty the respondent may elect to proceed by one or more of the following:
              (1) Pay the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed upon amount, in which case the agency attorney will issue either an order imposing civil penalty or a compromise order in that amount.
              (2) Submit to the agency attorney one of the following:
              (i) Written information, including documents and witnesses statements, demonstrating that a violation did not occur or that a penalty, or the amount of the proposed penalty, is not warranted by the circumstances.
              (ii) A written request to reduce the proposed civil penalty, the amount of reduction, and the reasons and any document supporting a reduction of the proposed civil penalty, including records indicating a financial inability to pay or records showing that payment of the proposed civil penalty would prevent the person from continuing in business.
              (iii) A written request for an informal conference to discuss the matter with the agency attorney and to submit relevant information.
              (3) Request that a final notice of proposed civil penalty be issued so that the respondent may request a hearing in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
              (d) Final notice of proposed civil penalty. A final notice of proposed civil penalty (final notice) provides the last opportunity for the respondent to request a hearing.
              (1) The agency attorney issues a final notice if one of the following occurs:
              (i) The respondent fails to respond to the notice of proposed civil penalty not later than 30 days after the date the respondent received the notice of proposed civil penalty.
              (ii) The parties have not agreed to a resolution of the action after participating in informal procedures under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (iii) The respondent requests the issuance of a final notice in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
              (2) Not later than 15 days after the date the respondent received the final notice of proposed civil penalty, the respondent shall do one of the following:
              (i) Submit the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed-upon amount, in which case the agency attorney issues either an order imposing civil penalty or a compromise order in that amount.
              (ii) Request a hearing in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
              (e) Order imposing civil penalty. An order imposing civil penalty is the final order of the Secretary imposing a civil penalty. An order imposing civil penalty is issued for a violation described in paragraph (a) of this section after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
              (1) The agency attorney either issues an order imposing civil penalty, or another document becomes an order imposing civil penalty, as described below.
              (i) The agency attorney issues an order imposing civil penalty if, in response to a notice of proposed civil penalty or a final notice of proposed civil penalty, the respondent pays or agrees to pay a civil penalty in the amount proposed or an agreed upon amount (other than an agreement for a compromise order under paragraph (f) of this section).
              (ii) Unless the respondent requests a hearing not later than 15 days after the date the respondent received a final notice of proposed civil penalty, the final notice of proposed civil penalty becomes an order imposing civil penalty.
              (iii) Unless an appeal is filed with the FAA decisionmaker in accordance with § 406.175, if the administrative law judge finds that a violation occurred and determines that a civil penalty, in an amount found appropriate by the administrative law judge, is warranted, an initial decision of an administrative law judge under subpart B of this part becomes an order imposing civil penalty.
              (iv) Unless a complaint is filed with a United States district court in accordance with § 406.176, if the FAA decisionmaker finds that a violation occurred and determines that a civil penalty, in an amount found appropriate by the FAA decisionmaker, is warranted, a final decision and order of the FAA decisionmaker under subpart B of this part becomes an order imposing civil penalty. If a person seeks judicial review not later than 60 days after the final decision and order has been served on the respondent, the final decision and order is stayed.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (f) Compromise order. The agency attorney at any time may agree to compromise any civil penalty with no finding of violation. Under such agreement, the agency attorney issues a compromise order stating:
              (1) The respondent agrees to pay a civil penalty.
              (2) The FAA makes no finding of a violation.
              (3) The compromise order may not be used as evidence of a prior violation in any subsequent civil penalty action, license, or permit action.
              (g) Request for hearing. Any respondent who has been issued a final notice of proposed civil penalty may, not later than 15 days after the date the respondent received the final notice, request a hearing under subpart B of this part.
              (1) The respondent must file a written request for hearing with the Federal Docket Management System (U.S. Department of Transportation, Docket Operations, West Building Ground Floor, Room W12-140, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590) and must serve a copy of the request on the agency attorney. Sections 406.113 and 406.115 state how filing and service must be done.
              (2) The request for hearing must be dated and signed.
              (h) Method of payment. A respondent must pay a civil penalty by check or money order, payable to the Federal Aviation Administration.
              (i) Collection of civil penalties. If a respondent does not pay a civil penalty imposed by an order imposing civil penalty or a compromise order within 60 days after service of the final order, the FAA may refer the order to the United States Department of Treasury or Department of Justice to collect the civil penalty.
              (j) Exhaustion of administrative remedies. A respondent may seek judicial review of a final decision and order of the FAA decisionmaker as provided in § 406.179. A respondent has not exhausted administrative remedies for purposes of judicial review if the final order is one of the following:
              (1) An order imposing civil penalty issued by an agency attorney under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
              (2) A final notice of proposed civil penalty that becomes an order imposing civil penalty under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (3) An initial decision of an administrative law judge that was not appealed to the FAA decisionmaker.

              (4) A compromise order under paragraph (f) of this section.
              
              (k) Compromise. The FAA may compromise or remit a civil penalty that has been proposed or imposed under this section.

(1) Documents filed in a civil penalty adjudication are kept in the Federal Docket Management System (FDMS), except for documents that contain confidential information in accordance with 406.117. The FDMS is an electronic docket. Documents that are filed are scanned into the electronic docket and an index is made of all documents that have been filed so that any person may view the index and documents as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (2) A party is not required to file written interrogatories and responses, requests for production of documents or tangible items and responses, and requests for admission and responses with the Federal Docket Management System or submit them to administrative law judge, except as provided in 406.143.

A person must serve a copy of each document on each party in accordance with 406.115.
              (c) Date of filing. The date of filing is the date of personal delivery, or if mailed, the mailing date shown on any certificate of service, the date shown on the postmark if there is no certificate of service, or other mailing data shown by other evidence if there is no certificate of service or postmark. The date shown in the FDMS index is not necessarily the date of service. It is the date the FDMS received the document.
              (d) Form. FDMS scans the document into its electronic docket. To ensure that FDMS can scan the document and correctly identify it in the index, each person filing a document must comply with the following:

              (iii) FAA Case Number and FDMS docket number, if assigned.
              (iv) Name of the document being filed, including the party filing the document, such as “Respondent's Motion to Dismiss.”

              (v) “Confidential information filed with administrative law judge” or “Confidential information filed with Assistant Chief Counsel for Litigation” if the party is filing confidential information under 406.117.
              (3) The document must be capable of being scanned and be easy to read both in paper form and as scanned into the electronic docket. A document that meets the following specifications is capable of being scanned using automatic feeders and is easy to read both in paper form and as scanned into the electronic docket. Documents that do not meet these specifications may not be legible.
              (i) On white paper.
              (ii) On paper not larger than 81/2 by 11 inches.
              (iii) In black ink.

              (vi) Margins at least 1 inch on each side.
              (vii) The original not bound or hole-punched, only held together with removable metal clips or the like. The copy that is filed or sent to the administrative law judge or Assistant Chief Counsel for Litigation, and the copy served on another party, need not meet this specification.

              § 406.115
              Serving documents on other parties.
              (a) Service required. A person must serve on each other party at the time of filing a copy of any document filed with the Federal Docket Management System. Service on a party's attorney or representative of record is adequate service on the party.
              (b) Method of service. A person must serve documents by personal delivery or by mail.
              (c) Certificate of service. A person may attach a certificate of service to a document filed with the FDMS. Any certificate of service must include a statement, dated and signed by the individual filing the document, that the document was served on each party, the method of service, and the date of service.
              (d) Date of service. The date of service is the date of personal delivery; or if mailed, the mailing date shown on the certificate of service, the date shown on the postmark if there is no certificate of service, or other mailing date shown by other evidence if there is no certificate of service or postmark. The date shown in the FDMS index is not necessarily the date of service. It is the date the FDMS received the document.
              (e) Additional time after service by mail. Whenever a party has a right or a duty to act or to make any response within a prescribed period after service by mail, or on a specified date after service by mail, 5 days is added to the prescribed period.
              (f) Service by the administrative law judge. The administrative law judge must serve a copy of each document including, but not limited to, notices of pre-hearing conferences and hearings, rulings on motions, decisions, and orders, upon each party to the proceedings by personal delivery or by mail.
              (g) Service made. A document is deemed served in accordance with this subpart if it was properly addressed; was sent in accordance with this subpart; and was returned, not claimed, or refused. Service is considered valid as of the date and the time that the document was mailed, or personal delivery of the document was refused.
              (h) Presumption of service. There is a presumption of service where a party or a person, who customarily receives mail, or receives it in the ordinary course of business, at either the person's residence or the person's principal place of business, acknowledges receipt of the document.
              [Doc. No. FAA-2001-8607, 66 FR 2180, Jan. 10, 2001, as amended at 72 FR 68476, Dec. 5, 2007]

              (1) Place the information in a separate sealed envelope and clearly mark the envelope “CONFIDENTIAL.” At least the first page of the document in the envelope also must be marked “CONFIDENTIAL.”
              (2) Attach to this envelope a cover document marked “Confidential information filed with administrative law judge” or “Confidential information filed with Assistant Chief Counsel for Litigation.” The cover document must include, at the least, a short statement of what is being filed, such as “Respondent's motion for confidentiality order.”
              (3) Unless such a motion has already been granted, enclose a motion for confidentiality order in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The motion must be in the sealed envelope if it contains confidential information; otherwise the motion must be outside of the sealed envelope.
              (b) Marked information not made public. If a party files a document in a sealed envelope clearly marked “CONFIDENTIAL” the document may not be made available to the public unless and until the administrative law judge or the FAA decisionmaker decides it may be made available to the public in accordance with 51 U.S.C. 50916.
              (c) Motion for confidentiality order. If a party is filing, is requested to provide in discovery, or intends to offer at the hearing, information that the party does not wish to be available to the public, the party must file a motion for a confidentiality order.
              (1) The party must state the specific grounds for withholding the information from the public.
              (2) If the party claims that the information is protected under 51 U.S.C. 50916, and if both the complainant and the respondent agree that the information is protected under that section, the administrative law judge must grant the motion. If one party does not agree that the information is protected under 51 U.S.C. 50916 the administrative law judge must decide. Either party may file an interlocutory appeal of right under § 406.173(c).
              (3) If the party claims that the information should be protected on grounds other than those provided by 51 U.S.C. 50916 the administrative law judge must grant the motion if, based on the motion and any response to the motion, the administrative law judge determines that disclosure would be detrimental to safety, disclosure would not be in the public interest, or that the information is not otherwise required to be made available to the public.
              (4) If the administrative law judge determines that the information is not necessary to decide the case or would not otherwise lead to the discovery of relevant material, the administrative law judge must preclude any inquiry into the matter by any party.
              (5) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested material may be disclosed during discovery, the administrative law judge may order that the material may be discovered and disclosed under limited conditions or may be used only under certain terms and conditions.
              (6) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested material is necessary to decide the case, or would otherwise lead to the discovery of relevant material, and that a confidentiality order is warranted, the administrative law judge must—
              (i) Provide an opportunity for review of the document by the attorneys of record off the record.

              (ii) Provide procedures for excluding the information from the record, or order that portion of the record that includes confidential information be closed.
              (iii) Order that the parties must not disclose the information in any manner and the parties must not use the information in any other proceeding.
              (7) If an administrative law judge orders a record closed, in whole or in part:
              (i) The closed record is not available to the public.
              (ii) The closed record is available to the parties' attorneys of record.
              (iii) The administrative law judge may determine whether the closed record is available to the parties, the parties' representatives, or other persons such as witnesses for a party.
              (iv) No party, attorney of record, representative of record, or person who receives information from such persons, may disclose information that has been protected under this section except to a person authorized by this section or the administrative law judge to receive it.
              (v) If a person other than one authorized by this section desires to view or copy a closed record, the person must file a motion to open the record.

              Computation of time.
              (a) This section applies to any period of time prescribed or allowed by this subpart, by notice or order of the administrative law judge or the FAA decisionmaker, or by any applicable statute.
              (b) The date of an act, event, or default, after which a designated time period begins to run, is not included in a computation of time under this subpart.
              (c) The last day of a time period is included in a computation of time unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday. If the last day of the time period is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the time period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

              Before an appeal is filed with the FAA decisionmaker, the parties may seek an extension of time as follows:
              (a) Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may agree to extend for a reasonable period of time for filing a document under this subpart with the agreement of the administrative law judge. The party seeking the extension of time must submit a draft order to the administrative law judge for signature, file it with the Federal Docket Management System, and serve it on each party.
              (b) Motion for extension of time. If the parties do not agree to an extension of time for filing a document, a party desiring an extension may file with the Federal Docket Management System and serve a written motion for an extension of time not later than 7 days before the document is due unless good cause for the late filing is shown. The administrative law judge may grant the extension of time if good cause for the extension is shown.
              (c) Failure to rule. If the administrative law judge fails to rule on a written motion for an extension of time by the date the document is due, the motion for an extension of time is granted for no more than 20 days after the original date the document was to be filed.

The respondent must admit, deny, or state that the respondent is without sufficient knowledge or information to admit or deny, each numbered paragraph of the complaint. Any statement or allegation contained in the complaint that is not specifically denied in the answer constitutes an admission of the truth of that allegation.

              (ii) Affirmative defenses. The answer must specifically state any affirmative defense that the respondent asserts.
              (iii) Request for relief. The answer may include a brief statement of any relief requested.

              (e) Disputes. The administrative law judge must resolve any dispute regarding discovery or regarding compliance with the joint schedule as soon as possible so that the parties may continue to comply with the joint schedule.
              (f) Sanctions for failure to comply with joint schedule. If a party fails to comply with the order establishing a joint schedule, the administrative law judge may direct that party to comply with a motion to compel discovery; or, limited to the extent of the party's failure to comply with a motion or discovery request, the administrative law judge may:
              (1) Strike that portion of a party's pleadings;

              § 406.141
              Motions.
              (a) General. A party applying for an order or ruling not specifically provided in this subpart must do so by motion. A party must comply with the requirements of this section when filing a motion for consideration by the administrative law judge or the FAA decisionmaker on appeal.
              (b) Contents. A party must state the relief sought by the motion and the particular grounds supporting that relief. If a party has evidence in support of a motion, the party must attach any evidence, including affidavits, to the motion.
              (c) Form and time. Except for oral motions heard on the record, a motion made prior to the hearing must be in writing. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or for good cause shown, a party must file any prehearing motion with the Federal Docket Management System and serve each other party not later than 30 days before the hearing.
              (d) Answers to motions. Any party may file and serve an answer, with affidavits or other evidence in support of the answer, not later than 10 days after service of a written motion on that party. When a motion is made during a hearing, the answer may be made at the hearing on the record, orally or in writing, within a reasonable time determined by the administrative law judge.
              (e) Rulings on motions. The administrative law judge must rule on all motions as follows:
              (1) Discovery motions. The administrative law judge must resolve all pending discovery motions not later than 10 days before the hearing.
              (2) Prehearing motions. The administrative law judge must resolve all pending prehearing motions not later than 7 days before the hearing. If the administrative law judge issues a ruling or order orally, the administrative law judge must serve a written copy of the ruling or order, within 3 days, on each party. In all other cases, the administrative law judge must issue rulings and orders in writing and must serve a copy of the ruling or order on each party.
              (3) Motions made during the hearing. The administrative law judge may issue rulings and orders on motions made during the hearing orally. Oral rulings or orders on motions must be made on the record.
              (f) Specific motions—(1) Complainant's motion to dismiss a request for a hearing as prematurely filed. The complainant may file a motion to dismiss a request for a hearing as prematurely filed instead of filing a complaint. If the motion is not granted, the complainant must file the complaint and must serve a copy of the complaint on each party not later than 10 days after service of the administrative law judge's ruling or order on the motion to dismiss. If the motion to dismiss is granted and the proceedings are terminated without a hearing, the respondent may file an appeal in accordance with § 406.175. If required by the decision on appeal, the complainant must file a complaint and must serve a copy of the complaint on each party not later than 10 days after service of the decision on appeal.
              (2) Respondent's motions instead of an answer. A respondent may file one or more of the following motions instead of filing an answer. If the administrative law judge denies the motion, the respondent must file an answer not later than 10 days after service of the denial of the motion.
              (i) Respondent's motion to dismiss complaint for failure to state a claim for which a civil penalty may be imposed. A respondent may file a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for which a civil penalty may be imposed instead of filing an answer. The motion must show that the complaint fails to state a violation of the Act, a regulation issued under the Act, or any term or condition of a license issued or transferred under the Act.
              (ii) Respondent's motion to dismiss allegations or complaint for staleness. Instead of filing an answer to the complaint, a respondent may move to dismiss the complaint, or that part of the complaint that alleges a violation that occurred more than 5 years before an agency attorney issued a notice of proposed civil penalty to the respondent, as provided by 28 U.S.C. 2462.
              (iii) Respondent's motion for more definite statement. A respondent may file a motion requesting a more definite statement of the allegations contained in the complaint instead of filing an answer. The respondent must set forth, in detail, the indefinite or uncertain allegations contained in a complaint or response to any pleading and must submit the details that the party believes would make the allegation or response definite and certain. If the administrative law judge grants the motion, the complainant must supply a more definite statement not later than 15 days after service of the ruling granting the motion. If the complainant fails to supply a more definite statement, the administrative law judge must strike the allegations in the complaint to which the motion is directed. If the administrative law judge denies the motion, the respondent must file an answer and must serve a copy of the answer on each party not later than 10 days after service of the order of denial.
              (3) Other motions to dismiss. A party may file a motion to dismiss, specifying the grounds for dismissal.
              (4) Complainant's motion for more definite statement. The complainant may file a motion requesting a more definite statement if an answer fails to respond clearly to the allegations in the complaint. The complainant must set forth, in detail, the indefinite or uncertain allegations contained in the answer and must submit the details that the complainant believes would make the allegation or response definite and certain. If the administrative law judge grants the motion, the respondent must supply a more definite statement not later than 15 days after service of the ruling on the motion. If the respondent fails to supply a more definite statement, the administrative law judge must strike those statements in the answer to which the motion is directed. An administrative law judge shall treat a respondent's failure to supply a more definite statement as an admission of unanswered allegations in the complaint.
              (5) Other motions for more definite statement. A party may file a motion for more definite statement of any pleading that requires or permits a response under this subpart. A party must set forth, in detail, each indefinite or uncertain allegation contained in a pleading or response and must submit the details that would make each allegation definite and certain.
              (6) Motion to strike. Any party may make a motion to strike any insufficient allegation or defense, or any redundant, immaterial, or irrelevant matter in a pleading. A party must file a motion to strike and must serve a copy on each party before a response to that pleading is required under this subpart or, if a response is not required, not later than 10 days after service of the pleading.
              (7) Motion for decision. A party may make a motion for decision, regarding all or any part of the proceedings, at any time before the administrative law judge has issued an initial decision in the proceedings. The administrative law judge must grant a party's motion for decision if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, matters that the administrative law judge has officially noticed, or evidence introduced during the hearing show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the party making the motion is entitled to a decision as a matter of law. The party making the motion for decision has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact disputed by the parties.
              (8) Motion for disqualification. A party may file a motion for disqualification. A party may file the motion at any time after the administrative law judge has been assigned to the proceedings but must make the motion before the administrative law judge files an initial decision in the proceedings.
              (i) Motion and supporting affidavit. A party must state the grounds for disqualification, including, but not limited to, personal bias, pecuniary interest, or other factors showing reason for disqualification, in the motion for disqualification. A party must submit an affidavit with the motion for disqualification that sets forth, in detail, the matters alleged to constitute grounds for disqualification.
              (ii) Answer. A party may respond to the motion for disqualification not later than 5 days after service of the motion for disqualification.
              (iii) Decision on motion for disqualification. The administrative law judge must issue a decision on the motion for disqualification not later than 15 days after the motion has been filed. If the administrative law judge finds that the motion for disqualification and supporting affidavit show a basis for disqualification, the administrative law judge must withdraw from the proceedings immediately. If the administrative law judge finds that disqualification is not warranted, the administrative law judge must deny the motion and state the grounds for the denial on the record. If the administrative law judge fails to rule on a party's motion for disqualification within 15 days after the motion has been filed, the motion is granted.

              § 406.143
              Discovery.
              (a) Initiation of discovery. Any party may initiate discovery described in this section, without the consent or approval of the administrative law judge, at any time after a complaint has been filed.
              (b) Methods of discovery. The following methods of discovery are permitted under this section: depositions on oral examination or written questions of any person; written interrogatories directed to a party; requests for production of documents or tangible items to any person; and requests for admission by a party. A party is not required to file written interrogatories and responses, requests for production of documents or tangible items and responses, and requests for admission and responses with the Federal Docket Management System or submit any of them to the administrative law judge. In the event of a discovery dispute, a party must attach a copy of these documents in support of a motion filed under this section.
              (c) Service on the agency. A party must serve each discovery request directed to the agency or any agency employee with the agency attorney.
              (d) Time for response to discovery request. Unless otherwise directed by this subpart or agreed by the parties, a party must respond to a request for discovery, including filing objections to a request for discovery, not later than 30 days after service of the request.
              (e) Scope of discovery. Subject to the limits on discovery set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, a party may discover any matter that is not privileged and that is relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding. A party may discover information that relates to the claim or defense of any party including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any document or other tangible item and the identity and location of any person having knowledge of discoverable matter. A party may discover facts known, or opinions held, by an expert who any other party expects to call to testify at the hearing. A party has no ground to object to a discovery request on the basis that the information sought would not be admissible at the hearing if the information sought during discovery is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
              (f) Limiting discovery. The administrative law judge must limit the frequency and extent of discovery permitted by this section if a party shows that—
              (1) The information requested is cumulative or repetitious;
              (2) The information requested can be obtained from another less burdensome and more convenient source;
              (3) The party requesting the information has had ample opportunity to obtain the information through other discovery methods permitted under this section; or
              (4) The method or scope of discovery requested by the party is unduly burdensome or expensive.
              (g) Confidentiality order. A party or person who has received a discovery request for information that is related to a trade secret, confidential or sensitive material, competitive or commercial information, proprietary data, or information on research and development, may file and serve a motion for a confidentiality order in accordance with § 406.117.
              (h) Protective order. A party or a person who has received a request for discovery may file a motion for protective order and must serve a copy of the motion for protective order on each party. The party or person making the motion must show that the protective order is necessary to protect the party or the person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. As part of the protective order, the administrative law judge may:
              (1) Deny the discovery request;
              (2) Order that discovery be conducted only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place for discovery or a determination of the method of discovery; or
              (3) Limit the scope of discovery or preclude any inquiry into certain matters during discovery.
              (i) Duty to supplement or amend response. A party who has responded to a discovery request has a duty to supplement or amend the response, as soon as the information is known, as follows:
              (1) A party must supplement or amend any response to a question requesting the identity and location of any person having knowledge of discoverable matters.

              (2) A party must supplement or amend any response to a question requesting the identity of each person who will be called to testify at the hearing as an expert witness and the subject matter and substance of that witness' testimony.
              (3) A party must supplement or amend any response that was incorrect when made or any response that was correct when made but is no longer correct, accurate, or complete.
              (j) Depositions. The following rules apply to all depositions taken pursuant to this section:
              (1) Form. A deposition must be taken on the record and reduced to writing. The person being deposed must sign the deposition unless the parties agree to waive the requirement of a signature.
              (2) Administration of oaths. Within the United States, or a territory or possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, a party must take a deposition before a person authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or authorized by the law of the place where the examination is held. In a foreign country, a party must take a deposition in any manner allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
              (3) Notice of deposition. A party must serve a notice of deposition, stating the time and place of the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined, on the person to be deposed, must submit the notice to the administrative law judge, and must file the notice with the Federal Docket Management System, and must serve the notice on each party, not later than 7 days before the deposition. A party may serve a notice of deposition less than 7 days before the deposition only with consent of the administrative law judge. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the person to be examined, the party must attach to the notice of deposition a copy of the subpoena duces tecum that describes the materials to be produced at the deposition.
              (4) Use of depositions. A party may use any part or all of a deposition at a hearing authorized under this subpart only upon a showing of good cause. The deposition may be used against any party who was present or represented at the deposition or who had reasonable notice of the deposition.
              (k) Interrogatories. (1) A party may not serve more than 30 interrogatories to each other party. Each subpart of an interrogatory must be counted as a separate interrogatory.
              (2) A party must file a motion for leave to serve more than 30 interrogatories on a party before serving additional interrogatories on a party. The administrative law judge must grant the motion only if the party shows good cause for the party's failure to inquire about the information previously and that the information cannot reasonably be obtained using less burdensome discovery methods or be obtained from other sources.
              (3) A party must answer each interrogatory separately and completely in writing.
              (4) A party, or the party's attorney or representative of record, must sign the party's responses to interrogatories.
              (5) If a party objects to an interrogatory, the party must state the objection and the reasons for the objection.
              (6) An opposing party may offer into evidence any part or all of a party's responses to interrogatories at a hearing under this subpart to the extent that the response is relevant, material, and not repetitious.
              (l) Requests for admission. A party may serve a written request for admission of the truth of any matter within the scope of discovery under this section or the authenticity of any document described in the request. A party must set forth each request for admission separately. A party must serve a copy of each document referenced in the request for admission unless the document has been provided or is reasonably available for inspection and copying.
              (1) Time. A party's failure to respond to a request for admission is not later than 30 days after service of the request constitutes an admission of the truth of the statement or statements contained in the request for admission. The administrative law judge may determine that a failure to respond to a request for admission does not constitute an admission of the truth if a party shows that the failure was due to circumstances beyond the control of the party or the party's attorney or representative.
              (2) Response. A party may object to a request for admission. The objection must be in writing and signed by the party or the party's attorney or representative of record, and must state the reasons for objection. A party may specifically deny the truth of the matter or describe the reasons why the party is unable to truthfully deny or admit the matter. If a party is unable to deny or admit the truth of the matter, the party must show that the party has made reasonable inquiry into the matter or that the information known to, or readily obtainable by, the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny the matter. A party may admit or deny any part of the request for admission. If an administrative law judge determines that a response does not comply with the requirements of this rule or that the response is insufficient, the matter is admitted.
              (3) Effect of admission. Any matter admitted or treated as admitted under this section is conclusively established for the purpose of the hearing and appeal.
              (m) Motion to compel discovery. A party may make a motion to compel discovery if a person refuses to answer a question during a deposition, a party fails or refuses to answer an interrogatory, a person gives an evasive or incomplete answer during a deposition or when responding to an interrogatory, or a party fails or refuses to produce documents or tangible items. During a deposition, the proponent of a question may complete the deposition or may adjourn the examination before making a motion to compel if a person refuses to answer.
              (n) Failure to comply with a discovery order or order to compel. If a party fails to comply with a discovery order or an order to compel, the administrative law judge, limited to the extent of the party's failure to comply with the discovery order or motion to compel, may:
              (1) Strike that portion of a party's pleadings;
              (2) Preclude prehearing or discovery motions by that party;
              (3) Preclude admission of that portion of a party's evidence at the hearing; or
              (4) Preclude that portion of the testimony of that party's witnesses at the hearing.

              § 406.147
              Notice of hearing.
              (a) Notice. The administrative law judge must give each party at least 60 days notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing.
              (b) Date, time, and location of the hearing. The administrative law judge must set a reasonable date, time, and location for the hearing within the United States. The administrative law judge must consider the need for discovery and any joint procedural or discovery schedule submitted by the parties when determining the hearing date. The administrative law judge must give due regard to the convenience of the parties, the location where the majority of the witnesses reside or work, and whether a scheduled air carrier serves the location.
              (c) Earlier hearing. With the consent of the administrative law judge, the parties may agree to hold the hearing on an earlier date than the date specified in the notice of hearing.
              (d) Space hearing consolidated with aviation hearing under 14 CFR part 13 subpart G. With the consent of the administrative law judge, the parties may agree to hold the hearing, or parts of the hearing, together with a hearing under 14 CFR part 13 subpart G if the cases involve some common issues of fact. If the hearings are consolidated, the administrative law judge may issue a consolidated initial decision covering both cases. The Administrator will serve as the FAA decisionmaker on appeal for both cases and will issue a consolidated decision, with the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation serving as an advisor to the FAA decisionmaker.
            
            
              § 406.149
              Evidence.
              (a) General. A party is entitled to present the party's case or defense by oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct any cross-examination that may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
              
              (b) Admissibility. A party may introduce any oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence in support of the party's case or defense. The administrative law judge must admit any oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence introduced by a party but must exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.
              (c) Hearsay evidence. Hearsay evidence is admissible in proceedings governed by this subpart. The fact that evidence submitted by a party is hearsay goes only to the weight of the evidence and does not affect its admissibility.
            
            
              § 406.151
              Standard of proof.
              The administrative law judge must issue an initial decision or must rule in a party's favor only if the decision or ruling is supported by, and in accordance with, the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence contained in the record. In order to prevail, the party with the burden of proof must prove the party's case or defense by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.
            
            
              § 406.153
              Burden of proof.
              (a) Except in the case of an affirmative defense, in a civil penalty adjudication the burden of proof is on the complainant.
              (b) Except as otherwise provided by statute or rule, the proponent of a motion, request, or order has the burden of proof.
              (c) A party who has asserted an affirmative defense has the burden of proving the affirmative defense.
            
            
              § 406.155
              Offer of proof.
              A party whose evidence has been excluded by a ruling of the administrative law judge may offer the evidence for the record on appeal.
            
            
              § 406.157
              Expert or opinion witnesses.
              An employee of the FAA may not be called as an expert or opinion witness for any party other than the agency, in any proceeding governed by this part. An employee of a respondent may not be called as an expert or opinion witness for the complainant in any proceeding governed by this part to which the respondent is a party.
            
            
              § 406.159
              Subpoenas.
              (a) Request for subpoena. A party may obtain from the administrative law judge a subpoena to compel the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing or to require the production of documents or tangible items. The administrative law judge must deliver the subpoena, signed by the administrative law judge but otherwise in blank, to the party. The party must complete the subpoena, stating the title of the action and the date and time for the witness' attendance or production of documents or items. The party who obtained the subpoena must serve the subpoena on the witness.
              (b) Motion to quash or modify the subpoena. A party, or any person upon whom a subpoena has been served, may file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena at or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance. The applicant must describe, in detail, the basis for the motion to quash or modify the subpoena including, but not limited to, a statement that the testimony, document, or tangible evidence is not relevant to the proceeding, that the subpoena is not reasonably tailored to the scope of the proceeding, or that the subpoena is unreasonable and oppressive. A motion to quash or modify the subpoena will stay the effect of the subpoena pending a decision by the administrative law judge on the motion.
              (c) Enforcement of subpoena. Upon a showing that a person has failed or refused to comply with a subpoena, the Secretary may apply to the appropriate district court of the United States to seek enforcement of the subpoena in accordance with 51 U.S.C. 50917(c). A party may request the Secretary to seek such enforcement.
              [Doc. No. FAA-2001-8607, 66 FR 2180, Jan. 10, 2001, as amended by Amdt. 406-7, 77 FR 20533, Apr. 5, 2012]
            
            
              § 406.161
              Witness fees.
              (a) General. Unless otherwise authorized by the administrative law judge, the party who applies for a subpoena to compel the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing, or the party at whose request a witness appears at a deposition or hearing, must pay the witness fees described in this section.
              
              (b) Amount. Except for an employee of the agency who appears at the direction of the agency, a witness who appears at a deposition or hearing is entitled to the same fees and mileage expenses as are paid to a witness in a court of the United States in comparable circumstances.
            
            
              § 406.163
              Record.
              (a) Exclusive record. The transcript of all testimony in the hearing; all exhibits received into evidence; the complaint, answer, and amendments thereto; all motions, applications, and requests, and responses thereto; and all rulings constitute the exclusive record for decision of the proceedings and the basis for the issuance of any orders in the proceeding.
              (b) A person may keep the original document, data, or other evidence, with the consent of the administrative law judge, by substituting a legible copy for the record.
            
            
              § 406.165
              Argument before the administrative law judge.
              (a) Argument during the hearing. During the hearing, the administrative law judge must give the parties a reasonable opportunity to present arguments on the record supporting or opposing motions, objections, and rulings if the parties request an opportunity for argument. The administrative law judge may request written arguments during the hearing if the administrative law judge finds that submission of written arguments would be reasonable.
              (b) Final oral argument. At the conclusion of the hearing and before the administrative law judge issues an initial decision in the proceedings, the parties are entitled to submit oral proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, exceptions to rulings of the administrative law judge, and supporting arguments for the findings, conclusions, or exceptions. At the conclusion of the hearing, a party may waive final oral argument.
              (c) Post-hearing briefs. The administrative law judge may request written post-hearing briefs before the administrative law judge issues an initial decision if the administrative law judge finds that submission of written briefs would be reasonable. If a party files a written post-hearing brief, the party must include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, exceptions to rulings of the administrative law judge, and supporting arguments for the findings, conclusions, or exceptions. The administrative law judge must give the parties a reasonable opportunity, not more than 30 days after receipt of the transcript, to prepare and submit the briefs.
            
            
              § 406.167
              Initial decision.
              (a) Contents. The administrative law judge must issue an initial decision at the conclusion of the hearing. In each oral or written decision, the administrative law judge must include findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the grounds supporting those findings and conclusions, upon all material issues of fact, the credibility of witnesses, the applicable law, any exercise of the administrative law judge's discretion, the amount of any civil penalty found appropriate by the administrative law judge, and a discussion of the basis for any order issued in the proceedings. The administrative law judge is not required to provide a written explanation for rulings on objections, procedural motions, and other matters not directly relevant to the substance of the initial decision. If the administrative law judge refers to any previous unreported or unpublished initial decision, the administrative law judge must make copies of that initial decision available to all parties and the FAA decisionmaker.
              (b) Oral decision. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, at the conclusion of the hearing, the administrative law judge must issue the initial decision and order orally on the record.
              (c) Written decision. The administrative law judge may issue a written initial decision not later than 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing or submission of the last posthearing brief if the administrative law judge finds that issuing a written initial decision is reasonable. The administrative law judge must serve a copy of any written initial decision on each party.
            
            
              § 406.173
              Interlocutory appeals.
              (a) General. Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, a party may not appeal a ruling or decision of the administrative law judge to the FAA decisionmaker until the initial decision has been entered on the record. A decision or order of the FAA decisionmaker on an interlocutory appeal does not constitute a final order of the Secretary for the purposes of judicial review under 5 U.S.C. chapter 7.
              (b) Interlocutory appeal for cause. If a party files a written request for an interlocutory appeal for cause, or orally requests an interlocutory appeal for cause, the proceedings are stayed until the administrative law judge issues a decision on the request. If the administrative law judge grants the request, the proceedings are stayed until the FAA decisionmaker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. The administrative law judge must grant an interlocutory appeal for cause if a party shows that delay of the interlocutory appeal would be detrimental to the public interest or would result in undue prejudice to any party.
              (c) Interlocutory appeals of right. If a party notifies the administrative law judge of an interlocutory appeal of right, the proceedings are stayed until the FAA decisionmaker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. A party may file an interlocutory appeal, without the consent of the administrative law judge, before an initial decision has been entered in the case of:
              (1) A ruling or order by the administrative law judge barring a party, or a party's attorney or representative, from the proceedings.
              (2) A ruling or order by the administrative law judge allegedly in violation of the limitations on the administrative law judge under § 406.109(c).
              (3) Failure of the administrative law judge to grant a motion for a confidentiality order based on 51 U.S.C. 50916, under § 406.117(c)(2).
              (4) Failure of the administrative law judge to dismiss the proceedings in accordance with § 406.135.
              (d) Procedure. A party must file with the Federal Docket Management System and serve each other party a notice of interlocutory appeal, with supporting documents, not later than 10 days after the administrative law judge's decision forming the basis of an interlocutory appeal of right or not later than 10 days after the administrative law judge's decision granting an interlocutory appeal for cause. A party must file with the Federal Docket Management System a reply brief, if any, and serve a copy of the reply brief on each party, not later than 10 days after service of the appeal brief. The FAA decisionmaker must render a decision on the interlocutory appeal, on the record and as a part of the decision in the proceedings, within a reasonable time after receipt of the interlocutory appeal.
              (e) Rejection of interlocutory appeal. The FAA decisionmaker may reject frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory appeals, and may issue an order precluding one or more parties from making further interlocutory appeals in a proceeding in which there have been frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory interlocutory appeals.
              [Doc. No. FAA-2001-8607, 66 FR 2180, Jan. 10, 2001, as amended at 72 FR 68477, Dec. 5, 2007; Amdt. 406-7, 77 FR 20533, Apr. 5, 2012]
            
            
              § 406.175
              Appeal from initial decision.
              (a) Notice of appeal. A party may appeal the initial decision, and any decision not previously appealed pursuant to 406.173, by filing with the Federal Docket Management System and serving on each party a notice of appeal. A party must file the notice of appeal not later than 10 days after entry of the oral initial decision on the record or service of the written initial decision on the parties.
              (b) Issues on appeal. A party may appeal only the following issues:
              (1) Whether each finding of fact is supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence;
              (2) Whether each conclusion of law is made in accordance with applicable law, precedent, and public policy; and
              (3) Whether the administrative law judge committed any prejudicial errors during the hearing that support the appeal.
              (c) Perfecting an appeal. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party must perfect an appeal, not later than 50 days after entry of the oral initial decision on the record or service of the written initial decision on the party, by filing an appeal brief.
              
              (1) Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may agree to extend the time for perfecting the appeal with the consent of the FAA decisionmaker, who serves a letter confirming the extension of time on each party.
              (2) Motion for extension. If the parties do not agree to an extension of time for perfecting an appeal, a party desiring an extension of time may file a motion for an extension and must serve a copy of the motion on each party. The FAA decisionmaker may grant an extension if good cause for the extension is shown in the motion.
              (d) Appeal briefs. A party must file the appeal brief with the Federal Docket Management System and serve each party.
              (1) A party must set forth, in detail, the party's specific objections to the initial decision or rulings in the appeal brief. A party also must set forth, in detail, the basis for the appeal, the reasons supporting the appeal, and the relief requested in the appeal. If the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the appeal, the party must specifically refer to the pertinent evidence contained in the record in the appeal brief.
              (2) The FAA decisionmaker may dismiss an appeal, on the FAA decisionmaker's own initiative or upon motion of any other party, where a party has filed a notice of appeal but fails to perfect the appeal by timely filing an appeal brief.
              (e) Reply brief. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, any party may file a reply brief with the Federal Docket Management System and serve on each other party not later than 35 days after the appeal brief has been served on that party. If the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the reply, the party must specifically refer to the pertinent evidence contained in the record in the reply brief.
              (1) Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may agree to extend the time for filing a reply brief with the consent of the FAA decisionmaker, who will serve a letter confirming the extension of time on each party.
              (2) Motion for extension. If the parties do not agree to an extension of time for filing a reply brief, a party desiring an extension of time may file and serve a motion for an extension and must serve a copy of the motion on each party. The FAA decisionmaker may grant an extension if good cause for the extension is shown in the motion.
              (f) Other briefs. The FAA decisionmaker may allow any person to submit an amicus curiae brief in an appeal of an initial decision. A party may not file more than one appeal brief or reply brief without permission of the FAA decisionmaker. A party may file with the Federal Docket Management System a motion for permission to file an additional brief and must serve a copy of the motion on each other party. The party may not file the additional brief with the motion. The FAA decisionmaker may grant permission to file an additional brief if the party demonstrates good cause for allowing additional argument on the appeal. The FAA decisionmaker will allow a reasonable time for the party to file the additional brief.
              (g) Number of copies. A party must file the original brief and two copies of the brief with the Federal Docket Management System and serve one copy on each other party.
              (h) Oral argument. The FAA decisionmaker has sole discretion to permit oral argument on the appeal. On the FAA decisionmaker's own initiative or upon written motion by any party, the FAA decisionmaker may find that oral argument will contribute substantially to the development of the issues on appeal and may grant the parties an opportunity for oral argument.
              (i) Waiver of objections on appeal. If a party fails to object to any alleged error regarding the proceedings in an appeal or a reply brief, the party waives any objection to the alleged error. The FAA decisionmaker is not required to consider any objection or argument in a brief if the party does not specifically refer in the brief to the pertinent evidence from the record.
              (j) FAA decisionmaker's decision on appeal. The FAA decisionmaker will review the record, the briefs on appeal, and the oral argument, if any, to determine if the administrative law judge committed prejudicial error in the proceedings or that the initial decision should be affirmed, modified, or reversed. The FAA decisionmaker may affirm, modify, or reverse the initial decision, make any necessary findings, or may remand the case for any proceedings that the FAA decisionmaker determines may be necessary.
              (1) The FAA decisionmaker may raise any issue, on the FAA decisionmaker's own initiative, that is required for proper disposition of the proceedings. The FAA decisionmaker will give the parties a reasonable opportunity to submit arguments on the new issues before making a decision on appeal. If an issue raised by the FAA decisionmaker requires the consideration of additional testimony or evidence, the FAA decisionmaker will remand the case to the administrative law judge for further proceedings and an initial decision related to that issue. If an issue raised by the FAA decisionmaker is solely an issue of law or the issue was addressed at the hearing but was not raised by a party in the briefs on appeal, a remand of the case to the administrative law judge for further proceedings is not required but may be provided in the discretion of the FAA decisionmaker.
              (2) The FAA decisionmaker will issue the final decision and order of the Administrator on appeal in writing and will serve a copy of the decision and order on each party.
              (3) A final decision and order of the FAA decisionmaker is precedent in any other civil penalty action under this part. Any issue, finding or conclusion, order, ruling, or initial decision of an administrative law judge that has not been appealed to the FAA decisionmaker is not precedent in any other civil penalty action.

              § 406.177
              Petition to reconsider or modify a final decision and order of the FAA decisionmaker on appeal.
              (a) General. Any party may petition the FAA decisionmaker to reconsider or modify a final decision and order issued by the FAA decisionmaker on appeal from an initial decision. A party must file a petition to reconsider or modify with the Federal Docket Management System not later than 30 days after service of the FAA decisionmaker's final decision and order on appeal and must serve a copy of the petition on each party. The FAA decisionmaker will not reconsider or modify an initial decision and order issued by an administrative law judge that has not been appealed by any party to the FAA decisionmaker.
              (b) Contents. A party must state briefly and specifically the alleged errors in the final decision and order on appeal, the relief sought by the party, and the grounds that support, the petition to reconsider or modify.
              (1) If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on allegations regarding the consequences of the FAA decisionmaker's decision, the party must describe these allegations and must describe, and support, the basis for the allegations.
              (2) If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on new material not previously raised in the proceedings, the party must set forth the new material and include affidavits of prospective witnesses and authenticated documents that would be introduced in support of the new material. The party must explain, in detail, why the new material was not discovered through due diligence prior to the hearing.
              (c) Repetitious and frivolous petition. The FAA decisionmaker will not consider a repetitious or frivolous petition. The FAA decisionmaker may summarily dismiss any repetitious or frivolous petition to reconsider or modify.
              (d) Reply to petition. Any other party may reply to a petition to reconsider or modify, not later than 10 days after service of the petition on that party, by filing a reply. A party must serve a copy of the reply on each party.
              (e) Effect of filing petition. Unless otherwise ordered by the FAA decisionmaker, filing a petition under this section stays the effective date of the FAA decisionmaker's final decision and order on appeal, and tolls the time allowed for judicial review.
              (f) FAA decisionmaker's decision on petition. The FAA decisionmaker may affirm, modify, or reverse the final decision and order on appeal, or may remand the case for any proceedings that the FAA decisionmaker determines may be necessary.

              § 406.179
              Judicial review of a final decision and order.
              (a) A person may seek judicial review of a final decision and order of the FAA decisionmaker as provided in 5 U.S.C. chapter 7 and 28 U.S.C. 1331. A party seeking judicial review must file with a United States district court.
              (b) In accordance with § 406.9(e)(iv), if a person seeks judicial review not later than 60 days after the final decision and order has been served on the respondent, the final decision and order is stayed.
              (c) In accordance with § 406.9(i), if a respondent does not pay a civil penalty and does not file an appeal with the United States district court within 60 days after service of the final decision and order, the FAA may refer the order to the United States Department of Treasury or Department of Justice to collect the civil penalty.

            § 413.5
            Pre-application consultation.
            A prospective applicant must consult with the FAA before submitting an application to discuss the application process and possible issues relevant to the FAA's licensing or permitting decision. Early consultation helps an applicant to identify possible regulatory issues at the planning stage when changes to an application or to proposed licensed or permitted activities are less likely to result in significant delay or costs to the applicant.

            § 413.9
            Confidentiality.
            (a) Any person furnishing information or data to the FAA may request in writing that trade secrets or proprietary commercial or financial data be treated as confidential. The request must be made at the time the information or data is submitted, and state the period of time for which confidential treatment is desired.
            (b) Information or data for which any person or agency requests confidentiality must be clearly marked with an identifying legend, such as “Proprietary Information,” “Proprietary Commercial Information,” “Trade Secret,” or “Confidential Treatment Requested.” Where this marking proves impracticable, a cover sheet containing the identifying legend must be securely attached to the compilation of information or data for which confidential treatment is requested.
            (c) If a person requests that previously submitted information or data be treated confidentially, the FAA will do so to the extent practicable in light of any prior distribution of the information or data.
            (d) Information or data for which confidential treatment has been requested or information or data that qualifies for exemption under section 552(b)(4) of Title 5, United States Code, will not be disclosed to the public unless the Associate Administrator determines that the withholding of the information or data is contrary to the public or national interest.
          
          
            § 413.11
            Acceptance of an application.
            The FAA will initially screen an application to determine whether it is complete enough for the FAA to start its review. After completing the initial screening, the FAA will notify the applicant in writing of one of the following:
            (a) The FAA accepts the application and will initiate the reviews required to make a decision about the license or permit; or
            (b) The application is so incomplete or indefinite that the FAA cannot start to evaluate it. The FAA will reject it and notify the applicant, stating each reason for rejecting it and what action the applicant must take for the FAA to accept the application. The FAA may return a rejected application to the applicant or may hold it until the applicant takes the required actions.

            § 413.13
            Complete application.
            The FAA's acceptance of an application does not mean it has determined that the application is complete. If, in addition to the information required by this chapter, the FAA requires other information necessary for a determination that public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States are protected during the conduct of a licensed or permitted activity, an applicant must submit the additional information.

            § 413.15
            Review period.
            (a) Review period duration. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, the FAA reviews and makes a decision on an application within 180 days of receiving an accepted license application or within 120 days of receiving an accepted permit application.
            (b) Review period tolled. If an accepted application does not provide sufficient information to continue or complete the reviews or evaluations required by this chapter for a licensing or permitting determination, or an issue exists that would affect a determination, the FAA notifies the applicant, in writing, and informs the applicant of any information required to complete the application. If the FAA cannot review an accepted application because of lack of information or for any other reason, the FAA will toll the 180-day or 120-day review period until the FAA receives the information it needs or the applicant resolves the issue.
            (c) Notice. If the FAA does not make a decision within 120 days of receiving an accepted license application or within 90 days of receiving an accepted permit application, the FAA informs the applicant, in writing, of any outstanding information needed to complete the review, or of any issues that would affect the decision.

            Continuing accuracy of application; supplemental information; amendment.
            (a) An applicant must ensure the continuing accuracy and completeness of information furnished to the FAA as part of a pending license or permit application. If at any time the information an applicant provides is no longer accurate and complete in all material respects, the applicant must submit new or corrected information. As part of this submission, the applicant must recertify the accuracy and completeness of the application under § 413.7. If an applicant does not comply with any of the requirements set forth in this paragraph, the FAA can deny the license or permit application.
            (b) An applicant may amend or supplement a license or permit application at any time before the FAA issues or transfers the license or permit.
            (c) Willful false statements made in any application or document relating to an application, license, or permit are punishable by fine and imprisonment under section 1001 of Title 18, United States Code, and by administrative sanctions in accordance with part 405 of this chapter.

            (a) The FAA informs an applicant, in writing, if it denies an application and states the reasons for denial.
            (b) If the FAA has denied an application, the applicant may either:
            (1) Attempt to correct any deficiencies identified and ask the FAA to reconsider the revised application. The FAA has 60 days or the number of days remaining in the review period, whichever is greater, within which to reconsider the decision; or
            (2) Request a hearing in accordance with part 406 of this chapter, for the purpose of showing why the application should not be denied.
            (c) An applicant whose license application is denied after reconsideration under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may request a hearing in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

            (a) Eligibility. A licensee or permittee may apply to renew its license or permit by submitting to the FAA a written application for renewal at least 90 days before the license expires or at least 60 days before the permit expires.
            (b) Application. (1) A license or permit renewal application must satisfy the requirements set forth in this part and any other applicable part of this chapter.
            (2) The application may incorporate by reference information provided as part of the application for the expiring license or permit, including any modifications to the license or permit.
            (3) An applicant must describe any proposed changes in its conduct of licensed or permitted activities and provide any additional clarifying information required by the FAA.
            (c) Review of application. The FAA reviews the application to determine whether to renew the license or permit for an additional term. The FAA may incorporate by reference any findings that are part of the record for the expiring license or permit.
            (d) Renewal of license or permit. After the FAA finishes its reviews, the FAA issues an order modifying the expiration date of the license or permit. The FAA may impose additional or revised terms and conditions necessary to protect public health and safety and the safety of property and to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.
            (e) Denial of license or permit renewal. The FAA informs a licensee or permittee, in writing, if the FAA denies the application for renewal and states the reasons for denial. If the FAA denies an application, the licensee or permittee may follow the procedures of § 413.21 of this part.

            Subpart A—General
            
              § 414.1
              Scope.
              This part establishes procedures for obtaining a safety approval and renewing and transferring an existing safety approval. Safety approvals issued under this part may be used to support the application review for one or more launch or reentry license requests under other parts of this chapter.
            
            
              § 414.3
              Definitions.
              
                Safety approval. For purposes of this part, a safety approval is an FAA document containing the FAA determination that one or more of the safety elements listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition, when used or employed within a defined envelope, parameter, or situation, will not jeopardize public health and safety or safety of property. A safety approval may be issued independent of a license, and it does not confer any authority to conduct activities for which a license is required under 14 CFR chapter III. A safety approval does not relieve its holder of the duty to comply with all applicable requirements of law or regulation that may apply to the holder's activities.
              (1) Launch vehicle, reentry vehicle, safety system, process, service, or any identified component thereof; or
              (2) Qualified and trained personnel, performing a process or function related to licensed launch activities or vehicles.
              
                Safety element. For purposes of this part, a safety element is any one of the items or persons (personnel) listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of the definition of “safety approval” in this section.
            
            
              § 414.5
              Applicability.

              This part applies to an applicant that wants to obtain a safety approval for any of the safety elements defined under this part and to persons granted a safety approval under this part. Any person eligible under this part may apply to become the holder of a safety approval.
            
            
              § 414.7
              Eligibility.
              (a) There is no citizenship requirement to obtain a safety approval.
              (b) You may be eligible for a safety approval if you are—
              (1) A manufacturer or designer of a launch or reentry vehicle or component thereof;
              (2) The designer or developer of a safety system or process; or
              (3) Personnel who perform safety critical functions in conducting a licensed launch or reentry.
              (c) A safety approval applicant must have sufficient knowledge and expertise to show that the design and operation of the safety element for which safety approval is sought qualify for a safety approval.
              (d) Only the safety elements defined under this part are eligible for a safety approval.

              [Doc. No. FAA-2005-21332, 71 FR 46853, Aug. 15, 2006, as amended by Amdt. 414-3, 80 FR 30151, May 27, 2015]
            
            
              § 414.13
              Confidentiality.
              (a) To ensure confidentiality of data or information in the application, the applicant must—
              (1) Send a written request with the application that trade secrets or proprietary commercial or financial data be treated as confidential, and include in the request the specific time frame confidential treatment is required.
              (2) Mark data or information that require confidentiality with an identifying legend, such as “Proprietary Information,” “Proprietary Commercial Information,” “Trade Secret,” or “Confidential Treatment Requested.” Where this marking proves impracticable, attach a cover sheet that contains the identifying legend to the data or information for which confidential treatment is sought.
              (b) If the applicant requests confidential treatment for previously submitted data or information, the FAA will honor that request to the extent practicable in case of any prior distribution of the data or information.
              (c) Data or information for which confidential treatment is requested or data or information that qualifies for exemption under section 552(b)(4) of Title 5, U.S.C., will not be disclosed to the public unless the Associate Administrator determines that withholding the data or information is contrary to the public or national interest.
              (d) If the proposed criteria for evaluating a safety approval is secret, as classified by the U.S. Government, or the applicant wants it to remain proprietary or confidential, it cannot be used as a basis for issuance of a safety approval.
            
            
              § 414.15
              Processing the initial application.
              (a) The FAA will initially screen an application to determine if the application is sufficiently complete to enable the FAA to initiate the reviews or evaluations required under this part.
              (b) After completing the initial screening, the FAA will inform the applicant in writing of one of the following:
              (1) The FAA accepts the application and will begin the reviews or evaluations required for a safety approval determination under this part.
              (2) The FAA rejects the application because it is incomplete or indefinite making initiation of the reviews or evaluations required for a safety approval determination under this part inappropriate.

              (c) The written notice will state the reason(s) for rejection and corrective actions necessary for the application to be accepted. The FAA may return a rejected application to the applicant or may hold it until the applicant provides more information.
              
              (d) The applicant may withdraw, amend, or supplement an application anytime before the FAA makes a final determination on the safety approval application by making a written request to the Associate Administrator.

              (a) The FAA will issue a safety approval to an applicant that meets all the requirements under this part.
              (b) The scope of the safety approval will be limited by the scope of the safety demonstration contained in the application on which the FAA based the decision to grant the safety approval.
              (c) The FAA will determine specific terms and conditions of a safety approval individually, limiting the safety approval to the scope for which the safety-approved launch or reentry element was approved. The terms and conditions will include reporting requirements tailored to the individual safety approval.
              (d) A safety approval is valid for five years and may be renewed.
              (e) If the FAA denies the application, the applicant may correct any deficiency the FAA identified and request a reconsideration of the revised application. The applicant also has the right to appeal a denial as set forth in subpart D of this part.

              (b) If any representation contained in the application that is material to public health and safety or safety of property ceases to be accurate and complete, the safety approval holder must prepare and submit a revised application according to § 414.11 under this part. The safety approval holder must point out any part of the safety approval or the associated application that would be changed or affected by a proposed modification. The FAA will review and make a determination on the revised application under the terms of this part.
              (c) If the FAA approves the revised application, the FAA will provide written notice to the holder, stating the terms and conditions to which the approval is subject.
            
            
              § 414.25
              Safety approval records.
              The holder of a safety approval must maintain all records necessary to verify that the holder's activities are consistent with the representations contained in the application for which the approval was issued for the duration of the safety approval plus one year.
            
            
              § 414.27
              Safety approval renewal.
              (a) Eligibility. A holder of a safety approval may apply to renew it by sending the FAA a written application at least 90 days before the expiration date of the approval.

              (2) The application may incorporate by reference information provided as part of the application for the expiring safety approval or any modification to that approval.
              (3) Any proposed changes in the conduct of a safety element for which the FAA has issued a safety approval must be described and must include any added information necessary to support the fitness of the proposed changes to meet the criteria upon which the FAA evaluated the safety approval application.
              (c) Review of application. The FAA conducts the reviews required under this part to determine whether the safety approval may be renewed. We may incorporate by reference any findings that are part of the record for the expiring safety approval.
              (d) Grant of safety approval renewal. If the FAA makes a favorable safety approval determination, the FAA issues an order that amends the expiration date of the safety approval or issues a new safety approval. The FAA may impose added or revised terms and conditions necessary to protect public health and safety and the safety of property.
              (e) Written notice. The FAA will provide written notice to the applicant of our determination on the safety approval renewal request.
              (f) Denial of a safety approval renewal.

              § 415.3
              Types of launch licenses.
              (a) Launch-specific license. A launch-specific license authorizes a licensee to conduct one or more launches, having the same launch parameters, of one type of launch vehicle from one launch site. The license identifies, by name or mission, each launch authorized under the license. A licensee's authorization to launch terminates upon completion of all launches authorized by the license or the expiration date stated in the license, whichever occurs first.
              (b) Launch operator license. A launch operator license authorizes a licensee to conduct launches from one launch site, within a range of launch parameters, of launch vehicles from the same family of vehicles transporting specified classes of payloads. A launch operator license remains in effect for five years from the date of issuance.
            
            
              § 415.5
              Policy and safety approvals.
              To obtain a launch license, an applicant must obtain policy and safety approvals from the FAA. Requirements for obtaining these approvals are contained in subparts B, C and F of this part. Only a launch license applicant may apply for the approvals, and may apply for either approval separately and in advance of submitting a complete license application, using the application procedures contained in part 413 of this subchapter.
            
            
              § 415.7
              Payload determination.
              A payload determination is required for a launch license unless the proposed payload is exempt from payload review under § 415.53 of this part. The FAA conducts a payload review, as described in subpart D of this part, to make the determination. Either a launch license applicant or a payload owner or operator may request a review of its proposed payload using the application procedures contained in part 413 of this subchapter. Upon receipt of an application, the FAA may conduct a payload review independently of a launch license application.
            
            
              § 415.8
              Human space flight.

              § 415.31
              General.

              (a) The FAA conducts a safety review to determine whether an applicant is capable of launching a launch vehicle and its payload without jeopardizing public health and safety and safety of property. The FAA issues a safety approval to a license applicant proposing to launch from a Federal launch range if the applicant satisfies the requirements of this subpart and has contracted with the Federal launch range for the provision of safety-related launch services and property, as long as an FAA launch site safety assessment shows that the range's launch services and launch property satisfy part 417 of this chapter. The FAA evaluates on an individual basis all other safety-related launch services and property associated with an applicant's proposal, in accordance with part 417 of this chapter. A safety approval is part of the licensing record on which the FAA's licensing determination is based.
              (b) The FAA advises an applicant, in writing, of any issue raised during a safety review that would impede issuance of a safety approval. The applicant may respond, in writing, or revise its license application.

            Subpart D—Payload Review and Determination
            
              § 415.51
              General.
              The FAA reviews a payload proposed for launch to determine whether a license applicant or payload owner or operator has obtained all required licenses, authorization, and permits, unless the payload is exempt from review under § 415.53 of this subpart. If not otherwise exempt, the FAA reviews a payload proposed for launch to determine whether its launch would jeopardize public health and safety, safety of property, U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, or international obligations of the United States. A payload determination is part of the licensing record on which the FAA's licensing determination is based. The safety requirements of subpart C and F of this part and of part 417 of this chapter apply to all payloads, whether or not the payload is otherwise exempt.

            Subpart A—General and License Terms and Conditions
            
              § 417.1
              General information.
              (a) Scope. This part sets forth—
              (1) The responsibilities of a launch operator conducting a licensed launch of an expendable launch vehicle; and

              (2) The requirements for maintaining a launch license obtained under part 415 of this chapter. Parts 413 and 415 of this chapter contain requirements for preparing a license application to conduct a launch, including information reviewed by the FAA to conduct a policy, safety, payload, and environmental review., and a payload determination.
              (b) Applicability. (1) The administrative requirements for filing material with the FAA in subpart A of this part apply to all licensed launches from a Federal launch range or a non-Federal launch site, except where noted.
              (2) The safety requirements of subparts B through E of this part apply to all licensed launches of expendable launch vehicles. See paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section for exceptions to this provision.
              (c) “Meets intent” certification. For a licensed launch from a Federal launch range, a launch operator need not demonstrate to the FAA that an alternative means of satisfying a requirement of this part provides an equivalent level of safety for a launch if written evidence demonstrates that a Federal launch range has, by the effective date of this part, granted a “meets intent certification,” including through “tailoring,” that applies to the requirement and that launch. See paragraph (f) of this section for exceptions to this provision. Written evidence includes:
              (1) Range flight plan approval,
              (2) Missile system pre-launch safety package,
              (3) Preliminary and final flight data packages,
              (4) A tailored version of EWR 127-1,
              (5) Range email to the FAA stating that the MIC was approved, or
              (6) Operation approval.
              (d) Waiver. For a licensed launch from a Federal launch range, a requirement of this part does not apply to a launch if written evidence demonstrates that a Federal launch range has, by the effective date of this part, granted a waiver that allows noncompliance with the requirement for that launch. See paragraph (f) of this section for exceptions to this provision. Written evidence includes:
              (1) Range flight plan approval,
              (2) Missile system pre-launch safety package,
              (3) Preliminary and final flight data packages,
              (4) A tailored version of EWR 127-1,
              (5) Range email to the FAA stating that the waiver was approved, or
              (6) Operation approval.
              (e) Grandfathering. For a licensed launch from a Federal launch range, a requirement of this part does not apply to the launch if the Federal launch range's grandfathering criteria allow noncompliance with the requirement for that launch. See paragraph (f) of this section for exceptions to this provision.
              (f) Exceptions to Federal launch range meets intent certifications, waivers, and grandfathering. Even if a licensed launch from a Federal launch range satisfies paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section for a requirement of this part, the requirement applies and a launch operator must satisfy the requirement, obtain FAA approval of any alternative, or obtain FAA approval for any further noncompliance if—
              (1) The launch operator modifies the launch vehicle's operation or safety characteristics;
              (2) The launch operator uses the launch vehicle, component, system, or subsystem in a new application;
              (3) The FAA or the launch operator determines that a previously unforeseen or newly discovered safety hazard exists that is a source of significant risk to public safety; or
              (4) The Federal launch range previously accepted a component, system, or subsystem, but did not then identify a noncompliance to a Federal launch range requirement.
              (g) Equivalent level of safety. The requirements of this part apply to a launch operator and the launch operator's launch unless the launch operator clearly and convincingly demonstrates that an alternative approach provides an equivalent level of safety.
            
            
              § 417.3
              Definitions and acronyms.

                Flight safety limit means criteria to ensure a set of impact limit lines established for the flight of a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system bound the area where debris with a ballistic coefficient of three or more is allowed to impact when a flight safety system functions.
              
              
                Flight safety system means the system that provides a means of control during flight for preventing a hazard from a launch vehicle, including any payload hazard, from reaching any populated or other protected area in the event of a launch vehicle failure. A flight safety system includes:
              (1) All hardware and software used to protect the public in the event of a launch vehicle failure; and
              (2) The functions of any flight safety crew.
              
                Flight safety crew means the personnel, designated by a launch operator, who operate flight safety system hardware and software to monitor the flight of a launch vehicle and make a flight termination decision.
              
                Flight termination system means all components, onboard a launch vehicle, that provide the ability to end a launch vehicle's flight in a controlled manner. A flight termination system consists of all command destruct systems, inadvertent separation destruct systems, or other systems or components that are onboard a launch vehicle and used to terminate flight.
              
                Gate means the portion of a flight safety limit boundary through which the tracking icon of a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system may pass without flight termination.
              
                In-family means a launch vehicle component or system test result that indicates that the component or system's performance conforms to the family performance data that was established by previous test results.

                Launch azimuth means the horizontal angular direction initially taken by a launch vehicle at liftoff, measured clockwise in degrees from true north.
              
                Launch crew means all personnel who control the countdown and flight of a launch vehicle or who make irrevocable operational decisions that have the potential for impacting public safety. A launch crew includes members of the flight safety crew.
              
                Launch processing means all preflight preparation of a launch vehicle at a launch site, including buildup of the launch vehicle, integration of the payload, and fueling.
              
                Launch wait means a relatively short period of time when launch is not permitted in order to avoid a conjunction on launch or to safely accommodate temporary intrusion into a flight hazard area. A launch wait can occur within a launch window, can delay the start of a launch window, or terminate a launch window early.
              
                Launch window means a period of time during which the flight of a launch vehicle may be initiated.
              
                “Meets intent” certification means a decision by a Federal launch range to accept a substitute means of satisfying a safety requirement where the substitute provides an equivalent level of safety to that of the original requirement.
              
                Normal flight means the flight of a properly performing launch vehicle whose real-time instantaneous impact point does not deviate from the nominal instantaneous impact point by more than the sum of the wind effects and the three-sigma guidance and performance deviations in the uprange, downrange, left-crossrange, or right-crossrange directions.

                Non-operating environment means an environment that a launch vehicle component experiences before flight and when not otherwise being subjected to acceptance tests. Non-operating environments include, but need not be limited to, storage, transportation, and installation.
              
                Operating environment means an environment that a launch vehicle component will experience during acceptance testing, launch countdown, and flight. Operating environments include shock, vibration, thermal cycle, acceleration, humidity, and thermal vacuum.
              
                Operating life means, for a flight safety system component, the period of time beginning with activation of the component or installation of the component on a launch vehicle, whichever is earlier, for which the component is capable of satisfying all its performance specifications through the end of flight.
              
                Operation hazard means a hazard derived from an unsafe condition created by a system or operating environment or by an unsafe act.
              
                Out-of-family means a component or system test result where the component or system's performance does not conform to the family performance data that was established by previous test results and is an indication of a potential problem with the component or system requiring further investigation and possible corrective action.
              
                Passive component means a flight termination system component that does not contain active electronic piece parts.
              
                Performance specification means a statement prescribing the particulars of how a component or part is expected to perform in relation to the system that contains the component or part. A performance specification includes specific values for the range of operation, input, output, or other parameters that define the component's or part's expected performance.
              
                Protected area means an area of land not controlled by a launch operator that:
              (1) Is a populated area;
              (2) Is environmentally sensitive; or
              (3) Contains a vital national asset.
              
                Safety-critical computer system function means any computer system function that, if not performed, if performed out of sequence, or if performed incorrectly, may directly or indirectly cause a public safety hazard.
              
                Service life means, for a flight termination system component, the sum total of the component's storage life and operating life.
              
                Storage life means, for a flight termination system component, the period of time after manufacturing of the component is complete until the component is activated or installed on a launch vehicle, whichever is earlier, during which the component may be subjected to storage environments and must remain capable of satisfying all its performance specifications.
              
                Sub-vehicle point means the location on an ellipsoidal Earth model where the normal to the ellipsoid passes through the launch vehicle's center of gravity. The term is the same as the weapon system term “sub-missile point.”

              § 417.7
              Public safety responsibility.
              A launch operator is responsible for ensuring the safe conduct of a licensed launch and for ensuring public safety and safety of property at all times during the conduct of a licensed launch.
            
            
              § 417.9
              Launch site responsibility.
              (a) A launch operator must ensure that launch processing at a launch site in the United States satisfies the requirements of this part. Launch processing at a launch site outside the United States may be subject to the requirements of the governing jurisdiction.
              (b) For a launch from a launch site licensed under part 420 of this chapter, a launch operator must—
              (1) Conduct its operations as required by any agreements that the launch site operator has with any Federal and local authorities under part 420 of this chapter; and
              (2) Coordinate with the launch site operator and provide any information on its activities and potential hazards necessary for the launch site operator to determine how to protect any other launch operator, person, or property at the launch site as required by the launch site operator's obligations under § 420.55 of this chapter.

              (c) For a launch from an exclusive-use site, where there is no licensed launch site operator, a launch operator must satisfy the requirements of this part and the public safety requirements of part 420 of this chapter. This subpart does not apply to licensed launches occurring from Federal launch ranges.
            
            
              § 417.11
              Continuing accuracy of license application; application for modification of license.
              (a) A launch operator must ensure the representations contained in its application are accurate for the entire term of the license. A launch operator must conduct a licensed launch and carry out launch safety procedures in accordance with its application.
              (b) After the FAA issues a launch license, a launch operator must apply to the FAA for modification of a launch license if—
              (1) A launch operator proposes to conduct a launch or carry out a launch safety procedure or operation in a manner that is not authorized by the license; or
              (2) Any representation contained in the license application that is material to public health and safety or safety of property would no longer be accurate and complete or would not reflect the launch operator's procedures governing the actual conduct of a launch. A representation is material to public health and safety or safety of property if it alters or affects the launch operator's launch plans or procedures, class of payload, orbital destination, type of launch vehicle, flight path, launch site, launch point, or any safety system, policy, procedure, requirement, criteria or standard.
              (c) A launch operator must prepare and file an application to modify a launch license under part 413 of this chapter. The launch operator must identify any part of its license or license application that a proposed modification would change or affect.
              (d) The FAA reviews all approvals and determinations required by this chapter to determine whether they remain valid in light of a proposed modification. The FAA approves a modification that satisfies the requirements of this part.
              (e) Upon approval of a modification, the FAA issues to a launch operator either a written approval or a license order modifying the license if a stated term or condition of the license is changed, added or deleted. A written approval has the full force and effect of a license order and is part of the licensing record.

              (D) Must file the analysis products using the same format and organization used in its license application; and
              (E) May not change an analysis product within the final 30 days before flight unless the launch operator identified a process for making a change in that period as part of the launch operator's flight safety analysis process and the FAA approved the process by grant of a license to the launch operator.
              (ii) A launch operator need not file the 30-day analysis if the launch operator:

              (A) Demonstrates that the analysis filed during the license application process satisfies all the requirements of this subpart; and
              
              (B) Demonstrates the analysis does not need to be updated to account for launch specific factors.
              (4) Flight termination system qualification test reports. For the launch of a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, a launch operator must file all flight termination system qualification test reports, or test report summaries, as required by section E417.1(i) of appendix E of this part, with the FAA no later than six months before the first flight attempt . The summary must identify when and where the tests were performed and provide the results. Complete qualification test reports must be made available to the FAA upon request.
              (5) Flight termination system acceptance and age surveillance test report summaries. For the launch of a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, a launch operator must file a summary of the results of each flight termination system acceptance and age surveillance test, or the complete test report, as required by section E417.1(i) of appendix E of this part, no later than 30 days before the first flight attempt for each launch . The summary must identify when and where the tests were performed and provide the results. Complete acceptance and age surveillance test reports must be made available to the FAA upon request.
              (6) Command control system acceptance test reports. For the launch of a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, a launch operator must file all command control system acceptance test reports, or test report summaries, as required by § 417.305(d), with the FAA no later than 30 days before the first flight attempt. The summary must identify when and where the tests were performed and provide the results. Complete acceptance test reports must be made available to the FAA upon request.
              (7) Ground safety analysis report updates. A launch operator must file ground safety analysis report updates with the FAA as soon as the need for the change is identified and at least 30 days before the associated activity takes place. A launch operator must file a license modification request with the FAA for each change that involves the addition of a hazard that can affect public safety or the elimination of a previously identified hazard control for a hazard that still exists.

            Subpart B—Launch Safety Responsibilities
            
              § 417.101
              Scope.
              This subpart contains public safety requirements that apply to the launch of an orbital or suborbital expendable launch vehicle from a Federal launch range or other launch site. If the FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that an applicable range safety-related launch service or property satisfies the requirements of this subpart, then the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's launch service or property as that of a launch operator without need for further demonstration of compliance to the FAA if:
              (a) A launch operator has contracted with a Federal launch range for the provision of the safety-related launch service or property; and
              (b) The FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the Federal launch range's safety-related launch service or property satisfy the requirements of this subpart. In this case, the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's process as that of a launch operator.
            
            
              § 417.103
              Safety organization.
              (a) A launch operator must maintain and document a safety organization. A launch operator must identify lines of communication and approval authority for all public safety decisions, including those regarding design, operations, and analysis. A launch operator must describe its lines of communication, both within the launch operator's organization and between the launch operator and any federal launch range or other launch site operator providing launch services, in writing. Documented approval authority shall also be employed by the launch operator throughout the life of the launch system to ensure public safety and compliance with this part.
              (b) A launch operator's safety organization must include, but need not be limited to, the following launch management positions:
              (1) An employee of the launch operator who has the launch operator's final approval authority for launch. This employee, referred to as the launch director in this part, must ensure compliance with this part.

              (2) An employee of the launch operator who is authorized to examine all aspects of the launch operator's launch safety operations and to monitor independently personnel compliance with the launch operator's safety policies and procedures. This employee, referred to as the safety official in this part, shall have direct access to the launch director, who shall ensure that all of the safety official's concerns are addressed prior to launch.
            
            
              § 417.105
              Launch personnel qualifications and certification.
              (a) General. A launch operator must employ a personnel certification program that documents the qualifications, including education, experience, and training, for each member of the launch crew.
              (b) Personnel certification program. A launch operator's personnel certification program must:
              (1) Conduct an annual personnel qualifications review and issue individual certifications to perform safety related tasks.
              (2) Revoke individual certifications for negligence or failure to satisfy certification requirements.
            
            
              § 417.107
              Flight safety.
              (a) Flight safety system. For each launch vehicle, vehicle component, and payload, a launch operator must use a flight safety system that satisfies subpart D of this part as follows, unless § 417.125 applies.
              (1) In the vicinity of the launch site. For each launch vehicle, vehicle component, and payload, a launch operator must use a flight safety system in the vicinity of the launch site if the following exist:
              (i) Any hazard from a launch vehicle, vehicle component, or payload can reach any protected area at any time during flight; or
              (ii) A failure of the launch vehicle would have a high consequence to the public.
              (2) In the downrange area. For each launch vehicle, vehicle component, and payload, a launch operator must provide a flight safety system downrange if the absence of a flight safety system would significantly increase the accumulated risk from debris impacts.
              (b) Public risk criteria. A launch operator may initiate the flight of a launch vehicle only if flight safety analysis performed under paragraph (f) of this section demonstrates that any risk to the public satisfies the following public risk criteria:

              (1) A launch operator may initiate the flight of a launch vehicle only if the total risk associated with the launch to all members of the public, excluding persons in water-borne vessels and aircraft, does not exceed an expected number of 1 × 10−4 casualties. The total risk consists of risk posed by impacting inert and explosive debris, toxic release, and far field blast overpressure. The FAA will determine whether to approve public risk due to any other hazard associated with the proposed flight of a launch vehicle on a case-by-case basis. The Ec criterion applies to each launch from lift-off through orbital insertion for an orbital launch, and through final impact for a suborbital launch.

              (2) A launch operator may initiate flight only if the risk to any individual member of the public does not exceed a casualty expectation of 1 × 10−6 per launch for each hazard.

              (3) A launch operator must establish any water borne vessel hazard areas necessary to ensure the probability of impact (Pi) with debris capable of causing a casualty for water borne vessels does not exceed 1 × 10−5.

              (4) A launch operator must establish any aircraft hazard areas necessary to ensure the probability of impact (Pi) with debris capable of causing a casualty for aircraft does not exceed 1 × 10−6.
              (c) Debris thresholds. A launch operator's flight safety analysis, performed as required by paragraph (f) of this section, must account for any inert debris impact with a mean expected kinetic energy at impact greater than or equal to 11 ft-lbs and, except for the far field blast overpressure effects analysis of § 417.229, a peak incident overpressure greater than or equal to 1.0 psi due to any explosive debris impact.
              (1) When using the 11 ft-lbs threshold to determine potential casualties due to blunt trauma from inert debris impacts, the analysis must:

              (i) Incorporate a probabilistic model that accounts for the probability of casualty due to any debris expected to impact with kinetic energy of 11 ft-lbs or greater and satisfy paragraph (d) of this section; or
              
              (ii) Count each expected impact with kinetic energy of 11 ft-lbs or greater to a person as a casualty.
              (2) When applying the 1.0 psi threshold to determine potential casualties due to blast overpressure effects, the analysis must:
              (i) Incorporate a probabilistic model that accounts for the probability of casualty due to any blast overpressures of 1.0 psi or greater and satisfy paragraph (d) of this section; or
              (ii) Count each person within the 1.0 psi overpressure radius of the source explosion as a casualty. When using this approach, the analysis must compute the peak incident overpressure using the Kingery-Bulmash relationship and may not take into account sheltering, reflections, or atmospheric effects. For persons located in buildings, the analysis must compute the peak incident overpressure for the shortest distance between the building and the blast source. The analysis must count each person located anywhere in a building subjected to peak incident overpressure equal to or greater than 1.0 psi as a casualty.
              (d) Casualty modeling. A probabilistic casualty model must be based on accurate data and scientific principles and must be statistically valid. A launch operator must obtain FAA approval of any probabilistic casualty model that is used in the flight safety analysis. If the launch takes place from a Federal launch range, the analysis may employ any probabilistic casualty model that the FAA accepts as part of the FAA's launch site safety assessment of the Federal launch range's safety process.
              (e) Collision avoidance. (1) A launch operator must ensure that a launch vehicle, any jettisoned components, and its payload do not pass closer than 200 kilometers to a manned or mannable orbital object—
              (i) Throughout a sub-orbital launch; or
              (ii) For an orbital launch:
              (A) During ascent to initial orbital insertion and through at least one complete orbit; and
              (B) During each subsequent orbital maneuver or burn from initial park orbit, or direct ascent to a higher or interplanetary orbit or until clear of all manned or mannable objects, whichever occurs first.
              (2) A launch operator must obtain a collision avoidance analysis for each launch from United States Strategic Command or from a Federal range having an approved launch site safety assessment. United States Strategic Command calls this analysis a conjunction on launch assessment. Sections 417.231 and A417.31 of appendix A of this part contain the requirements for obtaining a collision avoidance analysis. A launch operator must use the results of the collision avoidance analysis to develop flight commit criteria for collision avoidance as required by § 417.113(c).
              (f) Flight safety analysis. A launch operator must perform and document a flight safety analysis as required by subpart C of this part. A launch operator must not initiate flight unless the flight safety analysis demonstrates that any risk to the public satisfies the public risk criteria of paragraph (b) of this section. For a licensed launch that involves a Federal launch range, the FAA will treat an analysis performed and documented by the Federal range, and which has an FAA approved launch site safety assessment, as that of the launch operator as provided in § 417.203(d) of subpart C of this part. A launch operator must use the flight safety analysis products to develop flight safety rules that govern a launch. Section 417.113 contains the requirements for flight safety rules.

              (i) Surveillance of any region of land, sea, or air necessary to ensure the number and location of members of the public are consistent with the inputs used for the flight safety analysis of subpart C of this part;
              (ii) Monitoring of any meteorological condition and implementing any flight constraint developed using appendix G of this part. The launch operator must have clear and convincing evidence that the lightning flight commit criteria of appendix G, which apply to the conditions present at the time of lift-off, are not violated. If any other hazardous conditions exist, other than those identified by appendix G, the launch weather team will report the hazardous condition to the official designated under § 417.103(b)(1), who will determine whether initiating flight would expose the launch vehicle to a lightning hazard and not initiate flight in the presence of the hazard; and
              (iii) Implementation of any launch wait in the launch window for the purpose of collision avoidance.
              (2) For a launch that uses a flight safety system, the flight-commit criteria must ensure that the flight safety system is ready for flight. This must include criteria for ensuring that:
              (i) The flight safety system is operating to ensure the launch vehicle will launch within all flight safety limits;
              (ii) Any command transmitter system required by section D417.9 has sufficient coverage from lift-off to the point in flight where the flight safety system is no longer required by § 417.107(a);

              (iii) The launch vehicle tracking system has no less than two tracking sources prior to lift-off. The launch vehicle tracking system has no less than one verified tracking source at all times from lift-off to orbit insertion for an orbital launch, to the end of powered flight for a suborbital launch; and
              
              (iv) The launch operator will employ its flight safety system as designed in accordance with this part.
              (3) For each launch, a launch operator must document the actual conditions used for the flight-commit criteria at the time of lift-off and verify whether the flight-commit criteria are satisfied.
              (d) Flight termination rules. For a launch that uses a flight safety system, the launch safety rules must identify the conditions under which the flight safety system, including the functions of the flight safety system crew, must terminate flight to ensure public safety. These flight termination rules must implement the flight safety analysis of subpart C of this part and include each of the following:
              (1) The flight safety system must terminate flight when valid, real-time data indicate the launch vehicle has violated any flight safety limit of § 417.213;
              (2) The flight safety system must terminate flight at the straight-up-time required by § 417.215 if the launch vehicle continues to fly a straight up trajectory and, therefore, does not turn downrange when it should;
              (3) The flight safety system must terminate flight when all of the following conditions exist:
              (i) Real-time data indicate that the performance of the launch vehicle is erratic;
              (ii) The potential exists for the loss of flight safety system control of the launch vehicle and further flight has the potential to endanger the public.
              (4) The flight termination rules must incorporate the data-loss flight times and planned safe flight state of § 417.219, including each of the following:
              (i) The flight safety system must terminate flight no later than the first data-loss flight time if, by that time, tracking of the launch vehicle is not established and vehicle position and status is unknown; and
              (ii) Once launch vehicle tracking is established and there is a subsequent loss of verified tracking data before the planned safe flight state and verified tracking data is not received again, the flight safety system must terminate flight no later than the expiration of the data-loss flight time for the point in flight that the data was lost.
              (5) For any gate established under § 417.217, both of the following apply:
              (i) The flight safety system must terminate flight if the launch vehicle is performing erratically immediately prior to entering the gate.
              (ii) The flight termination rules may permit the instantaneous impact point or other tracking icon to cross the gate only if there is no indication that the launch vehicle's performance has become erratic and the launch vehicle is either flying parallel to the nominal trajectory or converging to the nominal trajectory.
              (6) For any hold-and-resume gate established under § 417.218;
              (i) The flight safety system must terminate flight if the launch vehicle is performing erratically immediately prior to entering a hold gate.
              (ii) The flight termination rules may permit the instantaneous impact point or other tracking icon to cross a hold gate only if there is no indication that the launch vehicle's performance has become erratic and the vehicle is either flying parallel to the nominal trajectory or converging to the nominal trajectory.
              (iii) The flight termination rules of paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(3), and (d)(4) of this section apply after the instantaneous impact point or other tracking icon exits a resume gate.
              (e) Flight safety system safing. For a launch that uses a flight safety system, the launch safety rules must ensure that any safing of the flight safety system occurs on or after the point in flight where the flight safety system is no longer required by § 417.107(b).
              (f) Launch crew work shift and rest rules. For any operation with the potential to have an adverse effect on public safety, the launch safety rules must ensure the launch crew is physically and mentally capable of performing all assigned tasks. These rules must govern the length, number, and frequency of work shifts, including the rest afforded the launch crew between shifts.
            
            
              
              § 417.115

              (vi) A launch operator must verify the filing of all safety related information for a specific launch with the FAA, as required by FAA regulations and any special terms of a license. A launch operator must verify that information filed with the FAA reflects the current status of safety-related systems and processes for each specific launch.
              (3) Launch readiness review for flight. A launch operator must conduct a launch readiness review for flight as required by this section within 48 hours of flight. A person, identified as required by § 417.103(b)(1), must review all preflight testing and launch processing conducted up to the time of the review; and review the status of systems and support personnel to determine readiness to proceed with launch processing and the launch countdown. A decision to proceed must be in writing and signed by the person identified as required by § 417.103(b)(1), and any launch site operator or Federal launch range. A launch operator, during the launch readiness review, must poll the FAA to verify that the FAA has identified no issues related to the launch operator's license. During a launch readiness review, the launch operator must account for the following information:
              (i) Readiness of launch vehicle and payload.
              (ii) Readiness of any flight safety system and personnel and the results of flight safety system testing.
              (iii) Readiness of safety-related launch property and services to be provided by a Federal launch range.

              (xi) To review launch failure initial response actions and investigation roles and responsibilities.
            
            
              § 417.119
              Rehearsals.
              (a) General. A launch operator must rehearse its launch crew and systems to identify corrective actions needed to ensure public safety. The launch operator must conduct all rehearsals as follows:
              (1) A launch operator must assess any anomalies identified by a rehearsal, and must incorporate any changes to launch processing and flight needed to correct any anomaly that is material to public safety.
              (2) A launch operator must inform the FAA of any public safety related anomalies and related changes in operations performed during launch processing or flight resulting from a rehearsal.
              (3) For each launch, each person with a public safety critical role who will participate in the launch processing or flight of a launch vehicle must participate in at least one related rehearsal that exercises his or her role during nominal and non-nominal conditions so that the launch vehicle will not harm the public.
              (4) A launch operator must conduct the rehearsals identified in this section for each launch.
              (5) At least one rehearsal must simulate normal and abnormal preflight and flight conditions to exercise the launch operator's launch plans.
              (6) A launch operator may conduct rehearsals at the same time if joint rehearsals do not create hazardous conditions, such as changing a hardware configuration that affects public safety, during the rehearsal.
              (b) Countdown rehearsal. A launch operator must conduct a rehearsal using the countdown plan, procedures, and checklist required by § 417.111(l). A countdown rehearsal must familiarize launch personnel with all countdown activities, demonstrate that the planned sequence of events is correct, and demonstrate that there is adequate time allotted for each event. A launch operator must hold a countdown rehearsal after the assembly of the launch vehicle and any launch support systems into their final configuration for flight and before the launch readiness review required by § 417.117.
              (c) Emergency response rehearsal. A launch operator must conduct a rehearsal of the emergency response section of the accident investigation plan required by § 417.111(h)(2). A launch operator must conduct an emergency response rehearsal for a first launch of a new vehicle, for any additional launch that involves a new safety hazard, or for any launch where more than a year has passed since the last rehearsal.
              (d) Communications rehearsal. A launch operator must rehearse each part of the communications plan required by § 417.111(k), either as part of another rehearsal or during a communications rehearsal.
            
            
              § 417.121

              (a) General. A launch operator must perform safety critical preflight operations that protect the public from the adverse effects of hazards associated with launch processing and flight of a launch vehicle. The launch operator must identify all safety critical preflight operations in the launch schedule required by § 417.17(b)(1). Safety critical preflight operations must include those defined in this section.
              (b) Countdown. A launch operator must implement its countdown plan, of § 417.111(l), for each launch. A launch operator must disseminate a countdown plan to all personnel responsible for the countdown and flight of a launch vehicle, and each person must follow that plan.
              (c) Collision avoidance. A launch operator must coordinate with United States Strategic Command to obtain a collision avoidance analysis, also referred to as a conjunction on launch assessment, as required by § 417.231. A launch operator must implement flight commit criteria as required by § 417.113(c) to ensure that each launch meets all the criteria of § 417.107(e).
              (d) Meteorological data. A launch operator must conduct operations and coordinate with weather organizations, as needed, to obtain accurate meteorological data to support the flight safety analysis required by subpart C of this part and to ensure compliance with the flight commit criteria required by § 417.113.
              (e) Local notification. A launch operator must implement its local agreements and public coordination plan of § 417.111(i).
              (f) Hazard area surveillance. A launch operator must implement its hazard area surveillance and clearance plan, of § 417.111(j), to meet the public safety criteria of § 417.107(b) for each launch.
              (g) Flight safety system preflight tests. A launch operator must conduct preflight tests of any flight safety system as required by section E417.41 of appendix E of this part.
              (h) Launch vehicle tracking data verification.

For a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, any source of tracking data must satisfy the requirements of § 417.307(b).
              (i) Unguided suborbital rocket preflight operations. For the launch of an unguided suborbital rocket, in addition to meeting the other requirements of this section, a launch operator must perform the preflight wind weighting and other preflight safety operations required by §§ 417.125, 417.233, and appendix C of this part.
              [Docket No. FAA-2000-7953, 71 FR 50537, Aug. 25, 2006, as amended by Amdt. No. 417-5, 81 FR 59439, Aug. 30, 2016]
            
            
              § 417.123
              Computing systems and software.
              (a) A launch operator must document a system safety process that identifies the hazards and assesses the risks to public health and safety and the safety of property related to computing systems and software.
              (b) A launch operator must identify all safety-critical functions associated with its computing systems and software. Safety-critical computing system and software functions must include the following:
              (1) Software used to control or monitor safety-critical systems.

              (6) Processor-interrupt software associated with previously designated safety-critical computer system functions.
              (7) Software that computes safety-critical data.
              (8) Software that accesses safety-critical data.
              (9) Software used for wind weighting.
              
              (c) A launch operator must conduct computing system and software hazard analyses for the integrated system.
              (d) A launch operator must develop and implement computing system and software validation and verification plans.

              (1) Coding standards used;
              (2) Configuration control;
              (3) Programmable logic controllers;
              (4) Policy on use of any commercial-off-the-shelf software; and
              (5) Policy on software reuse.
            
            
              § 417.125
              Launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle.
              (a) Applicability. This section applies only to a launch operator conducting a launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle.
              (b) Need for flight safety system. A launch operator must launch an unguided suborbital launch vehicle with a flight safety system in accordance with § 417.107 (a) and subpart D of this part unless one of the following exceptions applies:
              (1) The unguided suborbital launch vehicle, including any component or payload, does not have sufficient energy to reach any populated area in any direction from the launch point; or
              (2) A launch operator demonstrates through the licensing process that the launch will be conducted using a wind weighting safety system that meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) Wind weighting safety system. A launch operator's wind weighting safety system must consist of equipment, procedures, analysis and personnel functions used to determine the launcher elevation and azimuth settings that correct for the windcocking and wind drift that an unguided suborbital launch vehicle will experience during flight due to wind effects. The launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle that uses a wind weighting safety system must meet the following requirements:
              (1) The unguided suborbital launch vehicle must not contain a guidance or directional control system.
              (2) The launcher azimuth and elevation settings must be wind weighted to correct for the effects of wind conditions at the time of flight to provide a safe impact location. A launch operator must conduct the launch in accordance with the wind weighting analysis requirements and methods of § 417.233 and appendix C of this part.
              (3) A launch operator must use a launcher elevation angle setting that ensures the rocket will not fly uprange. A launch operator must set the launcher elevation angle in accordance with the following:
              (i) The nominal launcher elevation angle must not exceed 85°. The wind corrected launcher elevation setting must not exceed 86°.
              (ii) For an unproven unguided suborbital launch vehicle, the nominal launcher elevation angle must not exceed 80°. The wind corrected launcher elevation setting must not exceed 84°. A proven unguided suborbital launch vehicle is one that has demonstrated, by two or more launches, that flight performance errors are within all the three-sigma dispersion parameters modeled in the wind weighting safety system.
              (d) Public risk criteria. A launch operator must conduct the launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle in accordance with the public risk criteria of § 417.107(b). The risk to the public determined prior to the day of flight must satisfy the public risk criteria for the area defined by the range of nominal launch azimuths. A launch operator must not initiate flight until a launch operator has verified that the wind drifted impacts of all planned impacts and their five-sigma dispersion areas satisfy the public risk criteria after wind weighting on the day of flight.
              (e) Stability. An unguided suborbital launch vehicle, in all configurations, must be stable in flexible body to 1.5 calibers and rigid body to 2.0 calibers throughout each stage of powered flight. A caliber, for a rocket configuration, is defined as the distance between the center of pressure and the center of gravity divided by the largest frontal diameter of the rocket configuration.
              
              (f) Tracking. A launch operator must track the flight of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle. The tracking system must provide data to determine the actual impact locations of all stages and components, to verify the effectiveness of a launch operator's wind weighting safety system, and to obtain rocket performance data for comparison with the preflight performance predictions.
              (g) Post-launch review. A launch operator must ensure that the post-launch report required by § 417.25 includes:
              (1) Actual impact location of all impacting stages and each impacting component.
              (2) A comparison of actual and predicted nominal performance.
              (3) Investigation results of any launch anomaly. If flight performance deviates by more than a three-sigma dispersion from the nominal trajectory, a launch operator must conduct an investigation to determine the cause of the rocket's deviation from normal flight and take corrective action before the next launch. A launch operator must file any corrective actions with the FAA as a request for license modification before the next launch in accordance with § 417.11.
            
            
              § 417.127
              Unique safety policies, requirements and practices.
              For each launch, a launch operator must review operations, system designs, analysis, and testing, and identify any unique hazards not otherwise addressed by this part. A launch operator must implement any unique safety policy, requirement, or practice needed to protect the public from the unique hazard. A launch operator must demonstrate through the licensing process that any unique safety policy, requirement, or practice ensures the safety of the public. For any change to a unique safety policy, requirement, or practice, with the exception of a launch specific update, the launch operator must file a request for license modification as required by § 417.11. The FAA may identify and impose a unique safety policy, requirement, or practice as needed to protect the public.
            
            
              § 417.129
              Safety at end of launch.
              A launch operator must ensure for any proposed launch that for all launch vehicle stages or components that reach Earth orbit—
              (a) There is no unplanned physical contact between the vehicle or any of its components and the payload after payload separation;
              (b) Debris generation does not result from the conversion of energy sources into energy that fragments the vehicle or its components. Energy sources include chemical, pressure, and kinetic energy; and
              (c) Stored energy is removed by depleting residual fuel and leaving all fuel line valves open, venting any pressurized system, leaving all batteries in a permanent discharge state, and removing any remaining source of stored energy.
            
            
              §§ 417.130-417.200
              [Reserved]
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Flight Safety Analysis
            
              § 417.201
              Scope and applicability.
              (a) This subpart contains requirements for performing the flight safety analysis required by § 417.107(f).
              (b) The flight safety analysis requirements of this subpart apply to the flight of any launch vehicle that must use a flight safety system as required by § 417.107(a), except as permitted by paragraph (d) of this section.
              (c) The flight safety analysis requirements of §§ 417.203, 417.205, 417.207, 417.211, 417.223, 417.224, 417.225, 417.227, 417.229, 417.231, and 417.233 apply to the flight of any unguided suborbital launch vehicle that uses a wind-weighting safety system. Appendices B, C, and I of this part also apply.
              (d) For any alternative flight safety system approved by the FAA under § 417.301(b), the FAA will determine during the licensing process which of the analyses required by this subpart apply.
            
            
              § 417.203
              Compliance.
              (a) General. A launch operator's flight safety analysis must satisfy the performance requirements of this subpart. The flight safety analysis must also meet the requirements for methods of analysis contained in appendices A and B of this part for a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system and appendices B and C of this part for an unguided suborbital launch vehicle that uses a wind-weighting safety system except as otherwise permitted by this section. A flight safety analysis for a launch may rely on an earlier analysis from an identical or similar launch if the analysis still applies to the later launch.
              (b) Method of analysis. (1) For each launch, a launch operator's flight safety analysis must use—
              (i) A method approved by the FAA during the licensing process;
              (ii) A method approved as a license modification by the FAA; or,
              (iii) If the launch takes place from a Federal launch range, a method approved as part of the FAA's launch site safety assessment of the Federal range's processes.
              (2) Appendix A of this part contains requirements that apply to all methods of flight safety analysis. A licensee must notify the FAA for any change to the flight safety analysis method. A licensee must file any material change with the FAA as a request for license modification before the launch to which the proposed change would apply. Section 417.11 contains requirements governing a license modification.
              (c) Alternate analysis method. The FAA will approve an alternate flight safety analysis method if a launch operator demonstrates, in accordance with § 406.3(b), that its proposed analysis method provides an equivalent level of fidelity to that required by this subpart. A launch operator must demonstrate that an alternate flight safety analysis method is based on accurate data and scientific principles and is statistically valid. The FAA will not find a launch operator's application for a license or license modification sufficiently complete to begin review under § 413.11 of this chapter until the FAA approves the alternate flight safety analysis method.
              (d) Analyses performed by a Federal launch range. This provision applies to all sections of this subpart. The FAA will accept a flight safety analysis used by a Federal launch range without need for further demonstration of compliance to the FAA, if:
              (1) A launch operator has contracted with a Federal launch range for the provision of flight safety analysis; and
              (2) The FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the range's analysis methods satisfy the requirements of this subpart. In this case, the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's analysis as that of a launch operator.
              (e) Analysis products. For a licensed launch that does not satisfy paragraph (d) of this section, a launch operator must demonstrate to the FAA compliance with the requirements of this subpart, and must include in its demonstration the analysis products required by part 415 subpart F of this chapter, part 417 subpart A, and appendices A, B, C, and I of this part, depending on whether the launch vehicle uses a flight safety system or a wind-weighting safety system.
            
            
              § 417.205
              General.
              (a) Public risk management. A flight safety analysis must demonstrate that a launch operator will, for each launch, control the risk to the public from hazards associated with normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight. The analysis must employ risk assessment, hazard isolation, or a combination of risk assessment and partial isolation of the hazards, to demonstrate control of the risk to the public.
              (1) Risk assessment. When demonstrating control of risk through risk assessment, the analysis must demonstrate that any risk to the public satisfies the public risk criteria of § 417.107(b). The analysis must account for the variability associated with:
              (i) Each source of a hazard during flight;
              (ii) Normal flight and each failure response mode of the launch vehicle;
              (iii) Each external and launch vehicle flight environment;
              (iv) Populations potentially exposed to the flight; and

              (v) The performance of any flight safety system, including time delays associated with the system.
              
              (2) Hazard isolation. When demonstrating control of risk through hazard isolation, the analysis must establish the geographical areas from which the public must be excluded during flight and any operational controls needed to isolate all hazards from the public.
              (3) Combination of risk assessment and partial isolation of hazards. When demonstrating control of risk through a combination of risk assessment and partial isolation of the hazards from the public, the analysis must demonstrate that the residual public risk due to any hazard not isolated from the public under paragraph (a)(2) of this section satisfies the public risk criteria of § 417.107(b).
              (b) Dependent analyses. Because some analyses required by this subpart are inherently dependent on one another, the data output of any one analysis must be compatible in form and content with the data input requirements of any other analysis that depends on that output. Figure 417.205-1 illustrates the flight safety analyses that might be performed for a launch flown with a flight safety system and the typical dependencies that might exist among the analyses.

              § 417.207
              Trajectory analysis.
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a trajectory analysis that establishes:
              (1) For any time after lift-off, the limits of a launch vehicle's normal flight, as defined by the nominal trajectory and potential three-sigma trajectory dispersions about the nominal trajectory.
              (2) A fuel exhaustion trajectory that produces instantaneous impact points with the greatest range for any given time after liftoff for any stage that has the potential to impact the Earth and does not burn to propellant depletion before a programmed thrust termination.
              (3) For launch vehicles flown with a flight safety system, a straight-up trajectory for any time after lift-off until the straight-up time that would result if the launch vehicle malfunctioned and flew in a vertical or near vertical direction above the launch point.
              (b) Trajectory model. A final trajectory analysis must use a six-degree of freedom trajectory model to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) Wind effects. A trajectory analysis must account for all wind effects, including profiles of winds that are no less severe than the worst wind conditions under which flight might be attempted, and must account for uncertainty in the wind conditions.
            
            
              § 417.209
              Malfunction turn analysis.
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a malfunction turn analysis that establishes the launch vehicle's turning capability in the event of a malfunction during flight. A malfunction turn analysis must account for each cause of a malfunction turn, such as thrust vector offsets or nozzle burn-through. For each cause of a malfunction turn, the analysis must establish the launch vehicle's turning capability using a set of turn curves. The analysis must account for:
              (1) All trajectory times during the thrusting phases of flight.
              (2) When a malfunction begins to cause each turn throughout the thrusting phases of flight. The analysis must account for trajectory time intervals between malfunction turn start times that are sufficient to establish flight safety limits and hazard areas that are smooth and continuous.
              (3) The relative probability of occurrence of each malfunction turn of which the launch vehicle is capable.
              (4) The time, as a single value or a probability time distribution, when each malfunction turn will terminate due to vehicle breakup.
              (5) What terminates each malfunction turn, such as, aerodynamic breakup or inertial breakup.
              (6) The launch vehicle's turning behavior from the time when a malfunction begins to cause a turn until aerodynamic breakup, inertial breakup, or ground impact. The analysis must account for trajectory time intervals during the malfunction turn that are sufficient to establish turn curves that are smooth and continuous.
              (7) For each malfunction turn, the launch vehicle velocity vector turn angle from the nominal launch vehicle velocity vector.
              (8) For each malfunction turn, the launch vehicle velocity turn magnitude from the nominal velocity magnitude that corresponds to the velocity vector turn angle.
              (9) For each malfunction turn, the orientation of the launch vehicle longitudinal axis measured relative to the nominal launch vehicle longitudinal axis or Earth relative velocity vector at the start of the turn.
              (b) Set of turn curves for each malfunction turn cause. For each cause of a malfunction turn, the analysis must establish a set of turn curves that satisfies paragraph (a) of this section and must establish the associated envelope of the set of turn curves. Each set of turn curves must describe the variation in the malfunction turn characteristics for each cause of a turn. The envelope of each set of curves must define the limits of the launch vehicle's malfunction turn behavior for each cause of a malfunction turn. For each malfunction turn envelope, the analysis must establish the launch vehicle velocity vector turn angle from the nominal launch vehicle velocity vector. For each malfunction turn envelope, the analysis must establish the vehicle velocity turn magnitude from the nominal velocity magnitude that corresponds to the velocity vector turn angle envelope.
            
            
              § 417.211
              Debris analysis.
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a debris analysis. For an orbital or suborbital launch, a debris analysis must identify the inert, explosive, and other hazardous launch vehicle debris that results from normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight.
              (b) Launch vehicle breakup. A debris analysis must account for each cause of launch vehicle breakup, including at a minimum:
              (1) Any flight termination system activation;
              (2) Launch vehicle explosion;
              (3) Aerodynamic loads;
              (4) Inertial loads;
              (5) Atmospheric reentry heating; and
              (6) Impact of intact vehicle.
              (c) Debris fragment lists. A debris analysis must produce lists of debris fragments for each cause of breakup and any planned jettison of debris, launch vehicle components, or payload. The lists must account for all launch vehicle debris fragments, individually or in groupings of fragments whose characteristics are similar enough to be described by a single set of characteristics. The debris lists must describe the physical, aerodynamic, and harmful characteristics of each debris fragment, including at a minimum:
              (1) Origin on the vehicle, by vehicle stage or component, from which each fragment originated;
              (2) Whether it is inert or explosive;
              (3) Weight, dimensions, and shape;
              (4) Lift and drag characteristics;
              (5) Properties of the incremental velocity distribution imparted by breakup; and
              (6) Axial, transverse, and tumbling area.
            
            
              § 417.213
              Flight safety limits analysis.
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must identify the location of populated or other protected areas, and establish flight safety limits that define when a flight safety system must terminate a launch vehicle's flight to prevent the hazardous effects of the resulting debris impacts from reaching any populated or other protected area and ensure that the launch satisfies the public risk criteria of § 417.107(b).
              (b) Flight safety limits. The analysis must establish flight safety limits for use in establishing flight termination rules. Section 417.113(c) contains requirements for flight termination rules. The flight safety limits must account for all temporal and geometric extents on the Earth's surface of a launch vehicle's hazardous debris impact dispersion resulting from any planned or unplanned event for all times during flight. Flight safety limits must account for all potential contributions to the debris impact dispersions, including at a minimum:
              (1) All time delays, as established by the time delay analysis of § 417.221;
              (2) Residual thrust remaining after flight termination implementation or vehicle breakup due to aerodynamic and inertial loads;
              (3) All wind effects;
              (4) Velocity imparted to vehicle fragments by breakup;
              (5) All lift and drag forces on the malfunctioning vehicle and falling debris;
              (6) All launch vehicle guidance and performance errors;
              (7) All launch vehicle malfunction turn capabilities; and
              (8) Any uncertainty due to map errors and launch vehicle tracking errors.
              (c) Gates. If a launch involves flight over any populated or other protected area, the flight safety analysis must establish a gate as required by §§ 417.217 and 417.218.
              (d) Designated debris impact limits. The analysis must establish designated impact limit lines to bound the area where debris with a ballistic coefficient of three or more is allowed to impact if the flight safety system functions properly.
            
            
              § 417.215
              Straight-up time analysis.

              A flight safety analysis must establish the straight-up time for a launch for use as a flight termination rule. Section 417.113(c) contains requirements for flight termination rules. The analysis must establish the straight-up time as the latest time after liftoff, assuming a launch vehicle malfunctioned and flew in a vertical or near vertical direction above the launch point, at which activation of the launch vehicle's flight termination system or breakup of the launch vehicle would not cause hazardous debris or critical overpressure to affect any populated or other protected area.
            
            
              § 417.217
              Overflight gate analysis.
              For a launch that involves flight over a populated or other protected area, the flight safety analysis must include an overflight gate analysis. The analysis must establish the portion of a flight safety limit, a gate, through which a normally performing launch vehicle's tracking icon will be allowed to proceed. A tracking icon must enable the flight safety crew to determine whether the launch vehicle's flight is in compliance with the flight safety rules established under § 417.113. When establishing that portion of a flight safety limit, the analysis must demonstrate that the launch vehicle flight satisfies the flight safety requirements of § 417.107.
            
            
              § 417.218
              Hold-and-resume gate analysis.
              (a) For a launch that involves overflight or near overflight of a populated or otherwise protected area prior to the planned safe flight state calculated as required by § 417.219, the flight safety analysis must construct a hold-and-resume gate for each populated or otherwise protected area. After a vehicle's tracking icon crosses a hold-and-resume gate, flight termination must occur as required by sections 417.113(d)(6).
              (b) The hold-and-resume gate analysis must account for:
              (1) Overflight of a wholly contained populated or otherwise protected area. A hold-and-resume gate must be a closed, continuous contour that encompasses any populated or otherwise protected area located wholly within the impact limit lines. The hold-and-resume gate must encompass a populated or otherwise protected area such that flight termination or breakup of the launch vehicle while the tracking icon is outside the gate would not cause hazardous debris or overpressure to endanger the populated or otherwise protected area.
              (2) Overflight of an uncontained populated or otherwise protected area. A hold-and-resume gate must be a closed, continuous contour that encompasses any area in which flight termination is allowed to occur. The hold-and-resume gate must encompass all hazard areas such that flight termination or breakup of the launch vehicle while the vehicle's tracking icon is inside the gate would not cause hazardous debris or critical overpressure to endanger any populated or otherwise protected area.
            
            
              § 417.219
              Data loss flight time and planned safe flight state analyses.
              (a) General. For each launch, a flight safety analysis must establish data loss flight times, as identified by paragraph (b) of this section, and a planned safe flight state to establish each flight termination rule that applies when launch vehicle tracking data is not available for use by the flight safety crew. Section 417.113(d) contains requirements for flight termination rules.
              (b) Data loss flight times. A flight safety analysis must establish the shortest elapsed thrusting time during which a launch vehicle can move from normal flight to a condition where the launch vehicle's hazardous debris impact dispersion extends to any protected area as a data loss flight time. The analysis must establish a data loss flight time for all times along the nominal trajectory from liftoff through that point during nominal flight when the minimum elapsed thrusting time is no greater than the time it would take for a normal vehicle to reach the overflight gate, or the planned safe flight state established under paragraph (c) of this section, whichever occurs earlier.
              (c) Planned safe flight state. For a launch vehicle that performs normally during all portions of flight, the planned safe flight state is the point during the nominal flight of a launch vehicle where:
              (1) No launch vehicle component, debris, or hazard can impact or affect a populated or otherwise protected area for the remainder of the launch;
              (2) The launch vehicle achieves orbital insertion; or

              (3) The launch vehicle's state vector reaches a state where the absence of a flight safety system would not significantly increase the accumulated risk from debris impacts and maintains positive flight safety system control to the maximum extent feasible.
            
            
              § 417.221
              Time delay analysis.
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a time delay analysis that establishes the mean elapsed time between the violation of a flight termination rule and the time when the flight safety system is capable of terminating flight for use in establishing flight safety limits as required by § 417.213.
              (b) Analysis constraints. A time delay analyses must determine a time delay distribution that accounts for the following:
              (1) The variance of all time delays for each potential failure scenario, including but not limited to, the range of malfunction turn characteristics and the time of flight when the malfunction occurs;
              (2) A flight safety official's decision and reaction time, including variation in human response time; and
              (3) Flight termination hardware and software delays including all delays inherent in:
              (i) Tracking systems;
              (ii) Data processing systems, including all filter delays;
              (iii) Display systems;
              (iv) Command control systems; and
              (v) Flight termination systems.
            
            
              § 417.223
              Flight hazard area analysis.
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a flight hazard area analysis that identifies any regions of land, sea, or air that must be surveyed, publicized, controlled, or evacuated in order to control the risk to the public from debris impact hazards. The risk management requirements of § 417.205(a) apply. The analysis must account for, at a minimum:
              (1) All trajectory times from liftoff to the planned safe flight state of § 417.219(c), including each planned impact, for an orbital launch, and through final impact for a suborbital launch;
              (2) Regions of land potentially exposed to debris resulting from normal flight events and events resulting from any potential malfunction;
              (3) Regions of sea and air potentially exposed to debris from normal flight events, including planned impacts;
              (4) In the vicinity of the launch site, any waterborne vessels, populated offshore structures, or aircraft exposed to debris from events resulting from any potential abnormal flight events, including launch vehicle malfunction;
              (5) Any operational controls implemented to control risk to the public from debris hazards;
              (6) Debris identified by the debris analysis of § 417.211; and
              (7) All launch vehicle trajectory dispersion effects in the surface impact domain.
              (b) Public notices. A flight hazard areas analysis must establish the ship hazard areas for notices to mariners that encompass the three-sigma impact dispersion area for each planned debris impact. A flight hazard areas analysis must establish the aircraft hazard areas for notices to airmen that encompass the 3-sigma impact dispersion volume for each planned debris impact. Section 417.121(e) contains procedural requirements for issuing notices to mariners and airmen.
            
            
              § 417.224
              Probability of failure analysis.
              (a) General. All flight safety analyses for a launch, regardless of hazard or phase of flight, must account for launch vehicle failure probability in a consistent manner. A launch vehicle failure probability estimate must use accurate data, scientific principles, and a method that is statistically or probabilistically valid. For a launch vehicle with fewer than two flights, the failure probability estimate must account for the outcome of all previous launches of vehicles developed and launched in similar circumstances. For a launch vehicle with two or more flights, launch vehicle failure probability estimates must account for the outcomes of all previous flights of the vehicle in a statistically valid manner.
              (b) Failure. For flight safety analysis purposes, a failure occurs when a launch vehicle does not complete any phase of normal flight or when any anomalous condition exhibits the potential for a stage or its debris to impact the Earth or reenter the atmosphere during the mission or any future mission of similar launch vehicle capability. Also, either a launch incident or launch accident constitutes a failure.
              (c) Previous flight. For flight analysis purposes, flight begins at a time in which a launch vehicle normally or inadvertently lifts off from a launch platform. Lift-off occurs with any motion of the launch vehicle with respect to the launch platform.
            
            
              § 417.225
              Debris risk analysis.
              A flight safety analysis must demonstrate that the risk to the public potentially exposed to inert and explosive debris hazards from any one flight of a launch vehicle satisfies the public risk criterion of § 417.107(b) for debris. A debris risk analysis must account for risk to populations on land, including regions of launch vehicle flight following passage through any gate in a flight safety limit established as required by § 417.217. A debris risk analysis must account for any potential casualties to the public as required by the debris thresholds and requirements of § 417.107(c).
            
            
              § 417.227
              Toxic release hazard analysis.
              A flight safety analysis must establish flight commit criteria that protect the public from any hazard associated with toxic release and demonstrate compliance with the public risk criterion of § 417.107(b). The analysis must account for any toxic release that will occur during the proposed flight of a launch vehicle or that would occur in the event of a flight mishap. The analysis must account for any operational constraints and emergency procedures that provide protection from toxic release. The analysis must account for all members of the public that may be exposed to the toxic release, including all members of the public on land and on any waterborne vessels, populated offshore structures, and aircraft that are not operated in direct support of the launch.
            
            
              § 417.229
              Far-field overpressure blast effects analysis.
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must establish flight commit criteria that protect the public from any hazard associated with far field blast overpressure effects due to potential explosions during launch vehicle flight and demonstrate compliance with the public risk criterion of § 417.107(b).
              (b) Analysis constraints. The analysis must account for:
              (1) The potential for distant focus overpressure or overpressure enhancement given current meteorological conditions and terrain characteristics;
              (2) The potential for broken windows due to peak incident overpressures below 1.0 psi and related casualties;
              (3) The explosive capability of the launch vehicle at impact and at altitude and potential explosions resulting from debris impacts, including the potential for mixing of liquid propellants;
              (4) Characteristics of the launch vehicle flight and the surroundings that would affect the population's susceptibility to injury, such as, shelter types and time of day of the proposed launch;
              (5) Characteristics of the potentially affected windows, including their size, location, orientation, glazing material, and condition; and
              (6) The hazard characteristics of the potential glass shards, such as falling from upper building stories or being propelled into or out of a shelter toward potentially occupied spaces.
            
            
              § 417.231
              Collision avoidance analysis.
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a collision avoidance analysis that establishes each launch wait in a planned launch window during which a launch operator must not initiate flight, in order to protect any maned or mannable orbiting object. A launch operator must account for uncertainties associated with launch vehicle performance and timing and ensure that any calculated launch waits incorporate all additional time periods associated with such uncertainties. A launch operator must implement any launch waits as flight commit criteria according to § 417.113(c).
              (b) Orbital launch. For an orbital launch, the analysis must establish any launch waits needed to ensure that the launch vehicle, any jettisoned components, and its payload do not pass closer than 200 kilometers to a manned or mannable orbiting object during ascent to initial orbital insertion through at least one complete orbit.
              (c) Suborbital launch. For a suborbital launch, the analysis must establish any launch waits needed to ensure that the launch vehicle, any jettisoned components, and any payload do not pass closer than 200 kilometers to a manned or mannable orbital object throughout the flight.
              (d) Analysis not required. A collision avoidance analysis is not required if the maximum altitude attainable by a launch operator's unguided suborbital launch vehicle is less than the altitude of the lowest manned or mannable orbiting object. The maximum altitude attainable must be obtained using an optimized trajectory, assuming 3-sigma maximum performance.

              § 417.233
              Analysis for an unguided suborbital launch vehicle flown with a wind weighting safety system.
              For each launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle flown with a wind weighting safety system, in addition to the other requirements in this subpart outlined in § 417.201(c), the flight safety analysis must:
              (a) Establish flight commit criteria and other launch safety rules that a launch operator must implement to control the risk to the public from potential adverse effects resulting from normal and malfunctioning flight;
              (b) Establish any wind constraints under which launch may occur; and
              (c) Include a wind weighting analysis that establishes the launcher azimuth and elevation settings that correct for the windcocking and wind-drift effects on the unguided suborbital launch vehicle.
            
          
          
            Subpart D—Flight Safety System
            
              § 417.301
              General.
              (a) Applicability. This subpart applies to any flight safety system that a launch operator uses. The requirements of § 417.107(a) define when a launch operator must use a flight safety system. A launch operator must ensure that its flight safety system satisfies all the requirements of this subpart, including the referenced appendices. Paragraph (b) of this section provides an exception to this.
              (b) Alternate flight safety system. A flight safety system need not satisfy one or more of the requirements of this subpart for a launch if a launch operator demonstrates, in accordance with § 406.3(b), that the launch achieves an equivalent level of safety as a launch that satisfies all the requirements of this part. The flight safety system must undergo analysis and testing that is comparable to that required by this part to demonstrate that the system's reliability to perform each intended function is comparable to that required by this subpart.
              (c) Functions, subsystems, and components. When initiated in the event of a launch vehicle failure, a flight safety system must prevent any launch vehicle hazard, including any payload hazard, from reaching a populated or other protected area. A flight safety system must consist of all of the following:
              (1) A flight termination system that satisfies appendices D, E, and F of this part;
              (2) A command control system that satisfies §§ 417.303 and 417.305;
              (3) Each support system required by § 417.307; and
              (4) The functions of any personnel who operate flight safety system hardware or software including a flight safety crew that satisfies § 417.311.
              (d) Compliance—(1) Non-Federal launch site. For launch from a non-Federal launch site, any flight safety system, including all components, must:
              (i) Comply with a launch operator's flight safety system compliance matrix of § 415.127(g) that accounts for all the design, installation, and monitoring requirements of this subpart, including the referenced appendices; and

              (ii) Comply with a launch operator's testing compliance matrix of § 415.129(b) that accounts for all the test requirements of this subpart, including the referenced appendices.
              
              (2) Federal launch range. This provision applies to all sections of this subpart. The FAA will accept a flight safety system used or approved on a Federal launch range without need for further demonstration of compliance to the FAA if:
              (i) A launch operator has contracted with a Federal launch range for the provision of flight safety system property and services; and
              (ii) The FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the Federal launch range's flight safety system property and services satisfy the requirements of this subpart. In this case, the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's flight safety system property and services as that of a launch operator.

              § 417.303
              Command control system requirements.
              (a) General. When initiated by a flight safety official, a command control system must transmit a command signal that has the radio frequency characteristics and power needed for receipt of the signal by the onboard vehicle flight termination system. A command control system must include all of the following:
              (1) All flight termination system activation switches;
              (2) All intermediate equipment, linkages, and software;
              (3) Any auxiliary stations;
              (4) Each command transmitter and transmitting antenna; and
              (5) All support equipment that is critical for reliable operation, such as power, communications, and air conditioning systems.
              (b) Performance specifications. A command control system and each subsystem, component, and part that can affect the reliability of a component must have written performance specifications that demonstrate, and contain the details of, how each satisfies the requirements of this section.
              (c) Reliability prediction. A command control system must have a predicted reliability of 0.999 at the 95 percent confidence level when operating, starting with completion of the preflight testing and system verification of § 417.305(c) through initiation of flight and until the planned safe flight state for each launch. Any demonstration of the system's predicted reliability must satisfy § 417.309(b).
              (d) Fault tolerance. A command control system must not contain any single-failure-point that, upon failure, would inhibit the required functioning of the system or cause the transmission of an undesired flight termination message. A command control system's design must ensure that the probability of transmitting an undesired or inadvertent command during flight is less than 1 × 10−7.
              
              (e) Configuration control. A command control system must undergo configuration control to ensure its reliability and compatibility with the flight termination system used for each launch.
              (f) Electromagnetic interference. Each command control system component must function within the electromagnetic environment to which it is exposed. A command control system must include protection to prevent interference from inhibiting the required functioning of the system or causing the transmission of an undesired or inadvertent flight termination command. Any susceptible remote control data processing or transmitting system that is part of the command control system must prevent electromagnetic interference.
              (g) Command transmitter failover. A command control system must include independent, redundant transmitter systems that automatically switch, or “fail-over,” from a primary transmitter to a secondary transmitter when a condition exists that indicates potential failure of the primary transmitter. The switch must be automatic and provide all the same command control system capabilities through the secondary transmitter system. The secondary transmitter system must respond to any transmitter system configuration and radio message orders established for the launch. The fail-over criteria that trigger automatic switching from the primary transmitter to the secondary transmitter must account for each of the following transmitter performance parameters and failure indicators:
              (1) Low transmitter power;
              (2) Center frequency shift;
              (3) Out of tolerance tone frequency;
              (4) Out of tolerance message timing;
              (5) Loss of communication between central control and transmitter site;
              (6) Central control commanded status and site status disagree;
              (7) Transmitter site fails to respond to a configuration or radiation order within a specified period of time; and
              (8) For a tone-based system, tone deviation and tone imbalance.
              (h) Switching between transmitter systems. Any manual or automatic switching between transmitter systems, including fail-over, must not result in the radio carrier being off the air long enough for any command destruct system to be captured by an unauthorized transmitter. The time the radio carrier is off the air must account for any loss of carrier and any simultaneous multiple radio carrier transmissions from two transmitter sites during switching.
              (i) Radio carrier. For each launch, a command control system must provide all of the following:
              (1) The radio frequency signal and radiated power density that each command destruct system needs to activate during flight;
              (2) The 12-dB power density margin required by section D417.9(d) of appendix D of this part under nominal conditions; and
              (3) A 6-dB power density margin under worst-case conditions.
              (j) Command control system monitoring and control. A command control system must provide for monitoring and control of the system from the flight safety system displays and controls required by § 417.307(f), including real-time selection of a transmitter, transmitter site, communication circuits, and antenna configuration.
              (k) Command transmitter system. For each launch, a command transmitter system must:
              (1) Transmit signals that are compatible with any command destruct system's radio frequency receiving system of section D417.25 and command receiver decoder of section D417.29 of appendix D of this part;
              (2) Ensure that all arm and destruct commands transmitted to a flight termination system have priority over any other commands transmitted;
              (3) Employ an authorized radio carrier frequency and bandwidth with a guard band that provides the radio frequency separation needed to ensure that the system does not interfere with any other flight safety system that is required to operate at the same time;
              (4) Transmit an output bandwidth that is consistent with the signal spectrum power used in the link analysis of § 417.309(f); and
              (5) Not transmit other frequencies that could degrade the airborne flight termination system's performance.
              (l) Command control system antennas. A command control system antenna or antenna system must satisfy all of the following:
              (1) The antenna system must provide two or more command signals to any command destruct system throughout normal flight and in the event of a launch vehicle failure regardless of launch vehicle orientation;
              (2) Each antenna beam-width must:
              (i) Allow for complete transmission of the command destruct sequence of signal tones before a malfunctioning launch vehicle can exit the 3-dB point of the antenna pattern;
              (ii) When the vehicle is centered in the antenna pattern at the beginning of the malfunction, account for the launch vehicle's malfunction turn capability determined by the analysis of § 417.209, the data loss flight times of § 417.219, and the time delay of § 417.221.
              (iii) Encompass the boundaries of normal flight for the portion of flight that the antenna is scheduled to support; and
              (iv) Account for any error associated with launch vehicle tracking and pointing of the antenna;
              (3) The location of each antenna must provide for an unobstructed line of site between the antenna and the launch vehicle;

              (4) The antenna system must provide a continuous omni-directional radio carrier pattern that covers the launch vehicle's flight from the launch point to no less than an altitude of 50,000 feet above sea level, unless the system uses a steerable antenna that satisfies paragraphs (l)(1) and (2) of this section for the worst-case launch vehicle malfunction that could occur during that portion of flight;
              (5) An antenna must radiate circularly polarized radio waves that are compatible with the flight termination system antennas on the launch vehicle; and
              (6) Any steerable antenna must allow for control of the antenna manually at the antenna site or by remote slaving data from a launch vehicle tracking source. A steerable antenna's positioning lag, accuracy, and slew rates must allow for tracking a nominally performing launch vehicle within one half of the antenna's beam-width and for tracking a malfunctioning launch vehicle to satisfy paragraph (l)(2) of this section.

              § 417.305
              Command control system testing.
              (a) General. (1) A command control system, including its subsystems and components must undergo the acceptance testing of paragraph (b) of this section when new or modified. For each launch, a command control system must undergo the preflight testing of paragraph (c) of this section.
              (2) Each acceptance and preflight test must follow a written test plan that specifies the procedures and test parameters for the test and the testing sequence. A test plan must include instructions on how to handle procedural deviations and how to react to test failures.
              (3) If hardware or software is redesigned or replaced with a different hardware or software that is not identical to the original, the system must undergo all acceptance testing and analysis with the new hardware or software and all preflight testing for each launch with the new hardware or software.
              (4) After a command control system passes all acceptance tests, if a component is replaced with an identical component, the system must undergo testing to ensure that the new component is installed properly and is operational.
              (b) Acceptance testing. (1) All new or modified command control system hardware and software must undergo acceptance testing to verify that the system satisfies the requirements of § 417.303.
              (2) Acceptance testing must include functional testing, system interface validation testing, and integrated system-wide validation testing.
              (3) Each acceptance test must measure the performance parameters that demonstrate whether the requirements of § 417.303 are satisfied.
              (4) Any computing system, software, or firmware that performs a software safety critical function must undergo validation testing and satisfy § 417.123. If command control system hardware interfaces with software, the interface must undergo validation testing.
              (c) Preflight testing—(1) General. For each launch, a command control system must undergo preflight testing to verify that the system satisfies the requirements of § 417.303 for the launch.
              (2) Coordinated command control system and flight termination system testing. For each launch, a command control system must undergo preflight testing during the preflight testing of the associated flight termination system under section E417.41 of appendix E of this part.
              (3) Command transmitter system carrier switching tests. A command transmitter system must undergo a test of its carrier switching system no earlier than 24 hours before a scheduled flight. The test must satisfy all of the following:
              (i) Automatic carrier switching. For any automatic carrier switching system, the test must verify that the switching algorithm selects and enables the proper transmitter site for each portion of the planned flight; and
              (ii) Manual carrier switching. For any manual carrier switching, the test must verify that the flight safety system crew can select and enable each transmitter site planned to support the launch.
              (4) Independent radio frequency open loop verification tests. A command control system must undergo an open loop end-to-end verification test for each launch as close to the planned flight as operationally feasible and after any modification to the system or break in the system configuration. The test must:
              (i) Verify the performance of each element of the system from the flight safety system displays and controls to each command transmitter site;
              (ii) Measure all system performance parameters received and transmitted using measuring equipment that does not physically interface with any elements of the operational command control system;
              (iii) Verify the performance of each flight safety system display and control and remote command transmitter site combination by repeating all measurements for each combination, for all strings and all operational configurations of cross-strapped equipment; and
              (iv) Verify that all critical command control system performance parameters satisfy all their performance specifications. These parameters must include:
              (A) Transmitter power output;
              (B) Center frequency stability;
              (C) Tone deviation;

              (E) Message timing;
              (F) Status of each communication circuit between the flight safety system display and controls and any supporting command transmitter sites;
              (G) Status agreement between the flight safety system display and controls and each and any supporting command transmitter sites;
              (H) Fail-over conditions;
              (I) Tone balance; and
              (J) Time delay from initiation of a command at each flight safety system control to transmitter output of the command signal.
              (d) Test reports. If a Federal launch range oversees the safety of a launch, the range's requirements are consistent with this subpart, and the range provides and tests the command control system, a launch operator need only obtain the range's verification that the system satisfies all the test requirements. For any other case a launch operator must prepare or obtain one or more written reports that:
              (1) Verify that the command control system satisfies all the test requirements;
              (2) Describe all command control system test results and test conditions;
              (3) Describe any analysis performed instead of testing;

              (3) All ground tracking systems and components must be compatible with any tracking system components onboard the launch vehicle.
              
              (4) If a tracking system uses radar as one of the independent tracking sources, the system must:
              (i) Include a tracking beacon onboard the launch vehicle; or
              (ii) If the system relies on skin tracking, it must maintain a tracking margin of no less than 6 dB above noise throughout the period of flight that the radar is used. The flight safety limits must account for the larger tracking errors associated with skin tracking.
              (5) The tracking system must provide real-time data to the flight safety data processing, display, and recording system required by paragraph (e) of this section.
              (6) For each launch, each tracking source must undergo validation of its accuracy. For each stage of flight that a launch vehicle guidance system is used as a tracking source, a tracking source that is independent of any system used to aid the guidance system must validate the guidance system data before the data is used in the flight termination decision process.
              (7) The launch vehicle tracking error from all sources, including data latency and any possible gaps or dropouts in tracking coverage, must be consistent with the flight safety limits of § 417.213 and the flight safety system time delay of § 417.221.
              (8) Any planned gap in tracking coverage must not occur at the same time as any planned switching of command transmitters.
              (c) Telemetry. (1) A flight safety system must include a telemetry system that provides the flight safety crew with accurate flight safety data during preflight operations and during flight until the planned safe flight state.

              (d) Communications network. A flight safety system must include a communications network that connects all flight safety functions with all launch control centers and any down-range tracking and command transmitter sites. The system must provide for recording all required data and all voice communications channels during launch countdown and flight.
              (e) Data processing, display, and recording. A flight safety system must include one or more subsystems that process, display, and record flight safety data to support the flight safety crew's monitoring of the launch, including the data that the crew uses to make a flight termination decision. The system must:
              (1) Satisfy § 417.123 for any computing system, software, or firmware that must operate properly to ensure the accuracy of the data;
              (2) Receive vehicle status data from tracking and telemetry, evaluate the data for validity, and provide valid data for display and recording;
              (3) Perform any reformatting of the data as appropriate and forward it to display and recording devices;
              (4) Display real-time data against background displays of the nominal trajectory and flight safety limits established in accordance with the flight safety analysis required by subpart C of this part;
              (5) Display and record raw input and processed data at a rate that maintains the validity of the data and at no less than 0.1-second intervals;
              (6) Record the timing of when flight safety system commands are input by the flight safety crew; and
              (7) Record all health and status parameters of the command control system, including the transmitter failover parameters, command outputs, check channel or pilot tone monitor, and status of communications.
              (f) Displays and controls. (1) A flight safety system must include the displays of real-time data and controls that the flight safety crew needs to perform all its functions, such as to monitor and evaluate launch vehicle performance, communicate with other flight safety and launch personnel, and initiate flight termination.

              (2) A flight safety system must present all data that the flight safety crew needs to ensure that all flight commit criteria are satisfied for each launch, such as hazard area surveillance, any aircraft and ship traffic information, meteorological conditions, and the flight termination system monitoring data of section D417.17.
              (3) The real-time displays must include all data that the flight safety crew needs to ensure the operational functionality of the flight safety system, including availability and quality, and that all flight termination rules are satisfied for each launch, such as:
              (i) Launch vehicle tracking data, such as instantaneous vacuum impact point, drag corrected debris footprint, or present launch vehicle position and velocities as a function of time;
              (ii) Vehicle status data from telemetry, including yaw, pitch, roll, and motor chamber pressure;
              (iii) The flight termination system monitoring data of section D417.17;

              (4) The controls must allow the flight safety crew to turn a command transmitter on and off, manually switch from primary to backup transmitter antenna, and switch between each transmitter site. These functions may be accomplished through controls available to command transmitter support personnel and communications between those personnel and the flight safety crew.
              (5) Each set of command transmitter system controls must include a means of identifying when it has primary control of the system.
              (6) The displays must include a means of immediately notifying the flight safety system crew of any automatic fail-over of the system transmitters.
              (7) All flight safety system controls must be dedicated to the flight safety system and must not rely on time or equipment shared with other systems.
              (8) All data transmission links between any control, transmitter, or antenna must consist of two or more complete and independent duplex circuits. The routing of these circuits must ensure that they are physically separated from each other to eliminate any potential single failure point in the command control system in accordance with § 417.303(d).
              (9) The system must include hardware or procedural security provisions for controlling access to all controls and other related hardware. These security provisions must ensure that only the flight safety crew can initiate a flight safety system transmission.
              (10) The system must include two independent means for the flight safety crew to initiate arm and destruct messages. The location and functioning of the controls must provide the crew easy access to the controls and prevent inadvertent activation.
              (11) The system must include a digital countdown for use in implementing the flight termination rules of § 417.113 that apply data loss flight times and the planned safe flight state. The system must also include a manual method of applying the data loss flight times in the event that the digital countdown malfunctions.

              (1) Have electrical and operational characteristics matching those of the actual destruct initiator;
              (2) Monitor the firing circuit output current, voltage, or energy, and indicate whether the firing output occurs. The indication that the output occurred must remain after the output is removed;

              (3) Have the ability to remain connected throughout ground processing until the electrical connection of the actual initiators is accomplished;
              (4) Include a capability that permits the issuance of destruct commands by test equipment only if the simulator is installed and connected to the firing lines; and
              (5) For any low voltage initiator, provide a stray current monitoring device in the firing line. The stray current monitoring device, such as a fuse or automatic recording system, must be capable of indicating a minimum of one-tenth of the maximum no-fire current.
              (i) Timing. A flight safety system must include a timing system that is synchronized to a universal time coordinate. The system must:
              (1) Initiate first motion signals;

              (6) Account for the interface between the launch vehicle systems and the flight termination system.
              (c) Single failure point. A command control system must undergo an analysis that demonstrates that the system satisfies the fault tolerance requirements of § 417.303(d). A flight termination system must undergo an analysis that demonstrates that the system satisfies the fault tolerance requirements of section D417.5(b). Each analysis must:

Each component of a flight termination system and command control system must undergo an analysis that demonstrates that any single short circuit occurring as a result of a bent electrical connection pin will not result in inadvertent system activation or inhibiting the proper operation of the system.
              (f) Radio frequency link. (1) The flight safety system must undergo a radio frequency link analysis to demonstrate that it satisfies the required 12-dB margin for nominal system performance and 6-dB margin for worst-case system performance.
              (2) When demonstrating the 12-dB margin, each link analysis must account for the following nominal system performance and attenuation factors:
              (i) Path losses due to plume or flame attenuation;
              (ii) Vehicle trajectory;
              (iii) Ground system and airborne system radio frequency characteristics; and
              (iv) The antenna gain value that ensures that the margin is satisfied over 95% of the antenna radiation sphere surrounding the launch vehicle.
              (3) When demonstrating the 6-dB margin, each link analysis must account for the following worst-case system performance and attenuation factors:
              (i) The system performance and attenuation factors of paragraph (f)(2) of this section;
              (ii) The command transmitter failover criteria of § 417.303(g) including the lowest output power provided by the transmitter system;
              (iii) Worst-case power loss due to antenna pointing inaccuracies; and
              (iv) Any other attenuation factors.
              (g) Sneak circuit. Each electronic component that contains an electronic inhibit that could inhibit the functioning, or cause inadvertent functioning of a flight termination system or command control system, must undergo a sneak circuit analysis. The analysis must demonstrate that there are no latent paths of an unwanted command that could, when all components otherwise function properly, cause the occurrence of an undesired, unplanned, or inhibited function that could cause a system anomaly. The analysis must determine the probability of an anomaly occurring for input to the system reliability analysis of paragraph (b) of this section.
              (h) Software and firmware. Any computing system, software, or firmware that performs a software safety critical function must undergo the analysis needed to ensure reliable operation and satisfy § 417.123.
              (i) Battery capacity. A flight termination system must undergo an analysis that demonstrates that each flight termination system battery has a total amp hour capacity of no less than 150% of the capacity needed during flight plus the capacity needed for load and activation checks, preflight and launch countdown checks, and any potential launch hold time. For a launch vehicle that uses any solid propellant, the analysis must demonstrate that the battery capacity allows for an additional 30-minute hang-fire hold time. The battery analysis must also demonstrate each flight termination system battery's ability to meet the charging temperature and current control requirements of appendix D of this part.
              (j) Survivability. A flight termination system must undergo an analysis that demonstrates that each subsystem and component, including their location on the launch vehicle, provides for the flight termination system to complete all its required functions when exposed to:
              (1) Breakup of the launch vehicle due to aerodynamic loading effects at high angle of attack trajectories during early stages of flight, including the effects of any automatic or inadvertent destruct system;
              (2) An engine hard-over nozzle induced tumble during each phase of flight for each stage; or
              (3) Launch vehicle staging, ignition, or any other normal or abnormal event that, when it occurs, could damage flight termination system hardware or inhibit the functionality of any subsystem or component, including any inadvertent separation destruct system.

              § 417.401
              Scope.
              This subpart contains public safety requirements that apply to launch processing and post-launch operations at a launch site in the United States. Ground safety requirements in this subpart apply to activities performed by, or on behalf of, a launch operator at a launch site in the United States. A licensed launch site operator must satisfy the requirements of part 420 of this chapter.
            
            
              § 417.402
              Compliance.
              (a) General. A launch operator's ground safety process must satisfy this subpart.
              (b) Ground safety analysis conducted for launch at a Federal launch range. This provision applies to all sections of this subpart. The FAA will accept a ground safety process conducted for a launch from a Federal launch range without need for further demonstration of compliance to the FAA if:
              (1) A launch operator has contracted with a Federal launch range for the provision of the ground safety process; and

              (2) The FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the Federal launch range's ground safety process satisfies the requirements of this subpart. In this case, the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's process as that of a launch operator.
              (c) Toxic release hazard analysis conducted for launch processing at a Federal launch range. The FAA will accept a toxic release hazard analysis conducted for launch processing from a Federal launch range provided the toxic release analysis satisfies the Federal launch range's requirements, and the FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the applicable Federal launch range safety-related launch services and property satisfy the requirements of this subpart.
              (d) Demonstration of compliance. For a licensed launch that does not satisfy paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a launch operator must demonstrate compliance to the FAA with the requirements of this subpart, and must include in its demonstration the analysis products required by subparts A and E of this part, and appendices I and J of this part.
              (e) Alternate methods. The FAA will approve an alternate hazard control method if a launch operator demonstrates, in accordance with § 406.3(b), that its proposed hazard control method provides an equivalent level of safety to that required by this subpart.
            
            
              § 417.403
              General.
              (a) Public safety. A launch operator must ensure that each hazard control is in place to protect the public from each potential hazard associated with launch processing and post-launch operations.
              (b) Ground safety analysis. A launch operator must perform and document a ground safety analysis that satisfies § 417.405 and appendix J of this part.
              (c) Local agreements. A launch operator must coordinate and perform launch processing and post-launch operations that satisfy local agreements to ensure the responsibilities and requirements in this part and § 420.57 of this chapter are met. A launch operator, when using a launch site of a licensed launch site operator, must coordinate the launch operator's operations with the launch site operator and with any agreements that the launch site operator has with local authorities that form a basis for the launch site operator's license.
              (d) Launch operator's exclusive use of a launch site. For a launch conducted from a launch site exclusive to its own use, a launch operator must satisfy the requirements of this subpart and of part 420 of this chapter, including subpart D of part 420.
            
            
              § 417.405
              Ground safety analysis.
              (a) A launch operator must perform a ground safety analysis for launch vehicle hardware, ground hardware including launch site and ground support equipment, launch processing, and post-launch operations at a launch site in the United States. The requirements of this section apply to the performance of the ground safety analysis and to the ground safety analysis products that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.402(d). This analysis must identify each potential hazard, each associated cause, and each hazard control that a launch operator must establish and maintain to keep each identified hazard from affecting the public. A launch operator must incorporate the launch site operator's systems and operations involved in ensuring public safety into the ground safety analysis.
              (b) Technical personnel who are knowledgeable of launch vehicle systems, launch processing, ground systems, operations, and their associated hazards must prepare the ground safety analysis. These individuals must be qualified to perform the ground safety analysis through training, education, and experience.
              (c) A launch operator must ensure personnel performing a ground safety analysis or preparing a ground safety analysis report will have the cooperation of the entire launch operator's organization. A launch operator must maintain supporting documentation and it must be available upon request.
              (d) A launch operator must:
              (1) Begin a ground safety analysis by identifying the systems and operations to be analyzed;

              (2) Define the extent of each system and operation being assessed to ensure there is no miscommunication as to what the hazards are, and who, in a launch operator's organization or other organization supporting the launch, controls those hazards; and
              (3) Ensure that the ground safety analysis accounts for each launch vehicle system and operation involved in launch processing and post-launch operations, even if only to show that no hazard exists.
              (e) A ground safety analysis need not account for potential hazards of a component if a launch operator demonstrates that no hazard to the public exists at the system level. A ground safety analysis need not account for an operation's individual task or subtask level if a launch operator demonstrates that no hazard to the public exists at the operation level. A launch operator must provide verifiable controls for hazards that are confined within the boundaries of a launch operator's facility to ensure the public will not have access to the associated hazard area while the hazard exists.
              (f) A launch operator must identify each potential hazard, including non-credible hazards. The probability of occurrence is not relevant with respect to identifying a hazard. Where an assertion is made that no hazard exists for a particular system or operation, the ground safety analysis must provide the rationale. A launch operator must identify the following hazards of each launch vehicle system, launch site and ground support equipment, launch processing, and post-launch operations:
              (1) System hazards, including explosives and other ordnance, solid and liquid propellants, toxic and radioactive materials, asphyxiants, cryogens, and high pressure. System hazards generally exist even when no operation is occurring; and
              (2) Operation hazards derived from an unsafe condition created by a system, operating environment, or an unsafe act.
              (g) A launch operator must categorize identified system and operation hazards as follows:
              (1) Public hazard. A hazard that extends beyond the launch location under the control of a launch operator. Public hazards include the following:
              (i) Blast overpressure and fragmentation resulting from an explosion;
              (ii) Fire and deflagration, including hazardous materials such as radioactive material, beryllium, carbon fibers, and propellants. A launch operator must assume that in the event of a fire, hazardous smoke from systems containing hazardous materials will reach the public;
              (iii) Sudden release of a hazardous material into the air, water, or ground; and
              (iv) Inadvertent ignition of a propulsive launch vehicle payload, stage, or motor.
              (2) Launch location hazard. A hazard that stays within the confines of the location under the control of a launch operator but extends beyond individuals doing the work. The confines may be bounded by a wall or a fence line of a facility or launch complex, or by a fenced or unfenced boundary of an entire industrial complex or multi-user launch site. A launch location hazard may affect the public depending on public access controls. Launch location hazards that may affect the public include the hazards listed in paragraphs (g)(1)(i)-(iv) of this section and additional hazards in potentially unsafe locations accessible to the public such as:
              (i) Unguarded electrical circuits or machinery;
              (ii) Oxygen deficient environments;
              (iii) Falling objects;
              (iv) Potential falls into unguarded pits or from unguarded elevated work platforms; and
              (v) Sources of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation such as x-rays, radio transmitters, and lasers.
              (3) Employee hazard. A hazard to individuals performing a launch operator's work, but not to other people in the area. A launch operator must comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local employee safety regulations. A launch operator's ground safety analysis must identify employee hazards and demonstrate that there are no associated public safety issues.
              (4) Non-credible hazard. A hazard for which possible adverse effects on people or property would be negligible and where the possibility of adverse effects on people or property is remote. A launch operator's ground safety analysis must identify non-credible hazards and demonstrate that the hazard is non-credible.
              (h) A ground safety analysis must identify each hazard cause for each public hazard and launch location hazard. The ground safety analysis must account for conditions, acts, or chain of events that can result in a hazard. The ground safety analysis must account for the possible failure of any control or monitoring circuitry within hardware systems that can cause a hazard.
              (i) A ground safety analysis must identify the hazard controls to be established by a launch operator for each hazard cause identified in paragraph (h) of this section. A launch operator's hazard controls include the use of engineering controls for the containment of hazards within defined areas and the control of public access to those areas.
              (j) A launch operator must verify all information in a ground safety analysis, including design margins, fault tolerance and successful completion of tests. A launch operator must:
              (1) Trace any identified hardware to an engineering drawing or other document that describes hardware configuration;
              (2) Trace any test or analysis used in developing the ground safety analysis to a report or memorandum that describes how the test or analysis was performed;
              (3) Ensure the accuracy of the test or analysis and the associated results;
              (4) Trace any procedural hazard control identified to a written procedure, and approved by the person designated under § 417.103(b)(2) or the person's designee, with the paragraph or step number of the procedure specified;
              (5) Identify a verifiable hazard control for each hazard; if a hazard control is not verifiable, a launch operator may include it as an informational note on the hazard analysis form;
              (6) For each hazard control, reference a released drawing, report, procedure or other document that verifies the existence of the hazard control; and
              (7) Maintain records, as required by § 417.15, of the documentation that verifies the information in the ground safety analysis.
              (k) A launch operator must ensure the continuing accuracy of its ground safety analysis. The analysis of systems and operations must not end upon submission of a ground safety analysis report to the FAA during the license application process. A launch operator must analyze each new or modified system or operation for potential hazards that can affect the public. A launch operator must ensure that each existing system and operation is subject to continual scrutiny and that the information in a ground safety analysis report is kept current.
            
            
              § 417.407
              Hazard control implementation.

              (4) Hazard controls after launch or an attempt to launch that satisfy § 417.415; and
              (5) Controls for propellant and explosive hazards that satisfy § 417.417.
              (b) Hazard control verification. A launch operator must establish a hazard tracking process to ensure that each identified hazard has a verifiable hazard control. Verification status must remain “open” for an individual hazard control until the hazard control is verified to exist in a released drawing, report, procedure, or similar document.
              (c) Hazard control configuration control. A launch operator must establish and maintain a configuration control process for safety critical hardware. Procedural steps to verify hazard controls, and their associated documentation, cannot be changed without coordination with the person designated in § 417.103(b)(2).
              (d) Inspections. When a potential hazard exists, a launch operator must conduct periodic inspections of related hardware, software, and facilities. A launch operator must ensure qualified and certified personnel, as required by § 417.105, conduct the inspection. A launch operator must demonstrate that the time interval between inspections is sufficient to ensure satisfaction of this subpart. A launch operator must ensure safety devices and other hazard controls must remain in place for that hazard, and that safety devices and other hazard controls must remain in working order so that no unsafe conditions exist.
              (e) Procedures. A launch operator must conduct each launch processing or post-launch operation involving a public hazard or a launch location hazard pursuant to written procedures that incorporate the hazard controls identified by a launch operator's ground safety analysis and as required by this subpart. The person designated in § 417.103(b)(2) must approve the procedures. A launch operator must maintain an “as-run” copy of each procedure. The “as-run” procedure copy must include changes, start and stop dates, and times that each procedure was performed and observations made during the operations.
              (f) Hazardous materials. A launch operator must establish procedures for the receipt, storage, handling, use, and disposal of hazardous materials, including toxic substances and sources of ionizing radiation. A launch operator must establish procedures for responding to hazardous material emergencies and protecting the public that complies with the accident investigation plan as defined in § 417.111(h)(2). These procedures must include:
              (1) Identification of each hazard and its effects;
              (2) Actions to be taken in response to release of a hazardous material;
              (3) Identification of protective gear and other safety equipment that must be available in order to respond to a release;
              (4) Evacuation and rescue procedures;
              (5) Chain of command; and
              (6) Communication both on-site and off-site to surrounding communities and local authorities.
              (g) Toxic release hazard notifications and evacuations. A launch operator must perform a toxic release hazard analysis for launch processing performed at the launch site that satisfies section I417.7 of this part. A launch operator must apply toxic plume modeling techniques that satisfy section I417.7 of this part and ensure that notifications and evacuations are accomplished to protect the public from potential toxic release.
            
            
              § 417.409
              System hazard controls.
              (a) General. A launch operator must establish and maintain hazard controls for each system that presents a public hazard as identified by the ground safety analysis and satisfy the requirements of this section. A launch operator must:
              (1) Ensure a system be at least single fault tolerant to creating a public hazard unless other hazard control criteria are specified for the system by the requirements of this part. A system capable of creating a catastrophic public hazard must be at least dual fault tolerant. Dual fault tolerant system hazard controls include: Switches, valves, or similar components that prevent an unwanted transfer or release of energy or hazardous materials;
              (2) Ensure each hazard control used to provide fault tolerance is independent from other hazard controls so that no single action or event can remove more than one inhibit. A launch operator must prevent inadvertent activation of hazard control devices such as switches and valves;
              (3) Provide at least two fully redundant safety devices if a safety device must function in order to control a public hazard. A single action or event must not be capable of disabling both safety devices; and
              (4) Ensure computing systems and software used to control a public hazard satisfy the requirements of § 417.123.
              (b) Structures and material handling equipment. A launch operator must ensure safety factors applied in the design of a structure or material handling equipment account for static and dynamic loads, environmental stresses, expected wear, and duty cycles. A launch operator must:

              (1) Inspect structures and material handling equipment to verify workmanship, proper operations, and maintenance;
              
              (2) Prepare plans to ensure proper operations and maintenance of structures and material handling equipment;
              (3) Assess structures and material handling equipment for potential single point failure;
              (4) Eliminate single point failures from structures and material handling equipment or subject the structures and material handling equipment to specific inspection and testing to ensure proper operation. Single point failure welds must undergo both surface and volumetric non-destructive inspection to verify that no rejectable discontinuities exist;
              (5) Establish other non-destructive inspection techniques if a volumetric inspection cannot be performed. A launch operator, in such a case, must demonstrate through the licensing process that the inspection processes used accurately verify the absence of rejectable discontinuities; and
              (6) Ensure qualified and certified personnel, as defined in § 417.105, conduct the inspections.
              (c) Pressure vessels and pressurized systems. A launch operator must apply the following hazard controls to a pressurized flight or ground pressure vessel, component, or systems:
              (1) Qualified and certified personnel, as defined in § 417.105, must test each pressure vessel, component, or system upon installation and before being placed into service, and periodically inspect to ensure that no rejectable discontinuities exists;
              (2) Safety factors applied in the design of a pressure vessel, component, or system must account for static and dynamic loads, environmental stresses, and expected wear;
              (3) Pressurized system flow-paths, except for pressure relief and emergency venting, must be single fault tolerant to causing pressure ruptures and material releases during launch processing; and
              (4) Provide pressure relief and emergency venting capability to protect against pressure ruptures. Pressure relief devices must provide the flow rate necessary to prevent a rupture in the event a pressure vessel is exposed to fire.
              (d) Electrical and mechanical systems. A launch operator must apply the following hazard controls to electrical or mechanical systems that can release electrical or mechanical energy during launch processing:
              (1) A launch operator must ensure electrical and mechanical systems, including systems that generate ionizing or non-ionizing radiation, are single fault tolerant to providing or releasing electrical or mechanical energy;
              (2) In areas where flammable material exists, a launch operator must ensure electrical systems and equipment are hermetically sealed, explosion proof, intrinsically safe, purged, or otherwise designed so as not to provide an ignition source. A launch operator must assess each electrical system as a possible source of thermal energy and ensure that the electrical system can not act as an ignition source; and
              (3) A launch operator must prevent unintentionally conducted or radiated energy due to possible bent pins in a connector, a mismated connector, shorted wires, or unshielded wires within electrical power and signal circuits that interface with hazardous subsystems.
              (e) Propulsion systems. A propulsion system must be dual fault tolerant to inadvertently becoming propulsive. Propulsion systems must be single fault tolerant to inadvertent mixing of fuel and oxidizer. Each material in a propulsion system must be compatible with other materials that may contact the propulsion system during launch processing including materials used to assemble and clean the system.

An electrically initiated ordnance system must include ordnance initiation devices and arming devices, also referred to as safe and arm devices, that provide a removable and replaceable mechanical barrier or other positive means of interrupting power to each ordnance firing circuit to prevent inadvertent initiation of ordnance. A mechanical safe and arm device must have a safing pin that locks the mechanical barrier in a safe position. A mechanical actuated ordnance device must also have a safing pin that prevents mechanical movement within the device. A launch operator must comply with section D417.13 of this part for specific safing and arming requirements for a flight termination system;
              (3) Protect ordnance systems from stray energy through grounding, bonding, and shielding; and
              (4) Current limit any monitoring or test circuitry that interfaces with an ordnance system to protect against inadvertent initiation of ordnance. Equipment used to measure bridgewire resistance on electro-explosive devices must be special purpose ordnance system instrumentation with features that limit current.
            
            
              § 417.411
              Safety clear zones for hazardous operations.
              (a) A launch operator must define a safety clear zone that confines the adverse effects of each operation involving a public hazard or launch location hazard. A launch operator's safety clear zones must satisfy the following:
              (1) A launch operator must establish a safety clear zone that accounts for the potential blast, fragment, fire or heat, toxic and other hazardous energy or material potential of the associated systems and operations. A launch operator must base a safety clear zone on the following criteria:
              (i) For a possible explosive event, base a safety clear zone on the worst case event, regardless of the fault tolerance of the system;
              (ii) For a possible toxic event, base a safety clear zone on the worst case event. A launch operator must have procedures in place to maintain public safety in the event toxic releases reach beyond the safety clear zone; and
              (iii) For a material handling operation, base a safety clear zone on a worst case event for that operation.
              (2) A launch operator must establish a safety clear zone when the launch vehicle is in a launch command configuration with the flight safety systems fully operational and on internal power.
              (b) A launch operator must establish restrictions that prohibit public access to a safety clear zone during a hazardous operation. A safety clear zone may extend to areas beyond the launch location boundaries if local agreements provide for restricting public access to such areas and a launch operator verifies that the safety clear zone is clear of the public during the hazardous operation.
              (c) A launch operator's procedures must verify that the public is outside of a safety clear zone prior to a launch operator beginning a hazardous operation.
              (d) A launch operator must control a safety clear zone to ensure no public access during the hazardous operation. Safety clear zone controls include:
              (1) Use of security guards and equipment;
              (2) Physical barriers; and
              (3) Warning signs, and other types of warning devices.
            
            
              § 417.413
              Hazard areas.
              (a) General. A launch operator must define a hazard area that confines the adverse effects of a hardware system should an event occur that presents a public hazard or launch location hazard. A launch operator must prohibit public access to the hazard area whenever a hazard is present unless the requirements for public access of paragraph (b) of this section are met.
              (b) Public access. A launch operator must establish a process for authorizing public access if visitors or members of the public must have access to a launch operator's facility or launch location. The process must ensure that each member of the public is briefed on the hazards within the facility and related safety warnings, procedures, and rules that provide protection, or a launch operator must ensure that each member of the public is accompanied by a knowledgeable escort.
              (c) Hazard controls during public access. A launch operator must establish procedural controls that prevent hazardous operations from taking place while members of the public have access to the launch location and must verify that system hazard controls are in place that prevent initiation of a hazardous event. Hazard controls and procedures that prevent initiation of a hazardous event include the following:
              (1) Use of lockout devices or other restraints on system actuation switches or other controls to eliminate the possibility of inadvertent actuation of a hazardous system.
              (2) Disconnect ordnance systems from power sources, incorporate the use of safing plugs, or have safety devices in place that prevent inadvertent initiation. Activity involving the control circuitry of electrically activated safety devices must not be ongoing while the public has access to the hazard area. Install safing pins on safe and arm devices and mechanically actuated devices. Disconnect explosive transfer lines, not protected by a safe and arm device or a mechanically actuated device or equivalent.
              (3) When systems or tanks are loaded with hypergols or other toxic materials, close the system or tank and verify it is leak-tight with two verifiable closures, such as a valve and a cap, to every external flow path or fitting. Such a system must also be in a steady-state condition.
              (4) Keep each pressurized system below its maximum allowable working pressure and do not allow it to be in a dynamic state. Activity involving the control circuitry of electrically activated pressure system valves must not be ongoing while the public has access to the associated hazard area. Launch vehicle systems must not be pressurized to more than 25% of the system's design burst pressure, when the public has access to the associated hazard area.
              (5) Do not allow sources of ionizing or non-ionizing radiation, such as, x-rays, nuclear power sources, high-energy radio transmitters, radar, and lasers to be present or verify they are to be inactive when the public has access to the associated hazard area.
              (6) Guard physical hazards to prevent potential physical injury to visiting members of the public. Physical hazards include the following:
              (i) Potential falling objects;
              (ii) Falls from an elevated height; and
              (iii) Protection from potentially hazardous vents, such as pressure relief discharge vents.
              (7) Maintain and verify that safety devices or safety critical systems are operating properly prior to permitting public access.
            
            
              § 417.415
              Post-launch and post-flight-attempt hazard controls.
              (a) A launch operator must establish, maintain and perform procedures for controlling hazards and returning the launch facility to a safe condition after a successful launch. Procedural hazard controls must include:
              (1) Provisions for extinguishing fires;
              (2) Re-establishing full operational capability of safety devices, barriers, and platforms; and
              (3) Access control.
              (b) A launch operator must establish procedures for controlling hazards associated with a failed flight attempt where a solid or liquid launch vehicle engine start command was sent, but the launch vehicle did not liftoff. These procedures must include the following:
              (1) Maintaining and verifying that each flight termination system remains operational until verification that the launch vehicle does not represent a risk of inadvertent liftoff. If an ignition signal has been sent to a solid rocket motor, the flight termination system must remain armed and active for a period of no less than 30 minutes. During this time, flight termination system batteries must maintain sufficient voltage and current capacity for flight termination system operation. The flight termination system receivers must remain captured by the command control system transmitter's carrier signal;

              (2) Assuring that the vehicle is in a safe configuration, including its propulsion and ordnance systems. The flight safety system crew must have access to the vehicle status. Re-establish safety devices and bring each pressurized system down to safe pressure levels; and
              (3) Prohibiting launch complex entry until the launch pad area safing procedures are complete.
              (c) A launch operator must establish procedural controls for hazards associated with an unsuccessful flight where the launch vehicle has a land or water impact. These procedures must include the following provisions:
              (1) Evacuation and rescue of members of the public, to include modeling the dispersion and movement of toxic plumes, identification of areas at risk, and communication with local government authorities;
              (2) Extinguishing fires;
              (3) Securing impact areas to ensure that personnel and the public are evacuated, and ensure that no unauthorized personnel or members of the public enter, and to preserve evidence; and
              (4) Ensuring public safety from hazardous debris, such as plans for recovery and salvage of launch vehicle debris and safe disposal of hazardous materials.
            
            
              § 417.417
              Propellants and explosives.
              (a) A launch operator must comply with the explosive safety criteria in part 420 of this chapter.
              (b) A launch operator must ensure that:
              (1) The explosive site plan satisfies part 420 of this chapter;
              (2) Only those explosive facilities and launch points addressed in the explosive site plan are used and only for their intended purpose; and
              (3) The total net explosive weight for each explosive hazard facility and launch point must not exceed the maximum net explosive weight limit indicated on the explosive site plan for each location.
              (c) A launch operator must establish, maintain, and perform procedures that ensure public safety for the receipt, storage, handling, inspection, test, and disposal of explosives.
              (d) A launch operator must establish and maintain each procedural system control to prevent inadvertent initiation of propellants and explosives. These controls must include the following:
              (1) Protect ordnance systems from stray energy through methods of bonding, grounding, and shielding, and controlling radio frequency radiation sources in a radio frequency radiation exclusion area. A launch operator must determine the vulnerability of its electro-explosive devices and systems to radio frequency radiation and establish radio frequency radiation power limits or radio frequency radiation exclusion areas as required by the launch site operator or to ensure safety.
              (2) Keep ordnance safety devices, as required by § 417.409, in place until the launch complex is cleared as part of the final launch countdown. No members of the public may re-enter the complex until each safety device is re-established.
              (3) Do not allow heat and spark or flame producing devices in an explosive or propellant facility without written approval and oversight from a launch operator's safety organization.
              (4) Do not allow static producing materials in close proximity to solid or liquid propellants, electro-explosive devices, or systems containing flammable liquids.
              (5) Use fire safety measures including:
              (i) Elimination or reduction of flammable and combustible materials;
              (ii) Elimination or reduction of ignition sources;
              (iii) Fire and smoke detection systems;
              (iv) Safe means of egress; and
              (v) Timely fire suppression response.
              (6) Include lightning protection on each facility used to store or process explosives to prevent inadvertent initiation of propellants and explosives due to lightning unless the facility complies with the lightning protection criteria of § 420.71 of this part.
              (e) A launch operator, in the event of an emergency, must perform the accident investigation plan as defined in § 417.111(h).
            
          
          
             
            
              
              Pt. 417, App. A
              Appendix A to Part 417—Flight Safety Analysis Methodologies and Products for a Launch Vehicle Flown With a Flight Safety System
              A417.1 Scope
              The requirements of this appendix apply to the methods for performing the flight safety analysis required by § 417.107(f) and subpart C of this part. The methodologies contained in this appendix provide an acceptable means of satisfying the requirements of subpart C and provide a standard and a measure of fidelity against which the FAA will measure any proposed alternative analysis approach. This appendix also identifies the analysis products that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e).
              A417.3 Applicability
              The requirements of this appendix apply to a launch operator and the launch operator's flight safety analysis unless the launch operator clearly and convincingly demonstrates that an alternative approach provides an equivalent level of safety. If a Federal launch range performs the launch operator's analysis, § 417.203(d) applies. Section A417.33 applies to the flight of any unguided suborbital launch vehicle that uses a wind-weighting safety system. All other sections of this appendix apply to the flight of any launch vehicle required to use a flight safety system as required by § 417.107(a). For any alternative flight safety system approved by the FAA as required by § 417.301(b), the FAA will determine the applicability of this appendix during the licensing process.
              A417.5 General
              A launch operator's flight safety analysis must satisfy the requirements for public risk management and the requirements for the compatibility of the input and output of dependent analyses of § 417.205.
              A417.7 Trajectory
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a trajectory analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.207. This section applies to the computation of each of the trajectories required by § 417.207 and to each trajectory analysis product that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e).
              (b) Wind standards. A trajectory analysis must incorporate wind data in accordance with the following:
              (1) For each launch, a trajectory analysis must produce ”with-wind” launch vehicle trajectories pursuant to paragraph (f)(6) of this section and do so using composite wind profiles for the month that the launch will take place or composite wind profiles that are as severe or more severe than the winds for the month that the launch will take place.
              (2) A composite wind profile used for the trajectory analysis must have a cumulative percentile frequency that represents wind conditions that are at least as severe as the worst wind conditions under which flight would be attempted for purposes of achieving the launch operator's mission. These worst wind conditions must account for the launch vehicle's ability to operate normally in the presence of wind and accommodate any flight safety limit constraints.
              (c) Nominal trajectory. A trajectory analysis must produce a nominal trajectory that describes a launch vehicle's flight path, position and velocity, where all vehicle aerodynamic parameters are as expected, all vehicle internal and external systems perform exactly as planned, and no external perturbing influences other than atmospheric drag and gravity affect the launch vehicle.
              (d) Dispersed trajectories. A trajectory analysis must produce the following dispersed trajectories and describe the distribution of a launch vehicle's position and velocity as a function of winds and performance error parameters in the uprange, downrange, left-crossrange and right-crossrange directions.
              (1) Three-sigma maximum and minimum performance trajectories. A trajectory analysis must produce a three-sigma maximum performance trajectory that provides the maximum downrange distance of the instantaneous impact point for any given time after lift-off. A trajectory analysis must produce a three-sigma minimum performance trajectory that provides the minimum downrange distance of the instantaneous impact point for any given time after lift-off. For any time after lift-off, the instantaneous impact point dispersion of a normally performing launch vehicle must lie between the extremes achieved at that time after lift-off by the three-sigma maximum and three-sigma minimum performance trajectories. The three-sigma maximum and minimum performance trajectories must account for wind and performance error parameter distributions as follows:
              (i) For each three-sigma maximum and minimum performance trajectory, the analysis must use composite head wind and composite tail wind profiles that represent the worst wind conditions under which a launch would be attempted as required by paragraph (b) of this section.
              (ii) Each three-sigma maximum and minimum performance trajectory must account for all launch vehicle performance error parameters identified as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section that have an effect upon instantaneous impact point range.
              (2) Three-sigma left and right lateral trajectories. A trajectory analysis must produce a three-sigma left lateral trajectory that provides the maximum left crossrange distance of the instantaneous impact point for any time after lift-off. A trajectory analysis must produce a three-sigma right lateral trajectory that provides the maximum right crossrange distance of the instantaneous impact point for any time after lift-off. For any time after lift-off, the instantaneous impact point dispersion of a normally performing launch vehicle must lie between the extremes achieved at that time after liftoff by the three-sigma left lateral and three-sigma right lateral performance trajectories. The three-sigma lateral performance trajectories must account for wind and performance error parameter distributions as follows:
              (i) In producing each left and right lateral trajectory, the analysis must use composite left and composite right lateral-wind profiles that represent the worst wind conditions under which a launch would be attempted as required by paragraph (b) of this section.
              (ii) The three-sigma left and right lateral trajectories must account for all launch vehicle performance error parameters identified as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section that have an effect on the lateral deviation of the instantaneous impact point.
              (3) Fuel-exhaustion trajectory. A trajectory analysis must produce a fuel-exhaustion trajectory for the launch of any launch vehicle with a final suborbital stage that will terminate thrust nominally without burning to fuel exhaustion. The analysis must produce the trajectory that would occur if the planned thrust termination of the final suborbital stage did not occur. The analysis must produce a fuel-exhaustion trajectory that extends either the nominal trajectory taken through fuel exhaustion of the last suborbital stage or the three-sigma maximum trajectory taken through fuel exhaustion of the last suborbital stage, whichever produces an instantaneous impact point with the greatest range for any time after liftoff.
              (e) Straight-up trajectory. A trajectory analysis must produce a straight-up trajectory that begins at the planned time of ignition, and that simulates a malfunction that causes the launch vehicle to fly in a vertical or near vertical direction above the launch point. A straight-up trajectory must last no less than the sum of the straight-up time determined as required by section A417.15 plus the duration of a potential malfunction turn determined as required by section A417.9(b)(2).
              (f) Analysis process and computations. A trajectory analysis must produce each three-sigma trajectory required by this appendix using a six-degree-of-freedom trajectory model and an analysis method, such as root sum-square or Monte Carlo, that accounts for all individual launch vehicle performance error parameters that contribute to the dispersion of the launch vehicle's instantaneous impact point.
              (1) A trajectory analysis must identify all launch vehicle performance error parameters and each parameter's distribution to account for all launch vehicle performance variations and any external forces that can cause offsets from the nominal trajectory during normal flight. A trajectory analysis must account for, but need not be limited to, the following performance error parameters:
              (i) Thrust;
              (ii) Thrust misalignment;
              (iii) Specific impulse;
              (iv) Weight;
              (v) Variation in firing times of the stages;
              (vi) Fuel flow rates;
              (vii) Contributions from the guidance, navigation, and control systems;
              (ix) Steering misalignment; and
              (x) Winds.
              (2) Each three-sigma trajectory must account for the effects of wind from liftoff through the point in flight where the launch vehicle attains an altitude where wind no longer affects the launch vehicle.
              (g) Trajectory analysis products. The products of a trajectory analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include the following:
              (1) Assumptions and procedures. A description of all assumptions, procedures and models, including the six-degrees-of-freedom model, used in deriving each trajectory.
              (2) Three-sigma launch vehicle performance error parameters. A description of each three-sigma performance error parameter accounted for by the trajectory analysis and a description of each parameter's distribution determined as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
              (3) Wind profile. A graph and tabular listing of each wind profile used in performing the trajectory analysis as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the worst case winds required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The graph and tabular wind data must provide wind magnitude and direction as a function of altitude for the air space regions from the Earth's surface to 100,000 feet in altitude for the area intersected by the launch vehicle trajectory. Altitude intervals must not exceed 5000 feet.
              (4) Launch azimuth. The azimuthal direction of the trajectory's ”X-axis” at liftoff measured clockwise in degrees from true north.
              (5) Launch point. Identification and location of the proposed launch point, including its name, geodetic latitude, geodetic longitude, and geodetic height.
              (6) Reference ellipsoid. The name of the reference ellipsoid used by the trajectory analysis to approximate the average curvature of the Earth and the following information about the model:
              (i) Length of semi-major axis;
              
              (ii) Length of semi-minor axis;
              (iii) Flattening parameter;
              (iv) Eccentricity;
              (v) Gravitational parameter;
              (vi) Angular velocity of the Earth at the equator; and
              (vii) If the reference ellipsoid is not a WGS-84 ellipsoidal Earth model, the equations that convert the filed ellipsoid information to the WGS-84 ellipsoid.
              (7) Temporal trajectory items. A launch operator must provide the following temporal trajectory data for time intervals not in excess of one second and for the discrete time points that correspond to each jettison, ignition, burnout, and thrust termination of each stage. If any stage burn time lasts less than four seconds, the time intervals must not exceed 0.2 seconds. The launch operator must provide the temporal trajectory data from launch up to a point in flight when effective thrust of the final stage terminates, or to thrust termination of the stage or burn that places the vehicle in orbit. For an unguided sub-orbital launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, the launch operator must provide these data for each nominal quadrant launcher elevation angle and payload weight. The launch operator must provide these data on paper in text format and electronically in ASCII text, space delimited format. The launch operator must provide an electronic “read-me” file that identifies the data and their units of measure in the individual disk files.
              (i) Trajectory time-after-liftoff. A launch operator must provide trajectory time-after liftoff measured from first motion of the first thrusting stage of the launch vehicle. The tabulated data must identify the first motion time as T-0 and as the “0.0” time point on the trajectory.
              (ii) Launch vehicle direction cosines. A launch operator must provide the direction cosines of the roll axis, pitch axis, and yaw axis of the launch vehicle. The roll axis is a line identical to the launch vehicle's longitudinal axis with its origin at the nominal center of gravity positive towards the vehicle nose. The roll plane is normal to the roll axis at the vehicle's nominal center of gravity. The yaw axis and the pitch axis are any two orthogonal axes lying in the roll plane. The launch operator must provide roll, pitch and yaw axes of right-handed systems so that, when looking along the roll axis toward the nose, a clockwise rotation around the roll axis will send the pitch axis toward the yaw axis. The right-handed system must be oriented so that the yaw axis is positive in the downrange direction while in the vertical position (roll axis upward from surface) or positive at an angle of 180 degrees to the downrange direction. The axis may be related to the vehicle's normal orientation with respect to the vehicle's trajectory but, once defined, remain fixed with respect to the vehicle's body. The launch operator must indicate the positive direction of the yaw axis chosen. The analysis products must present the direction cosines using the EFG reference system described in paragraph (g)(7)(iv) of this section.
              (iii) X, Y, Z, XD, YD, ZD trajectory coordinates. A launch operator must provide the launch vehicle position coordinates (X, Y, Z) and velocity magnitudes (XD, YD, ZD) referenced to an orthogonal, Earth-fixed, right-handed coordinate system. The XY plane must be tangent to the ellipsoidal Earth at the origin, which must coincide with the launch point. The positive X-axis must coincide with the launch azimuth. The positive Z-axis must be directed away from the ellipsoidal Earth. The Y-axis must be positive to the left looking downrange.
              (iv) E, F, G, ED, FD, GD trajectory coordinates. A launch operator must provide the launch vehicle position coordinates (E, F, G) and velocity magnitudes (ED, FD, GD) referenced to an orthogonal, Earth fixed, Earth centered, right-handed coordinate system. The origin of the EFG system must be at the center of the reference ellipsoid. The E and F axes must lie in the plane of the equator and the G-axis coincides with the rotational axis of the Earth. The E-axis must be positive through 0° East longitude (Greenwich Meridian), the F-axis positive through 90' East longitude, and the G-axis positive through the North Pole. This system must be non-inertial and rotate with the Earth.
              (v) Resultant Earth-fixed velocity. A launch operator must provide the square root of the sum of the squares of the XD, YD, and ZD components of the trajectory state vector.
              (vi) Path angle of velocity vector. A launch operator must provide the angle between the local horizontal plane and the velocity vector measured positive upward from the local horizontal. The local horizontal must be a plane tangent to the ellipsoidal Earth at the sub-vehicle point.
              (vii) Sub-vehicle point. A launch operator must provide sub-vehicle point coordinates that include present position geodetic latitude and present position longitude. These coordinates must be at each trajectory time on the surface of the ellipsoidal Earth model and located at the intersection of the line normal to the ellipsoid and passing through the launch vehicle center of gravity.
              (viii) Altitude. A launch operator must provide the distance from the sub-vehicle point to the launch vehicle's center of gravity.
              (ix) Present position arc-range. A launch operator must provide the distance measured along the surface of the reference ellipsoid, from the launch point to the sub-vehicle point.
              (x) Total weight. A launch operator must provide the sum of the inert and propellant weights for each time point on the trajectory.
              
              (xi) Total vacuum thrust. A launch operator must provide the total vacuum thrust for each time point on the trajectory.
              (xii) Instantaneous impact point data. A launch operator must provide instantaneous impact point geodetic latitude, instantaneous impact point longitude, instantaneous impact point arc-range, and time to instantaneous impact. The instantaneous impact point arc-range must consist of the distance, measured along the surface of the reference ellipsoid, from the launch point to the instantaneous impact point. For each point on the trajectory, the time to instantaneous impact must consist of the vacuum flight time remaining until impact if all thrust were terminated at the time point on the trajectory.
              (xiii) Normal trajectory distribution. A launch operator must provide a description of the distribution of the dispersed trajectories required under paragraph (d) of this section, such as the elements of covariance matrices for the launch vehicle position coordinates and velocity component magnitudes.
              A417.9 Malfunction turn
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a malfunction turn analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.209. This section applies to the computation of the malfunction turns and the production of turn data required by § 417.209 and to the malfunction turn analysis products that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e).
              (b) Malfunction turn analysis constraints. The following constraints apply to a malfunction turn analysis:
              (1) The analysis must produce malfunction turns that start at a given malfunction start time. The turn must last no less than 12 seconds. These duration limits apply regardless of whether or not the vehicle would breakup or tumble before the prescribed duration of the turn.
              (2) A malfunction turn analysis must account for the thrusting periods of flight along a nominal trajectory beginning at first motion until thrust termination of the final thrusting stage or until the launch vehicle achieves orbit, whichever occurs first.
              (3) A malfunction turn must consist of a 90-degree turn or a turn in both the pitch and yaw planes that would produce the largest deviation from the nominal instantaneous impact point of which the launch vehicle is capable at any time during the malfunction turn as required by paragraph (d) of this section.
              (4) The first malfunction turn must start at liftoff. The analysis must account for subsequent malfunction turns initiated at regular nominal trajectory time intervals not to exceed four seconds.
              (5) A malfunction turn analysis must produce malfunction turn data for time intervals of no less than one second over the duration of each malfunction turn.
              (6) The analysis must assume that the launch vehicle performance is nominal up to the point of the malfunction that produces the turn.
              (7) A malfunction turn analysis must not account for the effects of gravity.
              (8) A malfunction turn analysis must ensure the tumble turn envelope curve maintains a positive slope throughout the malfunction turn duration as illustrated in figure A417.9-1. When calculating a tumble turn for an aerodynamically unstable launch vehicle, in the high aerodynamic region it often turns out that no matter how small the initial deflection of the rocket engine, the airframe tumbles through 180 degrees, or one-half cycle, in less time than the required turn duration period. In such a case, the analysis must use a 90-degree turn as the malfunction turn.
              (c) Failure modes. A malfunction turn analysis must account for the significant failure modes that result in a thrust vector offset from the nominal state. If a malfunction turn at a malfunction start time can occur as a function of more than one failure mode, the analysis must account for the failure mode that causes the most rapid and largest launch vehicle instantaneous impact point deviation.
              (d) Type of malfunction turn. A malfunction turn analysis must establish the maximum turning capability of a launch vehicle's velocity vector during each malfunction turn by accounting for a 90-degree turn to estimate the vehicle's turning capability or by accounting for trim turns and tumble turns in both the pitch and yaw planes to establish the vehicle's turning capability. When establishing the turning capability of a launch vehicle's velocity vector, the analysis must account for each turn as follows:
              (1) 90-degree turn. A 90-degree turn must constitute a turn produced at the malfunction start time by instantaneously re-directing and maintaining the vehicle's thrust at 90 degrees to the velocity vector, without regard for how this situation can be brought about.
              (2) Pitch turn. A pitch turn must constitute the angle turned by the launch vehicle's total velocity vector in the pitch-plane. The velocity vector's pitch-plane must be the two dimensional surface that includes the launch vehicle's yaw-axis and the launch vehicle's roll-axis.
              (3) Yaw turn. A yaw turn must constitute the angle turned by the launch vehicle's total velocity vector in the lateral plane. The velocity vector's lateral plane must be the two dimensional surface that includes the launch vehicle's pitch axis and the launch vehicle's total velocity.
              
              (4) Trim turn. A trim turn must constitute a turn where a launch vehicle's thrust moment balances the aerodynamic moment while a constant rotation rate is imparted to the launch vehicle's longitudinal axis. The analysis must account for a maximum-rate trim turn made at or near the greatest angle of attack that can be maintained while the aerodynamic moment is balanced by the thrust moment, whether the vehicle is stable or unstable.
              (5) Tumble turn. A tumble turn must constitute a turn that results if the launch vehicle's airframe rotates in an uncontrolled fashion, at an angular rate that is brought about by a thrust vector offset angle, and if the offset angle is held constant throughout the turn. The analysis must account for a series of tumble turns, each turn with a different thrust vector offset angle, that are plotted on the same graph for each malfunction start time.
              (6) Turn envelope. A turn envelope must constitute a curve on a tumble turn graph that has tangent points to each individual tumble turn curve computed for each malfunction start time. The curve must envelope the actual tumble turn curves to predict tumble turn angles for each area between the calculated turn curves. Figure A417.9-1 depicts a series of tumble turn curves and the tumble turn envelope curve.
              (7) Malfunction turn capabilities. When not using a 90-degree turn, a malfunction turn analysis must establish the launch vehicle maximum turning capability as required by the following malfunction turn constraints:
              (i) Launch vehicle stable at all angles of attack. If a launch vehicle is so stable that the maximum thrust moment that the vehicle could experience cannot produce tumbling, but produces a maximum-rate trim turn at some angle of attack less than 90 degrees, the analysis must produce a series of trim turns, including the maximum-rate trim turn, by varying the initial thrust vector offset at the beginning of the turn. If the maximum thrust moment results in a maximum-rate trim turn at some angle of attack greater than 90 degrees, the analysis must produce a series of trim turns for angles of attack up to and including 90 degrees.
              (ii) Launch vehicle aerodynamically unstable at all angles of attack. If flying a trim turn is not possible even for a period of only a few seconds, the malfunction turn analysis need only establish tumble turns. Otherwise, the malfunction turn analysis must establish a series of trim turns, including the maximum-rate trim turn, and the family of tumble turns.
              (iii) Launch vehicle unstable at low angles of attack but stable at some higher angles of attack. If large engine deflections result in tumbling, and small engine deflections do not, the analysis must produce a series of trim and tumble turns as required by paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section for launch vehicles aerodynamically unstable at all angles of attack. If both large and small constant engine deflections result in tumbling, regardless of how small the deflection might be, the analysis must account for the malfunction turn capabilities achieved at the stability angle of attack, assuming no upsetting thrust moment, and must account for the turns achieved by a tumbling vehicle.
              (e) Malfunction turn analysis products. The products of a malfunction turn analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include:
              (1) A description of the assumptions, techniques, and equations used in deriving the malfunction turns.
              (2) A set of sample calculations for at least one flight hazard area malfunction start time and one downrange malfunction start time. The sample computation for the downrange malfunction must start at a time at least 50 seconds after the flight hazard area malfunction start time or at the time of nominal thrust termination of the final stage minus the malfunction turn duration.
              (3) A launch operator must file malfunction turn data in electronic tabular and graphic formats. The graphs must use scale factors such that the plotting and reading accuracy do not degrade the accuracy of the data. For each malfunction turn start time, a graph must use the same time scales for the malfunction velocity vector turn angle and malfunction velocity magnitude plot pairs. A launch operator must provide tabular listings of the data used to generate the graphs in digital ASCII file format. A launch operator must file the data items required in this paragraph for each malfunction start time and for time intervals that do not exceed one second for the duration of each malfunction turn.
              (i) Velocity turn angle graphs. A launch operator must file a velocity turn angle graph for each malfunction start time. For each velocity turn angle graph, the ordinate axis must represent the total angle turned by the velocity vector, and the abscissa axis must represent the time duration of the turn and must show increments not to exceed one second. The series of tumble turns must include the envelope of all tumble turn curves. The tumble turn envelope must represent the tumble turn capability for all possible constant thrust vector offset angles. Each tumble turn curve selected to define the envelope must appear on the same graph as the envelope. A launch operator must file a series of trim turn curves for representative values of thrust vector offset. The series of trim turn curves must include the maximum rate trim turn. Figure A417.9-1 depicts an example family of tumble turn curves and the tumble turn velocity vector envelope.
              
                
                ER25AU06.005
              
              (ii) Velocity magnitude graphs. A launch operator must file a velocity magnitude graph for each malfunction start time. For each malfunction velocity magnitude graph, the ordinate axis must represent the magnitude of the velocity vector and the abscissa axis must represent the time duration of the turn. Each graph must show the abscissa divided into increments not to exceed one second. Each graph must show the total velocity magnitude plotted as a function of time starting with the malfunction start time for each thrust vector offset used to define the corresponding velocity turn-angle curve. A launch operator must provide a corresponding velocity magnitude curve for each velocity tumble turn angle curve and each velocity trim-turn angle curve. For each individual tumble turn curve selected to define the tumble turn envelope, the corresponding velocity magnitude graph must show the individual tumble turn curve's point of tangency to the envelope. The point of tangency must consist of the point where the tumble turn envelope is tangent to an individual tumble turn curve produced with a discrete thrust vector offset angle. A launch operator must transpose the points of tangency to the velocity magnitude curves by plotting a point on the velocity magnitude curve at the same time point where tangency occurs on the corresponding velocity tumble-turn angle curve. Figure A417.9-2 depicts an example tumble turn velocity magnitude curve.
              
                
                ER25AU06.006
              
              (iii) Vehicle orientation. The launch operator must file tabular or graphical data for the vehicle orientation in the form of roll, pitch, and yaw angular orientation of the vehicle longitudinal axis as a function of time into the turn for each turn initiation time. Angular orientation of a launch vehicle's longitudinal axis is illustrated in figures A417.9-3 and A417.9-4.

                ER25AU06.008
              
              (iv) Onset conditions. A launch operator must provide launch vehicle state information for each malfunction start time. This state data must include the launch vehicle thrust, weight, velocity magnitude and pad-centered topocentric X, Y, Z, XD, YD, ZD state vector.
              (v) Breakup information. A launch operator must specify whether its launch vehicle will remain intact throughout each malfunction turn. If the launch vehicle will break up during a turn, the launch operator must identify the time for launch vehicle breakup on each velocity magnitude graph. The launch operator must show the time into the turn at which vehicle breakup would occur as either a specific value or a probability distribution for time until breakup.
              (vi) Inflection point. A launch operator must identify the inflection point on each tumble turn envelope curve and maximum rate trim turn curve for each malfunction start time as illustrated in figure A417.9-1. The inflection point marks the point in time during the turn where the slope of the curve stops increasing and begins to decrease or, in other words, the point were the concavity of the curve changes from concave up to concave down. The inflection point on a malfunction turn curve must identify the time in the malfunction turn that the launch vehicle body achieves a 90-degree rotation from the nominal position. On a tumble turn curve the inflection point must represent the start of the launch vehicle tumble.
              A417.11 Debris
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a debris analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.211. This section applies to the debris data required by § 417.211 and the debris analysis products that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e).
              (b) Debris analysis constraints. A debris analysis must produce the debris model described in paragraph (c) of this section. The analysis must account for all launch vehicle debris fragments, individually or in groupings of fragments called classes. The characteristics of each debris fragment represented by a class must be similar enough to the characteristics of all the other debris fragments represented by that class that all the debris fragments of the class can be described by a single set of characteristics. Paragraph (c)(10) of this section applies when establishing a debris class. A debris model must describe the physical, aerodynamic, and harmful characteristics of each debris fragment either individually or as a member of a class. A debris model must consist of lists of individual debris or debris classes for each cause of breakup and any planned jettison of debris, launch vehicle components, or payload. A debris analysis must account for:
              (1) Launch vehicle breakup caused by the activation of any flight termination system. The analysis must account for:
              (i) The effects of debris produced when flight termination system activation destroys an intact malfunctioning vehicle.
              (ii) Spontaneous breakup of the launch vehicle, if the breakup is assisted by the action of any inadvertent separation destruct system.
              (iii) The effects of debris produced by the activation of any flight termination system after inadvertent breakup of the launch vehicle.
              (2) Debris due to any malfunction where forces on the launch vehicle may exceed the launch vehicle's structural integrity limits.
              (3) The immediate post-breakup or jettison environment of the launch vehicle debris, and any change in debris characteristics over time from launch vehicle breakup or jettison until debris impact.
              (4) The impact overpressure, fragmentation, and secondary debris effects of any confined or unconfined solid propellant chunks and fueled components containing either liquid or solid propellants that could survive to impact, as a function of vehicle malfunction time.
              (5) The effects of impact of the intact vehicle as a function of failure time. The intact impact debris analysis must identify the trinitrotoluene (TNT) yield of impact explosions, and the numbers of fragments projected from all such explosions, including non-launch vehicle ejecta and the blast overpressure radius. The analysis must use a model for TNT yield of impact explosion that accounts for the propellant weight at impact, the impact speed, the orientation of the propellant, and the impacted surface material.
              (c) Debris model. A debris analysis must produce a model of the debris resulting from planned jettison and from unplanned breakup of a launch vehicle for use as input to other analyses, such as establishing flight safety limits and hazard areas and performing debris risk, toxic, and blast analyses. A launch operator's debris model must satisfy the following:
              (1) Debris fragments. A debris model must provide the debris fragment data required by this section for the launch vehicle flight from the planned ignition time until the launch vehicle achieves orbital velocity for an orbital launch. For a sub-orbital launch, the debris model must provide the debris fragment data required by this section for the launch vehicle flight from the planned ignition time until impact of the last thrusting stage. A debris model must provide debris fragment data for the number of time periods sufficient to meet the requirements for smooth and continuous contours used to define hazard areas as required by section A417.23.
              (2) Inert fragments. A debris model must identify all inert fragments that are not volatile and that do not burn or explode under normal and malfunction conditions. A debris model must identify all inert fragments for each breakup time during flight corresponding to a critical event when the fragment catalog is significantly changed by the event. Critical events include staging, payload fairing jettison, and other normal hardware jettison activities.
              (3) Explosive and non-explosive propellant fragments. A debris model must identify all propellant fragments that are explosive or non-explosive upon impact. The debris model must describe each propellant fragment as a function of time, from the time of breakup through ballistic free-fall to impact. The debris model must describe the characteristics of each fragment, including its origin on the launch vehicle, representative dimensions and weight at the time of breakup and at the time of impact. For any fragment identified as an un-contained or contained propellant fragment, whether explosive or non-explosive, the debris model must identify whether or not it burns during free fall, and provide the consumption rate during free fall. The debris model must identify:
              (i) Solid propellant that is exposed directly to the atmosphere and that burns but does not explode upon impact as “un-contained non-explosive solid propellant.”
              (ii) Solid or liquid propellant that is enclosed in a container, such as a motor case or pressure vessel, and that burns but does not explode upon impact as “contained non-explosive propellant.”
              (iii) Solid or liquid propellant that is enclosed in a container, such as a motor case or pressure vessel, and that explodes upon impact as “contained explosive propellant fragment.”
              (iv) Solid propellant that is exposed directly to the atmosphere and that explodes upon impact as “un-contained explosive solid propellant fragment.”
              (4) Other non-inert debris fragments. In addition to the explosive and flammable fragments required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a debris model must identify any other non-inert debris fragments, such as toxic or radioactive fragments, that present any other hazards to the public.
              (5) Fragment weight. At each modeled breakup time, the individual fragment weights must approximately add up to the sum total weight of inert material in the vehicle and the weight of contained liquid propellants and solid propellants that are not consumed in the initial breakup or conflagration.
              (6) Fragment imparted velocity. A debris model must identify the maximum velocity imparted to each fragment due to potential explosion or pressure rupture. When accounting for imparted velocity, a debris model must:
              (i) Use a Maxwellian distribution with the specified maximum value equal to the 97th percentile; or
              (ii) Identify the distribution, and must state whether or not the specified maximum value is a fixed value with no uncertainty.
              (7) Fragment projected area. A debris model must include each of the axial, transverse, and mean tumbling areas of each fragment. If the fragment may stabilize under normal or malfunction conditions, the debris model must also provide the projected area normal to the drag force.
              (8) Fragment ballistic coefficient. A debris model must include the axial, transverse, and tumble orientation ballistic coefficient for each fragment's projected area as required by paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
              (9) Debris fragment count. A debris model must include the total number of each type of fragment required by paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section and created by a malfunction.
              (10) Fragment classes. A debris model must categorize each malfunction debris fragment into classes where the characteristics of the mean fragment in each class conservatively represent every fragment in the class. The model must define fragment classes for fragments whose characteristics are similar enough to be described and treated by a single average set of characteristics. A debris class must categorize debris by each of the following characteristics, and may include any other useful characteristics:
              (i) The type of fragment, defined by paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section. All fragments within a class must be the same type, such as inert or explosive.
              (ii) Debris subsonic ballistic coefficient (βsub). The difference between the smallest log10(βsub) value and the largest log10(βsub) value in a class must not exceed 0.5, except for fragments with βsub less than or equal to three. Fragments with βsub less than or equal to three may be grouped within a class.

              (iii) Breakup-imparted velocity (ΔV). A debris model must categorize fragments as a function of the range of ΔV for the fragments within a class and the class's median subsonic ballistic coefficient. For each class, the debris model must keep the ratio of the maximum breakup-imparted velocity (ΔVmax) to minimum breakup-imparted velocity (ΔVmin) within the following bound:
              
                ER25AU06.106
              
              Where: β′sub is the median subsonic ballistic coefficient for the fragments in a class.
              
              (d) Debris analysis products. The products of a debris analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include:
              (1) Debris model. The launch operator's debris model that satisfies the requirements of this section.
              (2) Fragment description. A description of the fragments contained in the launch operator's debris model. The description must identify the fragment as a launch vehicle part or component, describe its shape, representative dimensions, and may include drawings of the fragment.
              (3) Intact impact TNT yield. For an intact impact of a launch vehicle, for each failure time, a launch operator must identify the TNT yield of each impact explosion and blast overpressure hazard radius.
              (4) Fragment class data. The class name, the range of values for each parameter used to categorize fragments within a fragment class, and the number of fragments in any fragment class established as required by paragraph (c)(10) of this section.
              (5) Ballistic coefficient. The mean ballistic coefficient (β) and plus and minus three-sigma values of the β for each fragment class. A launch operator must provide graphs of the coefficient of drag (Cd) as a function of Mach number for the nominal and three-sigma β variations for each fragment shape. The launch operator must label each graph with the shape represented by the curve and reference area used to develop the curve. A launch operator must provide a Cd vs. Mach curve for any axial, transverse, and tumble orientations for any fragment that will not stabilize during free-fall conditions. For any fragment that may stabilize during free-fall, a launch operator must provide Cd vs. Mach curves for the stability angle of attack. If the angle of attack where the fragment stabilizes is other than zero degrees, a launch operator must provide both the coefficient of lift (CL) vs. Mach number and the Cd vs. Mach number curves. The launch operator must provide the equations for each Cd vs. Mach curve.
              (6) Pre-flight propellant weight. The initial preflight weight of solid and liquid propellant for each launch vehicle component that contains solid or liquid propellant.
              (7) Normal propellant consumption. The nominal and plus and minus three-sigma solid and liquid propellant consumption rate, and pre-malfunction consumption rate for each component that contains solid or liquid propellant.
              
              (8) Fragment weight. The mean and plus and minus three-sigma weight of each fragment or fragment class.
              (9) Projected area. The mean and plus and minus three-sigma axial, transverse, and tumbling areas for each fragment or fragment class. This information is not required for those fragment classes classified as burning propellant classes under section A417.25(b)(8).
              (10) Imparted velocities. The maximum incremental velocity imparted to each fragment class created by flight termination system activation, or explosive or overpressure loads at breakup. The launch operator must identify the velocity distribution as Maxwellian or must define the distribution, including whether or not the specified maximum value is a fixed value with no uncertainty.
              (11) Fragment type. The fragment type for each fragment established as required by paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section.
              (12) Origin. The part of the launch vehicle from which each fragment originated.
              (13) Burning propellant classes. The propellant consumption rate for those fragments that burn during free-fall.
              (14) Contained propellant fragments, explosive or non-explosive. For contained propellant fragments, whether explosive or non-explosive, a launch operator must provide the initial weight of contained propellant and the consumption rate during free-fall. The initial weight of the propellant in a contained propellant fragment is the weight of the propellant before any of the propellant is consumed by normal vehicle operation or failure of the launch vehicle.
              (15) Solid propellant fragment snuff-out pressure. The ambient pressure and the pressure at the surface of a solid propellant fragment, in pounds per square inch, required to sustain a solid propellant fragment's combustion during free-fall.
              (16) Other non-inert debris fragments. For each non-inert debris fragment identified as required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a launch operator must describe the diffusion, dispersion, deposition, radiation, and other hazard exposure characteristics used to determine the effective casualty area required by paragraph (d)(13) of this section.
              (17) Residual thrust dispersion. For each thrusting or non-thrusting stage having residual thrust capability following a launch vehicle malfunction, a launch operator must provide either the total residual impulse imparted or the full-residual thrust as a function of breakup time. For any stage not capable of thrust after a launch vehicle malfunction, a launch operator must provide the conditions under which the stage is no longer capable of thrust. For each stage that can be ignited as a result of a launch vehicle malfunction on a lower stage, a launch operator must identify the effects and duration of the potential thrust, and the maximum deviation of the instantaneous impact point, which can be brought about by the thrust. A launch operator must provide the explosion effects of all remaining fuels, pressurized tanks, and remaining stages, particularly with respect to ignition or detonation of upper stages if the flight termination system is activated during the burning period of a lower stage.
              A417.13 Flight safety limits.
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a flight safety limits analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.213. This section applies to the computation of the flight safety limits and identifying the location of populated or other protected areas as required by § 417.213 and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e).
              (b) Flight safety limits constraints. The analysis must establish flight safety limits as follows:
              (1) Flight safety limits must account for potential malfunction of a launch vehicle during the time from launch vehicle first motion through flight until the planned safe flight state determined as required by section A417.19.
              (2) For a flight termination at any time during launch vehicle flight, the impact limit lines must:
              (i) Represent no less than the extent of the debris impact dispersion for all debris fragments with a ballistic coefficient greater than or equal to three; and
              (ii) Ensure that the debris impact area on the Earth's surface that is bounded by the debris impact dispersion in the uprange, downrange and crossrange directions does not extend to any populated or other protected area.
              (3) Each debris impact area determined by a flight safety limits analysis must be offset in a direction away from populated or other protected areas. The size of the offset must account for all parameters that may contribute to the impact dispersion. The parameters must include:
              (i) Launch vehicle malfunction turn capabilities.
              (ii) Effective casualty area produced as required by section A417.25(b)(8).
              (iii) All delays in the identification of a launch vehicle malfunction.
              (iv) Malfunction imparted velocities, including any velocity imparted to vehicle fragments by breakup.
              (v) Wind effects on the malfunctioning vehicle and falling debris.
              (vi) Residual thrust remaining after flight termination.

              (vii) Launch vehicle guidance and performance errors.
              
              (viii) Lift and drag forces on the malfunctioning vehicle and falling debris including variations in drag predictions of fragments and debris.
              (ix) All hardware and software delays during implementation of flight termination.
              (x) All debris impact location uncertainties caused by conditions prior to, and after, activation of the flight termination system.
              (xi) Any other impact dispersion parameters peculiar to the launch vehicle.
              (xii) All uncertainty due to map error and launch vehicle tracking error.
              (c) Risk management. The requirements for public risk management of § 417.205(a) apply to a flight safety limits analysis. When employing risk assessment, the analysis must establish flight safety limits that satisfy paragraph (b) of this section, account for the products of the debris risk analysis performed as required by section A417.25, and ensure that any risk to the public satisfies the public risk criteria of § 417.107(b). When employing hazard isolation, the analysis must establish flight safety limits in accordance with the following:
              (1) The flight safety limits must account for the maximum deviation impact locations for the most wind sensitive debris fragment with a minimum of 11 ft-lbs of kinetic energy at impact.
              (2) The maximum deviation impact location of the debris identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for each trajectory time must account for the three-sigma impact location for the maximum deviation flight, and the launch day wind conditions that produce the maximum ballistic wind for that debris.
              (3) The maximum deviation flight must account for the instantaneous impact point, of the debris identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section at breakup, that is closest to a protected area and the maximum ballistic wind directed from the breakup point toward that protected area.
              (d) Flight safety limits analysis products. The products of a flight safety limits analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include:
              (1) A description of each method used to develop and implement the flight safety limits. The description must include equations and example computations used in the flight safety limits analysis.

The table must contain quantitative values that define flight safety limits. Each quantitative value must be rounded to the number of significant digits that can be determined from the uncertainty of the measurement device used to determine the flight safety limits and must be limited to a maximum of six decimal places.

A launch operator must provide a table of tracking error as a function of downrange distance from the launch point for each tracking station used to make flight safety control decisions. A launch operator must file a description of the method, showing equations and sample calculations, used to determine the tracking error. The table must contain the map and tracking error data points within 100 nautical miles of the reference point at an interval of one data point every 10 nautical miles, including the reference point. The table must contain map and tracking error data points beyond 100 nautical miles from the reference point at an interval of one data point every 100 nautical miles out to a distance that includes all populated or other areas protected by the flight safety limits.

              A417.15 Straight-up time
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a straight-up time analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.215. This section applies to the computation of straight-up time as required by § 417.215 and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e). The analysis must establish a straight-up time as the latest time-after-liftoff, assuming a launch vehicle malfunctioned and flew in a vertical or near vertical direction above the launch point, at which activation of the launch vehicle's flight termination system or breakup of the launch vehicle would not cause hazardous debris or critical overpressure to affect any populated or other protected area.
              (b) Straight-up time constraints. A straight-up time analysis must account for the following:
              (1) Launch vehicle trajectory. The analysis must use the straight-up trajectory determined as required by section A417.7(e).
              (2) Sources of debris impact dispersion. The analysis must use the sources described in section A417.13(b)(3)(iii) through (xii).
              (c) Straight-up time analysis products. The products of a straight-up-time analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include:

              (a) General. The flight safety analysis for a launch that involves flight over a populated or other protected area must include an overflight gate analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.217. This section applies to determining a gate as required by § 417.217 and the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e). The analysis must determine the portion, referred to as a gate, of a flight safety limit, through which a launch vehicle's tracking representation will be allowed to proceed without flight termination.
              (b) Overflight gate analysis constraints. The following analysis constraints apply to a gate analysis.
              (1) For each gate in a flight safety limit, all the criteria used for determining whether to allow passage through the gate or to terminate flight at the gate must use all the same launch vehicle flight status parameters as the criteria used for determining whether to terminate flight at a flight safety limit. For example, if the flight safety limits are a function of instantaneous impact point location, the criteria for determining whether to allow passage through a gate in the flight safety limit must also be a function of instantaneous impact point location. Likewise, if the flight safety limits are a function of drag impact point, the gate criteria must also be a function of drag impact point.
              (2) When establishing a gate in a flight safety limit, the analysis must ensure that the launch vehicle flight satisfies the flight safety requirements of § 417.107.
              (3) For each established gate, the analysis must account for:
              (i) All launch vehicle tracking and map errors.
              (ii) All launch vehicle plus and minus three-sigma trajectory limits.
              (iii) All debris impact dispersions.
              (4) The width of a gate must restrict a launch vehicle's normal trajectory ground trace.
              (c) Overflight gate analysis products. The products of a gate analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include:
              (1) A description of the methodology used to establish each gate.
              (2) A description of the tracking representation.
              (3) A tabular description of the input data.
              (4) Example analysis computations performed to determine a gate. If a launch involves more than one gate and the same methodology is used to determine each gate, the launch operator need only file the computations for one of the gates.
              (5) A graphic depiction of each gate. A launch operator must provide a depiction or depictions showing flight safety limits, protected area outlines, nominal and 3-sigma left and right trajectory ground traces, protected area overflight regions, and predicted impact dispersion about the three-sigma trajectories within the gate. Each depiction must show latitude and longitude grid lines, gate latitude and longitude labels, and the map scale.
              A417.19 Data loss flight time and planned safe flight state
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a data loss flight time analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.219. This section applies to the computation of data loss flight times and the planned safe flight state required by § 417.219, and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e).
              (b) Planned safe flight state. The analysis must establish a planned safe flight state for a launch as follows:
              (1) For a suborbital launch, the analysis must determine a planned safe flight state as the nominal state vector after liftoff that a launch vehicle's hazardous debris impact dispersion can no longer reach any protected area.
              (2) For an orbital launch where the launch vehicle's instantaneous impact point does not traverse a protected area prior to reaching orbit, the analysis must establish the planned safe flight state as the time after liftoff that the launch vehicle's hazardous debris impact dispersion can no longer reach any protected area or orbital insertion, whichever occurs first.

              (3) For an orbital launch where a gate permits overflight of a protected area and where orbital insertion occurs after reaching the gate, the analysis must determine the planned safe flight state as the time after liftoff when the time for the launch vehicle's instantaneous impact point to reach the gate is less than the time for the instantaneous impact point to reach any flight safety limit.
              (4) The analysis must account for a malfunction that causes the launch vehicle to proceed from its position at the trajectory time being evaluated toward the closest flight safety limit and protected area.
              (5) The analysis must account for the launch vehicle thrust vector that produces the highest instantaneous impact point range rate that the vehicle is capable of producing at the trajectory time being evaluated.
              (c) Data loss flight times. For each launch vehicle trajectory time, from the predicted earliest launch vehicle tracking acquisition time until the planned safe flight state, the analysis must determine the data loss flight time as follows:
              (1) The analysis must determine each data loss flight time as the minimum thrusting time for a launch vehicle to move from a normal trajectory position to a position where a flight termination would cause the malfunction debris impact dispersion to reach any protected area.
              (2) A data loss flight time analysis must account for a malfunction that causes the launch vehicle to proceed from its position at the trajectory time being evaluated toward the closest flight safety limit and protected area.
              (3) The analysis must account for the launch vehicle thrust vector that produces the highest instantaneous impact point range rate that the vehicle is capable of producing at the trajectory time being evaluated.
              (4) Each data loss flight time must account for the system delays at the time of flight.
              (5) The analysis must determine a data loss flight time for time increments that do not exceed one second along the launch vehicle nominal trajectory.
              (d) Products. The products of a data loss flight time and planned safe flight state analysis that a launch operator must file include:
              (1) A launch operator must describe the methodology used in its analysis, and identify all assumptions, techniques, input data, and equations used. A launch operator must file calculations performed for one data loss flight time in the vicinity of the launch site and one data loss flight time that is no less than 50 seconds later in the downrange area.
              (2) A launch operator must file a graphical description or depictions of the flight safety limits, the launch point, the launch site boundaries, the surrounding geographic area, any protected areas, the planned safe flight state within any applicable scale requirements, latitude and longitude grid lines, and launch vehicle nominal and three-sigma instantaneous impact point ground traces from liftoff through orbital insertion for an orbital launch, and through final impact for a suborbital launch. Each graph must show any launch vehicle trajectory instantaneous impact points plotted with sufficient frequency to provide a conformal estimate of the launch vehicle's instantaneous impact point ground trace curvature. A launch operator must provide labeled latitude and longitude lines and the map scale on the depiction.
              (3) A launch operator must provide a tabular description of each data loss flight time. The tabular description must include the malfunction start time and the geodetic latitude (positive north of the equator) and longitude (positive east of the Greenwich Meridian) coordinates of the intersection of the launch vehicle instantaneous impact point trajectory with the flight safety limit. The table must identify the first data lost flight time and planned safe flight state. The tabular description must include data loss flight times for trajectory time increments not to exceed one second.
              A417.21 Time delay
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a time delay analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.221. This section applies to the computation of time delays associated with a flight safety system and other launch vehicle systems and operations as required by § 417.221 and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e).
              (b) Time delay analysis constraints. The analysis must account for all significant causes of time delay between the violation of a flight termination rule and the time when a flight safety system is capable of terminating flight as follows:
              (1) The analysis must account for decision and reaction times, including variation in human response time, for flight safety official and other personnel that are part of a launch operator's flight safety system as defined by subpart D of this part.
              (2) The analyses must determine the time delay inherent in any data, from any source, used by a flight safety official for making flight termination decisions.
              (3) A time delay analysis must account for all significant causes of time delay, including data flow rates and reaction times, for hardware and software, including, but not limited to the following:
              (i) Tracking system. A time delay analysis must account for time delays between the launch vehicle's current location and last known location and that are associated with the hardware and software that make up the launch vehicle tracking system, whether or not it is located on the launch vehicle, such as transmitters, receivers, decoders, encoders, modulators, circuitry and any encryption and decryption of data.
              
              (ii) Display systems. A time delay analysis must account for delays associated with hardware and software that make up any display system used by a flight safety official to aid in making flight control decisions.

              (iii) Flight termination system and command control system. A time delay analysis must account for delays and response times associated with flight termination system and command control system hardware and software, such as transmitters, decoders, encoders, modulators, relays and shutdown, arming and destruct devices, circuitry and any encryption and decryption of data.
              (iv) Software specific time delays. A delay analysis must account for delays associated with any correlation of data performed by software, such as timing and sequencing; data filtering delays such as error correction, smoothing, editing, or tracking source selection; data transformation delays; and computation cycle time.
              (4) A time delay analysis must determine the time delay plus and minus three-sigma values relative to the mean time delay.
              (5) For use in any risk analysis, a time delay analysis must determine time delay distributions that account for the variance of time delays for potential launch vehicle failure, including but not limited to, the range of malfunction turn characteristics and the time of flight when the malfunction occurs.

              A417.23 Flight hazard areas
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a flight hazard area analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.223. This section applies to the determination of flight hazard areas for orbital and suborbital launch vehicles that use a flight termination system to protect the public as required by § 417.223 and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e). Requirements that apply to determining flight hazard areas for an unguided suborbital rocket that uses a wind-weighting safety system are contained in appendix C of this part.
              (b) Launch site flight hazard area. A flight hazard area analysis must establish a launch site flight hazard area that encompasses the launch point and:
              (1) If the flight safety analysis employs hazard isolation to establish flight safety limits as required by section A417.13(c), the launch site flight hazard area must encompass the flight safety limits.
              (2) If the flight safety analysis does not employ hazard isolation to establish the flight safety limits, the launch site flight hazard area must encompass all hazard areas established as required by paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.
              (c) Debris impact hazard area. The analysis must establish a debris impact hazard area that accounts for the effects of impacting debris resulting from normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight, except for toxic effects, and accounts for potential impact locations of all debris fragments. The analysis must establish a debris hazard area as follows:
              (1) An individual casualty contour that defines where the risk to an individual would exceed an expected casualty (Ec) criteria of 1 × 10 −6 if one person were assumed to be in the open and inside the contour during launch vehicle flight must bound a debris hazard area. The analysis must produce an individual casualty contour as follows:
              (i) The analysis must account for the location of a hypothetical person, and must vary the location of the person to determine when the risk would exceed the Ec criteria of 1 × 10 −6. The analysis must count a person as a casualty when the person's location is subjected to any inert debris impact with a mean expected kinetic energy greater than or equal to 11 ft-lbs or a peak incident overpressure equal to or greater than 1.0 psi due to explosive debris impact. The analysis must determine the peak incident overpressure using the Kingery-Bulmash relationship, without regard to sheltering, reflections, or atmospheric effects.

              (ii) The analysis must account for person locations that are no more than 1000 feet apart in the downrange direction and no more than 1000 feet apart in the crossrange direction to produce an individual casualty contour. For each person location, the analysis must sum the probabilities of casualty over all flight times for all debris groups.
              (iii) An individual casualty contour must consist of curves that are smooth and continuous. To accomplish this, the analysis must vary the time interval between the trajectory times assessed so that each location of a debris impact point is less than one-half sigma of the downrange dispersion distance.
              (2) The input for determining a debris impact hazard area must account for the results of the trajectory analysis required by section A417.7, the malfunction turn analysis required by section A417.9, and the debris analysis required by section A417.11 to define the impact locations of each class of debris established by the debris analysis, and the time delay analysis required by section A417.21.
              (3) The analysis must account for the extent of the impact debris dispersions for each debris class produced by normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight at each trajectory time. The analysis must also account for how the vehicle breaks up, either by the flight termination system or by aerodynamic forces, if the different breakup may result in a different probability of existence for each debris class. A debris impact hazard area must account for each impacting debris fragment classified as required by section A417.11(c).
              (4) The analysis must account for launch vehicle flight that exceeds a flight safety limit. The analysis must also account for trajectory conditions that maximize the mean debris impact distance during the flight safety system delay time determined as required by section A417.21 and account for a debris model that is representative of a flight termination or aerodynamic breakup. For each launch vehicle breakup event, the analysis must account for trajectory and breakup dispersions, variations in debris class characteristics, and debris dispersion due to any wind condition under which a launch would be attempted.
              (5) The analysis must account for the probability of failure of each launch vehicle stage and the probability of existence of each debris class. The analysis must account for the probability of occurrence of each type of launch vehicle failure. The analysis must account for vehicle failure probabilities that vary depending on the time of flight.
              (6) In addition to failure debris, the analysis must account for nominal jettisoned body debris impacts and the corresponding debris impact dispersions. The analysis must use a probability of occurrence of 1.0 for the planned debris fragments produced by normal separation events during flight.
              (d) Near-launch-point blast hazard area. A flight hazard area analysis must define a blast overpressure hazard area as a circle extending from the launch point with a radius equal to the 1.0 psi overpressure distance produced by the equivalent TNT weight of the explosive capability of the vehicle. In addition, the analysis must establish a minimum near-pad blast hazard area to provide protection from hazardous fragments potentially propelled by an explosion. The analysis must account for the maximum possible total solid and liquid propellant explosive potential of the launch vehicle and any payload. The analysis must define a blast overpressure hazard area using the following equations:
              
              Rop = 45 · (NEW)1/3
              
              
              Where:
              
              Rop is the over pressure distance in feet.
              NEW = WE · C (pounds).
              WE is the weight of the explosive in pounds.
              C is the TNT equivalency coefficient of the propellant being evaluated. A launch operator must identify the TNT equivalency of each propellant on its launch vehicle including any payload. TNT equivalency data for common liquid propellants is provided in tables A417-1. Table A417-2 provides factors for converting gallons of specified liquid propellants to pounds.
              
              (e) Other hazards. A flight hazard area analysis must identify any additional hazards, such as radioactive material, that may exist on the launch vehicle or payload. For each such hazard, the analysis must determine a hazard area that encompasses any debris impact point and its dispersion and includes an additional hazard radius that accounts for potential casualty due to the additional hazard. Analysis requirements for toxic release and far field blast overpressure are provided in § 417.27 and section A417.29, respectively.
              (1) Aircraft hazard areas. The analysis must establish an aircraft hazard area for each planned debris impact for the issuance of notices to airmen as required by § 417.121(e). Each aircraft hazard area must encompass an air space region, from an altitude of 60,000 feet to impact on the Earth's surface, that contains the three-sigma drag impact dispersion.
              (2) Ship hazard areas. The analysis must establish a ship hazard area for each planned debris impact for the issuance of notices to mariners as required by § 417.121(e). Each ship hazard area must encompass a surface region that contains the three-sigma drag impact dispersion.

              A417.25 Debris risk
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a debris risk analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.225. This section applies to the computation of the average number of casualties (Ec) to the collective members of debris hazards from the proposed flight of a launch vehicle as required by § 417.225 and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e).
              (b) Debris risk analysis constraints. The following constraints apply to a debris risk:

              (1) A debris risk analysis must use valid risk analysis models that compute Ec as the summation over all trajectory time intervals from lift-off through orbital insertion of the products of the probability of each possible event and the casualty consequences due to debris impacts for each possible event.

              (2) A debris risk analysis must account for the following populations:
              
              (i) The overflight of populations located inside any flight safety limits.
              (ii) All populations located within five-sigma left and right crossrange of a nominal trajectory instantaneous impact point ground trace and within five-sigma of each planned nominal debris impact.
              (iii) Any planned overflight of the public within any gate overflight areas.
              (iv) Any populations outside the flight safety limits identified as required by paragraph (b)(10) of this section.
              (3) A debris risk analysis must account for both inert and explosive debris hazards produced from any impacting debris caused by normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight. The analysis must account for the debris classes determined by the debris analysis required by section A417.11. A debris risk analysis must account for any inert debris impact with mean expected kinetic energy at impact greater than or equal to 11 ft-lbs and peak incident overpressure of greater than or equal to 1.0 psi due to any explosive debris impact. The analysis must account for all debris hazards as a function of flight time.
              (4) A debris risk analysis must account for debris impact points and dispersion for each class of debris as follows:
              (i) A debris risk analysis must account for drag corrected impact points and dispersions for each class of impacting debris resulting from normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight as a function of trajectory time from lift-off through orbital insertion, including each planned impact, for an orbital launch, and through final impact for a suborbital launch.
              (ii) The dispersion for each debris class must account for the position and velocity state vector dispersions at breakup, the variance produced by breakup imparted velocities, the effect of winds on both the ascent trajectory state vector at breakup and the descending debris piece impact location the variance produced by aerodynamic properties for each debris class, and any other dispersion variances.
              (iii) A debris risk analysis must account for the survivability of debris fragments that are subject to reentry aerodynamic forces or heating. A debris class may be eliminated from the debris risk analysis if the launch operator demonstrates that the debris will not survive to impact.
              (5) A debris risk analysis must account for launch vehicle failure probability. The following constraints apply:
              (i) For flight safety analysis purposes, a failure occurs when a vehicle does not complete any phase of normal flight or exhibits the potential for the stage or its debris to impact the Earth or reenter the atmosphere during the mission or any future mission of similar vehicle capability. Also, either a launch incident or launch accident constitutes a failure.
              (ii) For a launch vehicle with fewer than 2 flights completed, the analysis must use a reference value for the launch vehicle failure probability estimate equal to the upper limit of the 60% two-sided confidence limits of the binomial distribution for outcomes of all previous launches of vehicles developed and launched in similar circumstances. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for the level of experience demonstrated by the launch operator and other factors that affects the probability of failure. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate for the second launch based on evidence obtained from the first flight of the vehicle.
              (iii) For a launch vehicle with at least 2 flights completed, the analysis must use the reference value for the launch vehicle failure probability of Table A417-3 based on the outcomes of all previous launches of the vehicle. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for evidence obtained from the flight history of the vehicle. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for the nature of launch outcomes in the flight history of the vehicle, corrective actions taken in response to a failure of the vehicle, or other vehicle modifications that may affect reliability. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for the demonstrated quality of the engineering approach to launch vehicle processing, meeting safety requirements in this part, and associated hazard mitigation. The analysis must use a final failure estimate within the confidence limits of Table A417-3.
              (A) Values listed on the far left of Table A417-3 apply when no launch failures are experienced. Values on the far right apply when only launch failures are experienced. Values in between apply for flight histories that include both failures and successes.
              (B) Reference values in Table A417-3 are shown in bold. The reference values are the median values between 60% two-sided confidence limits of the binomial distribution. For the special cases of zero or N failures in N launch attempts, the reference values may also be recognized as the median value between the 80% one-sided confidence limit of the binomial distribution and zero or one, respectively.
              (C) Upper and lower confidence bounds in Table A417-3 are shown directly above and below each reference value. These confidence bounds are based on 60% two-sided confidence limits of the binomial distribution. For the special cases of zero or N failures in N launch attempts, the upper and lower confidence bounds are based on the 80% one-sided confidence limit, respectively.

              (6) A debris risk analysis must account for the dwell time of the instantaneous impact point ground trace over each populated or protected area being evaluated.

              (7) A debris risk analysis must account for the three-sigma instantaneous impact point trajectory variations in left-crossrange, right-crossrange, uprange, and downrange as a function of trajectory time, due to launch vehicle performance variations as determined by the trajectory analysis performed as required by section A417.7.
              (8) A debris risk analysis must account for the effective casualty area as a function of launch vehicle flight time for all impacting debris generated from a catastrophic launch vehicle malfunction event or a planned impact event. The effective casualty area must account for both payload and vehicle systems and subsystems debris. The effective casualty area must account for all debris fragments determined as part of a launch operator's debris analysis as required by section A417.11. The effective casualty area for each explosive debris fragment must account for a 1.0 psi blast overpressure radius and the projected debris effects for all potentially explosive debris. The effective casualty area for each inert debris fragment must:
              (i) Account for bounce, skip, slide, and splatter effects; or
              (ii) Equal seven times the maximum projected area of the fragment.
              (9) A debris risk analysis must account for current population density data obtained from a current population database for the region being evaluated or by estimating the current population using exponential population growth rate equations applied to the most current historical data available. The population model must define population centers that are similar enough to be described and treated as a single average set of characteristics without degrading the accuracy of the debris risk estimate.
              (10) For a launch vehicle that uses a flight safety system, a debris risk analysis must account for the collective risk to any populations outside the flight safety limits during flight, including people who will be at any public launch viewing area during flight. For such populations, in addition to the constraints of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(9) of this section, a launch operator's debris risk analysis must account for the following:
              (i) The probability of a launch vehicle failure that would result in debris impact in protected areas outside the flight safety limits.
              (ii) The failure probability of the launch operator's flight safety system. A flight safety system failure rate of 0.002 may be used if the flight safety system complies with the flight safety system requirements of subpart D of this part. For an alternate flight safety system approved as required by § 417.107(a)(3), the launch operator must demonstrate the validity of the probability of failure through the licensing process.
              (iii) Current population density data and population projections for the day and time of flight for the areas outside the flight safety limits.
              (c) Debris risk analysis products. The products of a debris risk analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include:
              (1) A debris risk analysis report that provides the analysis input data, probabilistic risk determination methods, sample computations, and text or graphical charts that characterize the public risk to geographical areas for each launch.
              (2) Geographic data showing:
              (i) The launch vehicle nominal, five-sigma left-crossrange and five-sigma right-crossrange instantaneous impact point ground traces;
              (ii) All exclusion zones relative to the instantaneous impact point ground traces; and
              (iii) All populated areas included in the debris risk analysis.
              (3) A discussion of each launch vehicle failure scenario accounted for in the analysis and the probability of occurrence, which may vary with flight time, for each failure scenario. This information must include failure scenarios where a launch vehicle:
              (i) Flies within normal limits until some malfunction causes spontaneous breakup or results in a commanded flight termination;
              (ii) Experiences malfunction turns; and
              (iii) Flight safety system fails to function.
              (4) A population model applicable to the launch overflight regions that contains the following: region identification, location of the center of each population center by geodetic latitude and longitude, total area, number of persons in each population center, and a description of the shelter characteristics within the population center.
              (5) A description of the launch vehicle, including general information concerning the nature and purpose of the launch and an overview of the launch vehicle, including a scaled diagram of the general arrangement and dimensions of the vehicle. A launch operator's debris risk analysis products may reference other documentation filed with the FAA containing this information. The description must include:
              (i) Weights and dimensions of each stage.
              (ii) Weights and dimensions of any booster motors attached.
              (iii) The types of fuel used in each stage and booster.
              (iv) Weights and dimensions of all interstage adapters and skirts.
              (v) Payload dimensions, materials, construction, and any payload fuel; payload fairing construction, materials, and dimensions; and any non-inert components or materials that add to the effective casualty area of the debris, such as radioactive or toxic materials or high-pressure vessels.

              (6) A typical sequence of events showing times of ignition, cutoff, burnout, and jettison of each stage, firing of any ullage rockets, and starting and ending times of coast periods and control modes.
              
              (7) The following information for each launch vehicle motor:
              (i) Propellant type and composition;
              (ii) Thrust profile;
              (iii) Propellant weight and total motor weight as a function of time;
              (iv) A description of each nozzle and steering mechanism;
              (v) For solid rocket motors, internal pressure and average propellant thickness, or borehole radius, as a function of time;
              (vi) Maximum impact point deviations as a function of failure time during destruct system delays. Burn rate as a function of ambient pressure;

              (8) The launch vehicle's launch and failure history, including a summary of past vehicle performance. For a new vehicle with little or no flight history, a launch operator must provide all known data on similar vehicles that include:
              (i) Identification of the launches that have occurred;
              (ii) Launch date, location, and direction of each launch;
              (iii) The number of launches that performed normally;
              (iv) Behavior and impact location of each abnormal experience;

              (9) The values of probability of impact (PI) and expected casualty (Ec) for each populated area.
              A417.27 Toxic release hazard analysis
              A flight safety analysis must include a toxic release hazard analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.227. A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must satisfy the methodology requirements of appendix I of this part. A launch operator must file the analysis products identified in appendix I of this part as required by § 417.203(e).
              A417.29 Far field blast overpressure effects analysis
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a far field blast overpressure effects hazard analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.229. This section applies to the computation of far field blast overpressure effects from the proposed flight of a launch vehicle as required by § 417.229 and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e). The analysis must account for distant focus overpressure and any overpressure enhancement to establish the potential for broken windows due to peak incident overpressures below 1.0 psi and related casualties due to falling or projected glass shards. The analysis must employ either paragraph (b) of this section or the risk analysis of paragraph (c) of this section.
              (b) Far field blast overpressure hazard analysis. Unless an analysis satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section a far field blast overpressure hazard analysis must satisfy the following:
              (1) Explosive yield factors. The analysis must use explosive yield factor curves for each type or class of solid or liquid propellant used by the launch vehicle. Each explosive yield factor curve must be based on the most accurate explosive yield data for the corresponding type or class of solid or liquid propellant based on empirical data or computational modeling.
              (2) Establish the maximum credible explosive yield. The analysis must establish the maximum credible explosive yield resulting from normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight. The explosive yield must account for impact mass and velocity of impact on the Earth's surface. The analysis must account for explosive yield expressed as a TNT equivalent for peak overpressure.
              (3) Characterize the population exposed to the hazard. The analysis must demonstrate whether any population centers are vulnerable to a distant focus overpressure hazard using the methodology provided by section 6.3.2.4 of the American National Standard Institute's ANSI S2.20-1983, “Estimating Air Blast Characteristics for Single Point Explosions in Air with a Guide to Evaluation of Atmospheric Propagation and Effects” and as follows:
              (i) For the purposes of this analysis, a population center must include any area outside the launch site and not under the launch operator's control that contains an exposed site. An exposed site includes any structure that may be occupied by human beings, and that has at least one window, but does not include automobiles, airplanes, and waterborne vessels. The analysis must account for the most recent census information on each population center. The analysis must treat any exposed site for which no census information is available, or the census information indicates a population equal to or less than four persons, as a ‘single residence.’

              (ii) The analysis must identify the distance between the location of the maximum credible impact explosion and the location of each population center potentially exposed. Unless the location of the potential explosion site is limited to a defined region, the analysis must account for the distance between the potential explosion site and a population center as the minimum distance between any point within the region contained by the flight safety limits and the nearest exposed site within the population center.
              (iii) The analysis must account for all weather conditions optimized for a distant focus overpressure hazard by applying an atmospheric blast “focus factor” (F) of 5.
              (iv) The analysis must determine, using the methodology of section 6.3.2.4 of ANSI S2.20-1983, for each a population center, whether the maximum credible explosive yield of a launch meets, exceeds or is less than the “no damage yield limit,” of the population center. If the maximum credible explosive yield is less than the “no damage yield limit” for all exposed sites, the remaining requirements of this section do not apply. If the maximum credible explosive yield meets or exceeds the “no damage yield limit” for a population center then that population center is vulnerable to far field blast overpressure from the launch and the requirements of paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this section apply.
              (4) Estimate the quantity of broken windows. The analysis must use a focus factor of 5 and the methods provided by ANSI S2.20-1983 to estimate the number of potential broken windows within each population center determined to be vulnerable to the distant focus overpressure hazard as required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
              (5) Determine and implement measures necessary to prevent distant focus overpressure from breaking windows. For each population center that is vulnerable to far field blast overpressure from a launch, the analysis must identify mitigation measures to protect the public from serious injury from broken windows and the flight commit criteria of § 417.113(c) needed to enforce the mitigation measures. A launch operator's mitigation measures must include one or more of the following:
              (i) Apply a minimum 4-millimeter thick anti-shatter film to all exposed sites where the maximum credible yield exceeds the “no damage yield limit.”
              (ii) Evacuate the exposed public to a location that is not vulnerable to the distant focus overpressure hazard at least two hours prior to the planned flight time.
              (iii) If, as required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the analysis predicts that less than 20 windows will break, advise the public of the potential for glass breakage.
              (c) Far field blast overpressure risk analysis. If a launch operator does not employ paragraph (b) of this section to perform a far field overpressure hazard analysis, the launch operator must conduct a risk analysis that demonstrates that the launch will be conducted in accordance with the public risk criteria of § 417.107(b).
              (d) Far field blast overpressure effect products. The products of a far field blast overpressure analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include:
              (1) A description of the methodology used to produce the far field blast overpressure analysis results, a tabular description of the analysis input data, and a description of any far field blast overpressure mitigation measures implemented.
              (2) For any far field blast overpressure risk analysis, an example set of the analysis computations.
              (3) The values for the maximum credible explosive yield as a function of time of flight.
              (4) The distance between the potential explosion location and any population center vulnerable to the far field blast overpressure hazard. For each population center, the launch operator must identify the exposed populations by location and number of people.
              (5) Any mitigation measures established to protect the public from far field blast overpressure hazards and any flight commit criteria established to ensure the mitigation measures are enforced.
              A417.31 Collision avoidance
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a collision avoidance analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.231. This section applies to a launch operator obtaining a collision avoidance assessment from United States Strategic Command as required by § 417.231 and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e). United States Strategic Command refers to a collision avoidance analysis for a space launch as a conjunction on launch assessment.
              (b) Analysis constraints. A launch operator must satisfy the following when obtaining and implementing the results of a collision avoidance analysis:
              (1) A launch operator must provide United States Strategic Command with the launch window and trajectory data needed to perform a collision avoidance analysis for a launch as required by paragraph (c) of this section, at least 15 days before the first attempt at flight. The FAA will identify a launch operator to United States Strategic Command as part of issuing a license and provide a launch operator with current United States Strategic Command contact information.
              (2) A launch operator must obtain a collision avoidance analysis performed by United States Strategic Command 6 hours before the beginning of a launch window.

              (3) A launch operator may use a collision avoidance analysis for 12 hours from the time that United States Strategic Command determines the state vectors of the manned or mannable orbiting objects. If a launch operator needs an updated collision avoidance analysis due to a launch delay, the launch operator must file the request with United States Strategic Command at least 12 hours prior to the beginning of the new launch window.
              (4) For every 90 minutes, or portion of 90 minutes, that pass between the time United States Strategic Command last determined the state vectors of the orbiting objects, a launch operator must expand each wait in a launch window by subtracting 15 seconds from the start of the wait in the launch window and adding 15 seconds to the end of the wait in the launch window. A launch operator must incorporate all the resulting waits in the launch window into its flight commit criteria established as required by § 417.113.
              (c) Information required. A launch operator must prepare a collision avoidance analysis worksheet for each launch using a standardized format that contains the input data required by this paragraph. A launch operator must file the input data with United States Strategic Command for the purposes of completing a collision avoidance analysis. A launch operator must file the input data with the FAA as part of the license application process as required by § 415.115 of this chapter.
              (1) Launch information. A launch operator must file the following launch information:
              (i) Mission name. A mnemonic given to the launch vehicle/payload combination identifying the launch mission from all others.
              (ii) Segment number. A segment is defined as a launch vehicle stage or payload after the thrusting portion of its flight has ended. This includes the jettison or deployment of any stage or payload. A launch operator must provide a separate worksheet for each segment. For each segment, a launch operator must determine the “vector at injection” as defined by paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The data must present each segment number as a sequence number relative to the total number of segments for a launch, such as “1 of 5.”
              (iii) Launch window. The launch window opening and closing times in Greenwich Mean Time (referred to as ZULU time) and the Julian dates for each scheduled launch attempt.
              (2) Point of contact. The person or office within a launch operator's organization that collects, analyzes, and distributes collision avoidance analysis results.
              (3) Collision avoidance analysis analysis results transmission medium. A launch operator must identify the transmission medium, such as voice, FAX, or e-mail, for receiving results from United States Strategic Command.
              (4) Requestor launch operator needs. A launch operator must indicate the types of analysis output formats required for establishing flight commit criteria for a launch:
              (i) Waits. All the times within the launch window during which flight must not be initiated.
              (ii) Windows. All the times within an overall launch window during which flight may be initiated.
              (5) Vector at injection. A launch operator must identify the vector at injection for each segment. “Vector at injection” identifies the position and velocity of all orbital or suborbital segments after the thrust for a segment has ended.
              (i) Epoch. The epoch time, in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), of the expected launch vehicle liftoff time.
              (ii) Position and velocity. The position coordinates in the EFG coordinate system measured in kilometers and the EFG components measured in kilometers per second, of each launch vehicle stage or payload after any burnout, jettison, or deployment.
              (6) Time of powered flight. The elapsed time in seconds, from liftoff to arrival at the launch vehicle vector at injection. The input data must include the time of powered flight for each stage or jettisoned component measured from liftoff.
              (7) Time span for launch window file (LWF). A launch operator must provide the following information regarding its launch window:
              (i) Launch window. The launch window measured in minutes from the initial proposed liftoff time.
              (ii) Time of powered flight. The time provided as required by paragraph (c)(6) of this section measured in minutes rounded up to the nearest integer minute.
              (iii) Screen duration. The time duration, after all thrusting periods of flight have ended, that a collision avoidance analysis must screen for potential conjunctions with manned or mannable orbital objects. Screen duration is measured in minutes and must be greater than or equal to 100 minutes for an orbital launch.
              (iv) Extra pad. An additional period of time for collision avoidance analysis screening to ensure the entire first orbit is screened for potential conjunctions with manned or mannable orbital objects. This time must be 10 minutes unless otherwise specified by United States Strategic Command.
              (v) Total. The summation total of the time spans provided as required by paragraphs (c)(7)(i) through (c)(7)(iv) expressed in minutes.
              (8) Screening. A launch operator must select spherical or ellipsoidal screening as defined in this paragraph for determining any conjunction. The default must be the spherical screening method using an avoidance radius of 200 kilometers for manned or mannable orbiting objects. If the launch operator requests screening for any unmanned or unmannable objects, the default must be the spherical screening method using a miss distance of 25 kilometers.
              (i) Spherical screening. Spherical screening utilizes an impact exclusion sphere centered on each orbiting object's center-of-mass to determine any conjunction. A launch operator must specify the avoidance radius for manned or mannable objects and for any unmanned or unmannable objects if the launch operator elects to perform the analysis for unmanned or unmannable objects.
              (ii) Ellipsoidal screening. Ellipsoidal screening utilizes an impact exclusion ellipsoid of revolution centered on the orbiting object's center-of-mass to determine any conjunction. A launch operator must provide input in the UVW coordinate system in kilometers. The launch operator must provide delta-U measured in the radial-track direction, delta-V measured in the in-track direction, and delta-W measured in the cross-track direction.
              (9) Orbiting objects to evaluate. A launch operator must identify the orbiting objects to be included in the analysis.
              (10) Deliverable schedule/need dates. A launch operator must identify the times before flight, referred to as “L-times,” for which the launch operator requests a collision avoidance analysis.
              (d) Collision avoidance assessment products. A launch operator must file its collision avoidance analysis products as required by § 417.203(e) and must include the input data required by paragraph (c) of this section. A launch operator must incorporate the result of the collision avoidance analysis into its flight commit criteria established as required by § 417.113.

              B417.1 Scope
              This appendix contains requirements to establish aircraft hazard areas, ship hazard areas, and land impact hazard areas. The methodologies contained in this appendix represent an acceptable means of satisfying the requirements of § 417.107 and § 417.223 as they pertain to ship, aircraft, and land hazard areas. This appendix provides a standard and a measure of fidelity against which the FAA will measure any proposed alternative approaches. Requirements for a launch operator's implementation of a hazard area are contained in §§ 417.121(e) and (f).
              B417.3 Hazard area notifications and surveillance
              (a) A launch operator must ensure the following notifications have been made and adhered to at launch:
              (1) A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) must be issued for every aircraft hazard area identified as required by sections B417.5 and B417.7. The NOTAM must be effective no less than thirty minutes prior to flight and effective until no sooner than thirty minutes after the air space volume requested by the NOTAM can no longer be affected by the launch vehicle or its potential hazardous effects.
              (2) A Notice to Mariners (NOTMAR) must be issued for every ship hazard area identified as required by sections B417.5 and B417.7. The NOTMAR must be effective no less than thirty minutes prior to flight and effective until no sooner than thirty minutes after the area requested by the NOTMAR can no longer be affected by the launch vehicle or its potential hazardous effects.
              (3) All local officials and landowners adjacent to any hazard area must be notified of the flight schedule no less than two days prior to the flight of the launch vehicle.
              (b) A launch operator must survey each of the following hazard areas:
              (1) Each launch site hazard area;
              (2) Each aircraft hazard area in the vicinity of the launch site; and
              (3) Each ship hazard area in the vicinity of the launch site.
              B417.5 Launch site hazard area
              (a) General. A launch operator must perform a launch site hazard area analysis that protects the public, aircraft, and ships from the hazardous activities in the vicinity of the launch site. The launch operator must evacuate and monitor each launch site hazard area to ensure compliance with §§ 417.107(b)(2) and (b)(3).
              (b) Launch site hazard area analysis input. A launch site hazard area must encompass no less than the following:

              (2) Each ship hazard area in the vicinity of the launch site calculated as required by section B417.11(c); and
              (3) The aircraft hazard area in the vicinity of the launch site calculated as required by section B417.9(c).
              B417.7 Downrange hazard areas
              (a) General. A launch operator must perform a downrange hazard area analysis that protects the public, aircraft, and ships from the hazardous activities in the vicinity of each scheduled impact location.
              (b) Downrange hazard areas analysis input. A launch hazard area must bound no less than the following:

              (c) Methodology for computing an aircraft hazard area in the vicinity of the launch site. An aircraft hazard area analysis must determine an aircraft hazard area that encompasses the launch point from the surface of the Earth to an altitude of 100,000 ft MSL and wholly contains the launch vehicle's normal trajectory plus five nautical miles in every radial direction. A launch operator must calculate an aircraft hazard area in the vicinity of the launch site as follows:

A launch operator must compute an aircraft hazard area in the vicinity of each planned impact location as follows:
              (1) The analysis must calculate a three-sigma dispersion ellipse by determining the three-sigma impact limit around a planned impact location.
              (2) Taking the three-sigma dispersion ellipse calculated as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, plot a co-centric ellipse in the xy plane where the major and minor axes are 10nm longer than the major and minor axes of the three-sigma dispersion ellipse.
              (3) Extend the ellipse calculated as required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section from the surface to an infinite altitude.
              (4) Using the trajectory that predicts the instantaneous impact locations required in section A417.7(g)(7)(xii) or section C417.3(d), find the location on the trajectory where the vehicle's nominal altitude is predicted to be 100,000 ft MSL.
              (5) At the trajectory time where the altitude is represented as 100,000 ft MSL, select the corresponding points from the normal trajectory dispersion that are the farthest uprange, downrange, right crossrange, and left crossrange relative to the nominal trajectory.
              (6) Construct a box in the xy plane that includes two lines parallel to the azimuth, two lines perpendicular to the azimuth, and contains the points selected as required by paragraph (d)(5) of this section and the nominal impact point.
              (7) Extend the box constructed as required by paragraph (d)(6) of this section from the surface of the Earth to an infinite altitude.
              (8) Construct a volume, the aircraft hazard area, that encompasses the volumes calculated as required by paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(7) of this section.
              B417.11 Ship hazard areas analysis
              (a) General. A flight hazard area analysis must establish ship hazard areas bound by the 1 × 10−5 ship impact contour in the vicinity of the launch site and the vehicle's three-sigma dispersion limit plus a 5 nm buffer in the vicinity of a planned, downrange impact location.
              (b) Ship hazard area analysis input. A launch operator must account for the following inputs to determine the ship hazard areas:

              (5) The debris risk analysis performed as required by section A417.25 or section C417.9.
              (c) Methodology for computing ship hazard areas in the vicinity of the launch site. The analysis must establish the ship-hit contours as follows:
              (1) A ship-hit contour must account for the size of the largest ship that could be located in the ship hazard area. The analysis must demonstrate that the ship size used represents the largest ship that could be present in the ship hazard area or, if the ship size is unknown, the analysis must use a ship size of 120,000 square feet.

              (2) The analysis must first calculate the probability of impacting the reference ship selected as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section at the location of interest. From the location of interest, move the ship away from the launch location along a single radial until the probability that debris is present at that location multiplied by the probability that a ship is at that location is less than or equal to 1 × 10−5. When calculating the probability of impacting a ship, an impact occurs when:
              (i) The analysis predicts that inert debris will directly impact the vessel with a mean expected kinetic energy at impact greater than or equal to 11 ft-lbs; or
              (ii) The analysis predicts the peak incident overpressure at the reference vessel will be greater than or equal to 1.0 psi due to any explosive debris impact.
              (3) The analysis must account for:
              (i) The variance in winds;
              (ii) The aerodynamic properties of the debris;
              (iii) The variance in velocity of the debris;
              (iv) Guidance and performance errors;
              (v) The type of vehicle breakup, either by any flight termination system or by aerodynamic forces that may result in different debris characteristics; and
              (vi) Debris impact dispersion resulting from vehicle breakup and the malfunction turn capabilities of the launch vehicle.

              (4) Repeat the process outlined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section while varying the radial direction until enough locations are found where the reference ship's probability of impact is less than or equal to 1 × 10−5 such that connecting each location will result in a smooth and continuous contour.
              (d) Methodology for computing ship hazard areas in the vicinity of each planned water impact location. A launch operator must compute a ship hazard area in the vicinity of each planned impact location as required by the following:
              (1) The analysis must calculate a three-sigma dispersion ellipse by determining the three-sigma impact limit around a planned impact location.
              (2) Taking the three-sigma dispersion ellipse calculated as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, plot a co-centric ellipse in the xy plane where the major and minor axes are 10 nm longer than the major and minor axes of the three-sigma dispersion ellipse.
              B417.13 Land hazard areas analysis
              (a) General. A flight hazard area analysis must establish land hazard areas in the vicinity of the launch site and land hazard areas in the vicinity of each land impact location to ensure that the probability of a member of the public being struck by debris satisfies the probability threshold of 1 × 10−6 required by § 417.107(b) and to determine exclusion areas that may require entry control and surveillance prior to initiation of flight. The analysis must establish a land impact hazard area that accounts for the effects of impacting debris resulting from normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight, except for toxic effects, and accounts for potential impact locations of all debris fragments. The land hazard area must encompass all individual casualty contours and the near-launch-point blast hazard area calculated as required by paragraph (c) of this section. A launch operator may initiate flight only if no member of the public is present within the land hazard area.
              (b) Land hazard areas analysis input. A land hazard analysis must account for the following inputs to determine the land hazard area:
              (1) The trajectory analysis performed as required by section A417.7 or section C417.3;
              (2) For a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, the malfunction turn analysis required by section A417.9;
              (3) The debris analysis required by section A417.11 or section C417.7 to define the impact locations of each class of debris established by the debris analysis;
              (4) For a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, the time delay analysis required by section A417.21; and
              (5) The debris risk analysis performed as required by section A417.25 or section C417.9.
              (c) Methodology for computing land hazard areas in the vicinity of the launch site and in the vicinity of each planned land impact location. The analysis must establish a land hazard area as follows:

              (1) Each land hazard area must completely encompass all individual casualty contours that define where the risk to an individual would exceed the expected casualty (Ec) criteria of 1 × 10−6 if one person were assumed to be in the open and inside the contour during launch vehicle flight. The analysis must produce an individual casualty contour as follows:

              (i) The analysis must account for the location of a hypothetical person, and must vary the location of the person to determine when the risk would exceed the Ec criteria of 1 × 10−6. The analysis must count a person as a casualty when the person's location is subjected to any inert debris impact with a mean expected kinetic energy greater than or equal to 11 ft-lbs or a peak incident overpressure equal to or greater than 1.0 psi due to explosive debris impact. The analysis must determine the peak incident overpressure using the Kingery-Bulmash relationship, without regard to sheltering, reflections, or atmospheric effects.
              (ii) The analysis must account for all person locations that are no more than 1000 feet apart in the downrange direction and no more than 1000 feet apart in the crossrange direction to produce an individual casualty contour. For each person location, the analysis must sum all the probabilities of casualty over all flight times for all debris groups.
              (iii) An individual casualty contour must consist of curves that are smooth and continuous. To accomplish this, the analysis must vary the time interval between each trajectory time assessed so that each location of a debris impact point is less than one-half sigma of the downrange dispersion distance.
              (2) The input for determining a land impact hazard area must account for the following in order to define the impact locations of each class of debris established by the debris analysis and the time delay analysis required by section A417.21 for a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system:
              (i) The results of the trajectory analysis required by section A417.7 or section C417.3;
              (ii) The malfunction turn analysis required by section A417.9 for a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system; and
              (iii) The debris analysis required by section A417.11 or section C417.7.
              (3) The analysis must account for the extent of the impact debris dispersions for each debris class produced by normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight at each trajectory time. The analysis must also account for how the vehicle breaks up, either by any flight termination system or by aerodynamic forces, if the different breakup may result in a different probability of existence for each debris class. A land impact hazard area must account for each impacting debris fragment classified as required by section A417.11(c) or section C417.7.
              (4) For a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, the analysis must account for launch vehicle flight that exceeds a flight safety limit. The analysis must also account for trajectory conditions that maximize the mean debris impact distance during the flight safety system delay time determined as required by section A417.21 and account for a debris model that is representative of a flight termination or aerodynamic breakup.
              (5) For each launch vehicle breakup event, the analysis must account for trajectory and breakup dispersions, variations in debris class characteristics, and debris dispersion due to any wind condition under which a launch would be attempted.
              (6) The analysis must account for the probability of failure of each launch vehicle stage and the probability of existence of each debris class. The analysis must account for the probability of occurrence of each type of launch vehicle failure. The analysis must account for each vehicle failure probabilities that vary depending on the time of flight.
              (7) In addition to failure debris, the analysis must account for nominal jettisoned body debris impacts and the corresponding debris impact dispersions. The analysis must use a probability of occurrence of 1.0 for the planned debris fragments produced by normal separation events during flight.
              (d) Near-launch-point blast hazard area. A land hazard area analysis must define a blast overpressure hazard area as a circle extending from the launch point with a radius equal to the 1.0 psi overpressure distance produced by the equivalent TNT weight of the explosive capability of the vehicle. In addition, the analysis must establish a minimum near-launch point blast hazard area to provide protection from hazardous fragments potentially propelled by an explosion. The analysis must account for the maximum possible total solid and liquid propellant explosive potential of the launch vehicle and any payload. The analysis must define a blast overpressure hazard area using the following equations:
              
              Rop = 45 · (NEW)1/3
              
              
              Where:
              
              Rop is the over pressure distance in feet.
              NEW = WE · C (pounds).
              WE is the weight of the explosive in pounds.
              C is the TNT equivalency coefficient of the propellant being evaluated. A launch operator must identify the TNT equivalency of each propellant on its launch vehicle including any payload. TNT equivalency data for common liquid propellants is provided in tables A417-1. Table A417-2 provides factors for converting gallons of specified liquid propellants to pounds.
              
              (e) Other hazards. A flight hazard area analysis must identify any additional hazards, such as radioactive material, that may exist on the launch vehicle or payload. For each such hazard, the analysis must determine a hazard area that encompasses any debris impact point and its dispersion and includes an additional hazard radius that accounts for potential casualty due to the additional hazard. Analysis requirements for toxic release and far field blast overpressure are provided in sections A417.27 and A417.29, respectively.
              
              (f) Land impact dispersion ellipses. A land impact hazard area must contain the land impact dispersion ellipse for each planned land impact. A launch operator must compute a land impact dispersion ellipse in the vicinity of each planned land impact location as follows:
              (1) The analysis must calculate a one-sigma dispersion ellipse by determining the one-sigma impact limit around a planned impact location.
              (2) Taking the one-sigma dispersion ellipse calculated as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, plot a co-centric ellipse in the xy plane where the major and minor axes are 10nm longer than the major and minor axes of the one-sigma dispersion ellipse.

              (a) This appendix contains methodologies for performing the flight safety analysis required for the launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle flown with a wind weighting safety system, except for the hazard area analysis required by § 417.107, which is covered in appendix B of this part. This appendix includes methodologies for a trajectory analysis, wind weighting analysis, debris analysis, debris risk analysis, and a collision avoidance analysis.
              (b) The requirements of this appendix apply to a launch operator and the launch operator's flight safety analysis unless the launch operator clearly and convincingly demonstrates that an alternative approach provides an equivalent level of safety.
              (c) A launch operator must:
              (1) Perform a flight safety analysis to determine the launch parameters and conditions under which an unguided suborbital launch vehicle may be flown using a wind weighting safety system as required by § 417.233.
              (2) When conducting the flight safety analysis, comply with the safety criteria and operational requirements contained in § 417.125; and
              (3) Conduct the flight safety analysis for an unguided suborbital launch vehicle using the methodologies of this appendix and appendix B of this part unless the launch operator demonstrates, in accordance with § 406.3(b), through the licensing process, that an alternate method provides an equivalent level of fidelity.
              C417.3 Trajectory analysis

              (1) The launch vehicle's nominal trajectory;
              (2) Each nominal drag impact point; and
              (3) Each potential three-sigma dispersion about each nominal drag impact point.
              (b) Definitions. A launch operator must employ the following definitions when determining an unguided suborbital launch vehicle's trajectory and drag impact points:
              (1) Drag impact point means the intersection of a predicted ballistic trajectory of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle stage or other impacting component with the Earth's surface. A drag impact point reflects the effects of atmospheric influences as a function of drag forces and mach number.
              (2) Maximum range trajectory means an optimized trajectory, extended through fuel exhaustion of each stage, to achieve a maximum downrange drag impact point.
              (3) Nominal trajectory means the trajectory that an unguided suborbital launch vehicle will fly if all rocket aerodynamic parameters are as expected without error, all rocket internal and external systems perform exactly as planned, and there are no external perturbing influences, such as winds, other than atmospheric drag and gravity.
              (4) Normal flight means all possible trajectories of a properly performing unguided suborbital launch vehicle whose drag impact point location does not deviate from its nominal location more than three sigma in each of the uprange, downrange, left crossrange, or right crossrange directions.
              (5) Performance error parameter means a quantifiable perturbing force that contributes to the dispersion of a drag impact point in the uprange, downrange, and cross-range directions of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle stage or other impacting launch vehicle component. Performance error parameters for the launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle reflect rocket performance variations and any external forces that can cause offsets from the nominal trajectory during normal flight. Performance error parameters include thrust, thrust misalignment, specific impulse, weight, variation in firing times of the stages, fuel flow rates, contributions from the wind weighting safety system employed, and winds.
              (c) Input. A trajectory analysis requires the input necessary to produce a six-degree-of-freedom trajectory. A launch operator must use each of the following as inputs to the trajectory computations:

              (6) Wind errors. Error in measurement of wind direction as a function of altitude and wind magnitude as a function of altitude, wind forecast error, such as error due to time delay from wind measurement to launch.
              (d) Methodology for determining the nominal trajectory and nominal drag impact points. A launch operator must employ the steps in paragraphs (d)(1)-(d)(3) of this section to determine the nominal trajectory and the nominal drag impact point locations for each impacting rocket stage and component:
              (1) A launch operator must identify each performance error parameter associated with the unguided suborbital launch vehicle's design and operation and the value for each parameter that reflect nominal rocket performance. A launch operator must identify each performance error parameter's distribution to account for all launch vehicle performance variations and any external forces that can cause offsets from the nominal trajectory during normal flight. These performance error parameters include thrust misalignment, thrust variation, weight variation, fin misalignment, impulse variation, aerodynamic drag variation, staging timing variation, stage separation-force variation, drag error, uncompensated wind, launcher elevation angle error, launcher azimuth angle error, launcher tip-off, and launcher location error.
              (2) A launch operator must perform a no-wind trajectory simulation using a six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) trajectory simulation with all performance error parameters set to their nominal values to determine the impact point of each stage or component. The 6-DOF trajectory simulation must provide rocket position translation along three axes of an orthogonal Earth-centered coordinate system and rocket orientation in roll, pitch and yaw. The 6-DOF trajectory simulation must compute each translation and orientation in response to forces and moments internal and external to the rocket including all the effects of the input data required by paragraph (c) of this section. A launch operator may incorporate the following assumptions in a 6-DOF trajectory simulation:
              (i) The airframe may be treated as a rigid body.
              (ii) The airframe may have a plane of symmetry coinciding with the vertical plane of reference.
              (iii) The vehicle may have aerodynamic symmetry in roll.
              (iv) The airframe may have six degrees-of-freedom.
              (v) The aerodynamic forces and moments may be functions of mach number and may be linear with small flow incidence angles of attack.
              (3) A launch operator must tabulate the geodetic latitude and longitude of the launch vehicle's nominal drag impact point as a function of trajectory time and the final nominal drag impact point of each planned impacting stage or component.
              (e) Methodology for determining maximum downrange drag impact points. A launch operator must compute the maximum possible downrange drag impact point for each launch vehicle stage and impacting component. A launch operator must use the nominal drag impact point methodology, as defined by paragraph (d) of this section, modified to optimize the unguided suborbital launch vehicle's performance and flight profile to create the conditions for a maximum downrange drag impact point, including fuel exhaustion for each stage and impacting component.
              (f) Methodology for computing drag impact point dispersions. A launch operator must employ the steps in paragraphs (f)(1)-(f)(3) of this section when determining the dispersions in terms of drag impact point distance standard deviations in uprange, downrange, and crossrange direction from the nominal drag impact point location for each stage and impacting component:

              (1) For each stage of flight, a launch operator must identify the plus and minus one-sigma values for each performance error parameter identified as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section (i.e., nominal value plus one standard deviation and nominal value minus one standard deviation). A launch operator must determine the dispersion in downrange, uprange, and left and right crossrange for each impacting stage and component. A launch operator may either perform a Monte Carlo analysis that accounts for the distribution of each performance error parameter or determine the dispersion by a root-sum-square method under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
              (2) When using a root-sum-square method to determine dispersion, a launch operator must determine the deviations for a given stage by evaluating the deviations produced in that stage due to the performance errors in that stage and all preceding stages of the launch vehicle as illustrated in Table C417-1, and by computing the square root of the sum of the squares of each deviation caused by each performance error parameter's one sigma dispersion for each stage in each of the right crossrange, left crossrange, uprange and downrange directions. A launch operator must evaluate the performance errors for one stage at a time, with the performance of all subsequent stages assumed to be nominal. A launch operator's root-sum-square method must incorporate the following requirements:
              
                ER25AU06.012
              
              
              (i) With the 6-DOF trajectory simulation used to determine nominal drag impact points as required by paragraph (d) of this section, perform a series of trajectory simulation runs for each stage and planned ejected debris, such as a fairing, payload, or other component, and, for each simulation, model only one performance error parameter set to either its plus or minus one-sigma value. For a given simulation run, set all other performance error parameters to their nominal values. Continue until achieving a trajectory simulation run for each plus one-sigma performance error parameter value and each minus one-sigma performance error parameter value for the stage or the planned ejected debris being evaluated. For each trajectory simulation run and for each impact being evaluated, tabulate the downrange, uprange, left crossrange, and right crossrange drag impact point distance deviations measured from the nominal drag impact point location for that stage or planned debris.
              (ii) For uprange, downrange, right crossrange, and left crossrange, compute the square root of the sum of the squares of the distance deviations in each direction. The square root of the sum of the squares distance value for each direction represents the one-sigma drag impact point dispersion in that direction. For a multiple stage rocket, perform the first stage series of simulation runs with all subsequent stage performance error parameters set to their nominal value. Tabulate the uprange, downrange, right crossrange, and left crossrange distance deviations from the nominal impact for each subsequent drag impact point location caused by the first stage one-sigma performance error parameter. Use these deviations in determining the total drag impact point dispersions for the subsequent stage impacts as described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section.
              (iii) For each subsequent stage impact of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle, determine the one-sigma impact dispersions by first determining the one-sigma distance deviations for that stage impact caused by each preceding stage as described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. Then perform a series of simulation runs and tabulate the uprange, downrange, right crossrange, and left crossrange drag impact point distance deviations as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section for that stage's one-sigma performance error parameter values with the preceding stage performance parameters set to nominal values. For each uprange, downrange, right crossrange, and left crossrange direction, compute the square root of the sum of the squares of the stage impact distance deviations due to that stage's and each preceding stage's one-sigma performance error parameter values. This square root of the sum of the squares distance value for each direction represents the total one-sigma drag impact point dispersion in that direction for the nominal drag impact point location of that stage. Use these deviations when determining the total drag impact point dispersions for the subsequent stage impacts.
              (3) A launch operator must determine a three-sigma dispersion area for each impacting stage or component as an ellipse that is centered at the nominal drag impact point location and has semi-major and semi-minor axes along the uprange, downrange, left crossrange, and right crossrange axes. The length of each axis must be three times as large as the total one-sigma drag impact point dispersions in each direction.
              (g) Trajectory analysis products for a suborbital launch vehicle. A launch operator must file the following products of a trajectory analysis for an unguided suborbital launch vehicle with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e):
              (1) A description of the process that the launch operator used for performing the trajectory analysis, including the number of simulation runs and the process for any Monte Carlo analysis performed.
              (2) A description of all assumptions and procedures the launch operator used in deriving each of the performance error parameters and their standard deviations.
              (3) Launch point origin data: name, geodetic latitude (+N), longitude (+E), geodetic height, and launch azimuth measured clockwise from true north.
              (4) Name of reference ellipsoid Earth model used. If a launch operator employs a reference ellipsoid Earth model other than WGS-84, Department of Defense World Geodetic System, Military Standard 2401 (Jan. 11, 1994), the launch operator must identify the semi-major axis, semi-minor axis, eccentricity, flattening parameter, gravitational parameter, rotation angular velocity, gravitational harmonic constants (e.g., J2, J3, J4), and mass of Earth.
              (5) If a launch operator converts latitude and longitude coordinates between different ellipsoidal Earth models to complete a trajectory analysis, the launch operator must file the equations for geodetic datum conversions and a sample calculation for converting the geodetic latitude and longitude coordinates between the models employed.

              (6) A launch operator must file tabular data that lists each performance error parameter used in the trajectory computations and each performance error parameter's plus and minus one-sigma values. If the launch operator employs a Monte Carlo analysis method for determining the dispersions about the nominal drag impact point, the tabular data must list the total one-sigma drag impact point distance deviations in each direction for each impacting stage and component. If the launch operator employs the square root of the sum of the squares method of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the tabular data must include the one-sigma drag impact point distance deviations in each direction due to each one-sigma performance error parameter value for each impacting stage and component.
              (7) A launch operator must file a graphical depiction showing geographical landmasses and the nominal and maximum range trajectories from liftoff until impact of the final stage. The graphical depiction must plot trajectory points in time intervals of no greater than one second during thrusting flight and for times corresponding to ignition, thrust termination or burnout, and separation of each stage or impacting body. If there are less than four seconds between stage separation or other jettison events, a launch operator must reduce the time intervals between plotted trajectory points to 0.2 seconds or less. The graphical depiction must show total launch vehicle velocity as a function of time, present-position ground-range as a function of time, altitude above the reference ellipsoid as a function of time, and the static stability margin as a function of time.
              (8) A launch operator must file tabular data that describes the nominal and maximum range trajectories from liftoff until impact of the final stage. The tabular data must include the time after liftoff, altitude above the reference ellipsoid, present position ground range, and total launch vehicle velocity for ignition, burnout, separation, booster apogee, and booster impact of each stage or impacting body. The launch operator must file the tabular data for the same time intervals required by paragraph (g)(7) of this section.
              (9) A launch operator must file a graphical depiction showing all geographical landmasses and the unguided suborbital launch vehicle's drag impact point for the nominal trajectory, the maximum impact range boundary, and the three-sigma drag impact point dispersion area for each impacting stage or component. The graphical depiction must show the following in relationship to each other: The nominal trajectory, a circle whose radius represents the range to the farthest downrange impact point that results from the maximum range trajectory, and the three-sigma drag impact point dispersions for each impacting stage and component.
              (10) A launch operator must file tabular data that describes the nominal trajectory, the maximum impact range boundary, and each three-sigma drag impact point dispersion area. The tabular data must include the geodetic latitude (positive north of the equator) and longitude (positive east of the Greenwich Meridian) of each point describing the nominal drag impact point positions, the maximum range circle, and each three-sigma impact dispersion area boundary. Each three-sigma dispersion area must be described by no less than 20 coordinate pairs. All coordinates must be rounded to the fourth decimal point.
              C417.5 Wind weighting analysis
              (a) General. As part of a wind weighting safety system, a launch operator must perform a wind weighting analysis to determine launcher azimuth and elevation settings that correct for the windcocking and wind-drift effects on an unguided suborbital launch vehicle due to forecasted winds in the airspace region of flight. A launch operator's wind weighting safety system and its operation must comply with § 417.125(c). The launch azimuth and elevation settings resulting from a launch operator's wind weighting analysis must produce a trajectory, under actual wind conditions, that results in a final stage drag impact point that is the same as the final stage's nominal drag impact point determined according to section C417.3(d).
              (b) Wind weighting analysis constraints. (1) A launch operator's wind weighting analysis must:
              (i) Account for the winds in the airspace region through which the rocket will fly. A launch operator's wind weighting safety system must include an operational method of determining the wind direction and wind magnitude at all altitudes that the rocket will reach up to the maximum altitude defined by dispersion analysis as required by section C417.3.
              (ii) Account for all errors due to the methods used to measure the winds in the airspace region of the launch, delay associated with wind measurement, and the method used to model the effects of winds. The resulting sum of these error components must be no greater than those used as the wind error dispersion parameter in the launch vehicle trajectory analysis performed as required by section C417.3.
              (iii) Account for the dispersion of all impacting debris, including any uncorrected wind error accounted for in the trajectory analysis performed as required by section C417.3.
              (iv) Establish flight commit criteria that are a function of the analysis and operational methods employed and reflect the maximum wind velocities and wind variability for which the results of the wind weighting analysis are valid.
              (v) Account for the wind effects during each thrusting phase of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle's flight and each ballistic phase of each rocket stage and component until burnout of the last stage.

              (vi) Determine the impact point location for any parachute recovery of a stage or component or the launch operator must perform a wind drift analysis to determine the parachute impact point location.
              (2) A launch operator must perform a wind weighting analysis using a six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) trajectory simulation that targets an impact point using an iterative process. The 6-DOF simulation must account for launch day wind direction and wind magnitude as a function of altitude.
              (3) A launch operator must perform a wind weighting analysis using a computer program or other method of editing wind data, recording the time the data was obtained, and recording the balloon number or identification of any other measurement device used for each wind altitude layer.
              (c) Methodology for performing a wind weighting analysis. A launch operator's method for performing a wind weighting analysis on the day of flight must account for the following:
              (1) A launch operator must measure the winds on the day of flight to determine wind velocity and direction. A launch operator's process for measuring winds must provide wind data that is consistent with any assumptions made in the launch operator's trajectory and drag impact point dispersion analysis, as required by section C417.3, regarding the actual wind data available on the day of flight. Wind measurements must be made at altitude increments such that the maximum correction between any two measurements does not exceed 5%. Winds must be measured from the ground level at the launch point to a maximum altitude that is consistent with the launch operator's drag impact point dispersion analysis. The maximum wind measurement altitude must be that necessary to account for 99% of the wind effect on the impact dispersion point. A launch operator's wind measuring process must employ the use of balloons and radar tracking or balloons fitted with a Global Positioning System transceiver, and must account for the following:
              (i) Measure winds from ground level to an altitude of at least that necessary to account for 99% of the wind effect on the impact dispersion point within six hours before flight and after any weather front passes the launch site before liftoff. Repeat a wind measurement up to the maximum altitude whenever a wind measurement, for any given altitude, from a later balloon release is not consistent with a wind measurement, for the same altitude, from an earlier balloon release.
              (ii) Measure winds from ground level to an altitude of at least that necessary to account for 95% of the wind effect on the impact dispersion point within four hours before flight and after any weather front passes the launch site before liftoff. Repeat a wind measurement to the 95% wind effect altitude whenever a wind measurement, for any given altitude, from a later lower altitude balloon release is not consistent with the wind measurement, for the same altitude, from the 95% wind effect altitude balloon release.
              (iii) Measure winds from ground level to an altitude of no less than that necessary to account for 80% of the wind effect on the impact dispersion point twice within 30 minutes of liftoff. Use the first measurement to set launcher azimuth and elevation, and the second measurement to verify the first measurement data.
              (2) A launch operator must perform runs of the 6-DOF trajectory simulation using the flight day measured winds as input and targeting for the nominal final stage drag impact point. In an iterative process, vary the launcher elevation angle and azimuth angle settings for each simulation run until the nominal final stage impact point is achieved. The launch operator must use the resulting launcher elevation angle and azimuth angle settings to correct for the flight day winds. The launch operator must not initiate flight unless the launcher elevation angle and azimuth angle settings after wind weighting are in accordance with the following:
              (i) The launcher elevation angle setting resulting from the wind weighting analysis must not exceed ±5° from the nominal launcher elevation angle setting and must not exceed a total of 86° for a proven launch vehicle, and 84° for an unproven launch vehicle. A launch operator's nominal launcher elevation angle setting must be as required by § 417.125(c)(3).
              (ii) The launcher azimuth angle setting resulting from the wind weighting analysis must not exceed + 30° from the nominal launcher azimuth angle setting unless the launch operator demonstrates clearly and convincingly, through the licensing process, that its unguided suborbital launch vehicle has a low sensitivity to high wind speeds, and the launch operator's wind weighting analysis and wind measuring process provide an equivalent level of safety.
              (3) Using the trajectory produced in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for each intermediate stage and planned ejected component, a launch operator must compute the impact point that results from wind drift by performing a run of the 6-DOF trajectory simulation with the launcher angles determined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the flight day winds from liftoff until the burnout time or ejection time of the stage or ejected component. The resulting impact point(s) must be accounted for when performing flight day ship-hit operations defined in section B417.11(c).

              (4) If a parachute is used for any stage or component, a launch operator must determine the wind drifted impact point of the stage or component using a trajectory simulation that incorporates modeling for the change in aerodynamics at parachute ejection. Perform this simulation run in addition to any simulation of spent stages without parachutes.
              (5) A launch operator must verify that the launcher elevation angle and azimuth angle settings at the time of liftoff are the same as required by the wind weighting analysis.
              (6) A launch operator must monitor and verify that any wind variations and maximum wind limits at the time of liftoff are within the flight commit criteria established according to § 417.113(c).
              (7) A launch operator must generate output data from its wind weighting analysis for each impacting stage or component in printed, plotted, or computer medium format. This data must include:
              (i) Launch day wind measurement data, including magnitude and direction.
              (ii) The results of each computer run made using the launch day wind measurement data, including but not limited to, launcher settings, and impact locations for each stage or component.
              (iii) Final launcher settings recorded.
              (d) Wind weighting analysis products. The products of a launch operator's wind weighting analysis filed with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e) must include the following:
              (1) A launch operator must file a description of its wind weighting analysis methods, including its method and schedule of determining wind speed and wind direction for each altitude layer.
              (2) A launch operator must file a description of its wind weighting safety system and identify all equipment used to perform the wind weighting analysis, such as any wind towers, balloons, or Global Positioning System wind measurement system employed and the type of trajectory simulation employed.
              (3) A launch operator must file a sample wind weighting analysis using actual or statistical winds for the launch area and provide samples of the output required by paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
              C417.7 Debris analysis
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a debris analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.211. This section applies to the debris data required by § 417.211 and the debris analysis products that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e).
              (b) Debris analysis constraints. A debris analysis must produce the debris model described in paragraph (c) of this section. The analysis must account for all launch vehicle debris fragments, individually or in groupings of fragments called classes. The characteristics of each debris fragment represented by a class must be similar enough to the characteristics of all the other debris fragments represented by that class that all the debris fragments of the class can be described by a single set of characteristics. Paragraph (c)(10) of this section applies when establishing a debris class. A debris model must describe the physical, aerodynamic, and harmful characteristics of each debris fragment either individually or as a member of a class. A debris model must consist of lists of individual debris or debris classes for each cause of breakup and any planned jettison of debris, launch vehicle components, or payload. A debris analysis must account for:
              (1) Debris due to any malfunction where forces on the launch vehicle may exceed the launch vehicle's structural integrity limits.
              (2) The immediate post-breakup or jettison environment of the launch vehicle debris, and any change in debris characteristics over time from launch vehicle breakup or jettison until debris impact.
              (3) The impact overpressure, fragmentation, and secondary debris effects of any confined or unconfined solid propellant chunks and fueled components containing either liquid or solid propellants that could survive to impact, as a function of vehicle malfunction time.
              (4) The effects of impact of the intact vehicle as a function of failure time. The intact impact debris analysis must identify the trinitrotoluene (TNT) yield of impact explosions, and the numbers of fragments projected from all such explosions, including non-launch vehicle ejecta and the blast overpressure radius. The analysis must use a model for TNT yield of impact explosion that accounts for the propellant weight at impact, the impact speed, the orientation of the propellant, and the impacted surface material.
              (c) Debris model. A debris analysis must produce a model of the debris resulting from planned jettison and from unplanned breakup of a launch vehicle for use as input to other analyses, such as establishing hazard areas and performing debris risk and toxic analyses. A launch operator's debris model must satisfy the following:
              (1) Debris fragments. A debris model must provide the debris fragment data required by this section for the launch vehicle flight from the planned ignition time until thrust termination of the last thrusting stage. A debris model must provide debris fragment data for the number of time periods sufficient to meet the requirements for smooth and continuous contours used to define hazard areas as required by appendix B of this part.
              (2) Inert fragments. A debris model must identify all inert fragments that are not volatile and that do not burn or explode under normal and malfunction conditions. A debris model must identify all inert fragments for each breakup time during flight corresponding to a critical event when the fragment catalog is significantly changed by the event. Critical events include staging, payload fairing jettison, and other normal hardware jettison activities.
              (3) Explosive and non-explosive propellant fragments. A debris model must identify all propellant fragments that are explosive or non-explosive upon impact. The debris model must describe each propellant fragment as a function of time, from the time of breakup through ballistic free-fall to impact. The debris model must describe the characteristics of each fragment, including its origin on the launch vehicle, representative dimensions and weight at the time of breakup and at the time of impact. For any fragment identified as an un-contained or contained propellant fragment, whether explosive or non-explosive, the debris model must identify whether or not it burns during free fall, and provide the consumption rate during free fall. The debris model must identify:
              (i) Solid propellant that is exposed directly to the atmosphere and that burns but does not explode upon impact as “un-contained non-explosive solid propellant.”
              (ii) Solid or liquid propellant that is enclosed in a container, such as a motor case or pressure vessel, and that burns but does not explode upon impact as “contained non-explosive propellant.”
              (iii) Solid or liquid propellant that is enclosed in a container, such as a motor case or pressure vessel, and that explodes upon impact as “contained explosive propellant fragment.”
              (iv) Solid propellant that is exposed directly to the atmosphere and that explodes upon impact as “un-contained explosive solid propellant fragment.”
              (4) Other non-inert debris fragments. In addition to the explosive and flammable fragments identified under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a debris model must identify any other non-inert debris fragments, such as toxic or radioactive fragments, that present any other hazards to the public.
              (5) Fragment weight. At each modeled breakup time, the individual fragment weights must approximately add up to the sum total weight of inert material in the vehicle and the weight of contained liquid propellants and solid propellants that are not consumed in the initial breakup or conflagration.
              (6) Fragment imparted velocity. A debris model must identify the maximum velocity imparted to each fragment due to potential explosion or pressure rupture. When accounting for imparted velocity, a debris model must:
              (i) Use a Maxwellian distribution with the specified maximum value equal to the 97th percentile; or
              (ii) Identify the distribution, and state whether or not the specified maximum value is a fixed value with no uncertainty.
              (7) Fragment projected area. A debris model must include each of the axial, transverse, and mean tumbling areas of each fragment. If the fragment may stabilize under normal or malfunction conditions, the debris model must also provide the projected area normal to the drag force.
              (8) Fragment ballistic coefficient. A debris model must include the axial, transverse, and tumble orientation ballistic coefficient for each fragment's projected area as required by paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
              (9) Debris fragment count. A debris model must include the total number of each type of fragment required by paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section and created by a malfunction.
              (10) Fragment classes. A debris model must categorize malfunction debris fragments into classes where the characteristics of the mean fragment in each class conservatively represent every fragment in the class. The model must define fragment classes for fragments whose characteristics are similar enough to be described and treated by a single average set of characteristics. A debris class must categorize debris by each of the following characteristics, and may include any other useful characteristics:
              (i) The type of fragment, defined by paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section. All fragments within a class must be the same type, such as inert or explosive.
              (ii) Debris subsonic ballistic coefficient (βsub). The difference between the smallest log10(βsub) value and the largest log10(βsub) value in a class must not exceed 0.5, except for fragments with βsub less than or equal to three. Fragments with βsub less than or equal to three may be grouped within a class.

              (iii) Breakup-imparted velocity (ΔV). A debris model must categorize fragments as a function of the range of ΔV for the fragments within a class and the class's median subsonic ballistic coefficient. For each class, the debris model must keep the ratio of the maximum breakup-imparted velocity (ΔVmax) to minimum breakup-imparted velocity (ΔVmin) within the following bound:
              
                ER25AU06.107
              
              Where:
              
              β′sub is the median subsonic ballistic coefficient for the fragments in a class.
              
              (d) Debris analysis products. The products of a debris analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e) must include:
              
              (1) Debris model. The launch operator's debris model that satisfies the requirements of this section.
              (2) Fragment description. A description of the fragments contained in the launch operator's debris model. The description must identify the fragment as a launch vehicle part or component, describe its shape, representative dimensions, and may include drawings of the fragment.
              (3) Intact impact TNT yield. For an intact impact of a launch vehicle, for each failure time, a launch operator must identify the TNT yield of each impact explosion and blast overpressure hazard radius.
              (4) Fragment class data. The class name, the range of values for each parameter used to categorize fragments within a fragment class, and the number of fragments in any fragment class established as required by paragraph (c)(10) of this section.
              (5) Ballistic coefficient. The mean ballistic coefficient (β) and plus and minus three-sigma values of the β for each fragment class. A launch operator must provide graphs of the coefficient of drag (Cd) as a function of Mach number for the nominal and three-sigma β variations for each fragment shape. The launch operator must label each graph with the shape represented by the curve and reference area used to develop the curve. A launch operator must provide a Cd vs. Mach curve for any axial, transverse, and tumble orientations for any fragment that will not stabilize during free-fall conditions. For any fragment that may stabilize during free-fall, a launch operator must provide Cd vs. Mach curves for the stability angle of attack. If the angle of attack where the fragment stabilizes is other than zero degrees, a launch operator must provide both the coefficient of lift (CL) vs. Mach number and the Cd vs. Mach number curves. The launch operator must provide the equations for each Cd vs. Mach curve.
              (6) Pre-flight propellant weight. The initial preflight weight of solid and liquid propellant for each launch vehicle component that contains solid or liquid propellant.
              (7) Normal propellant consumption. The nominal and plus and minus three-sigma solid and liquid propellant consumption rate, and pre-malfunction consumption rate for each component that contains solid or liquid propellant.
              (8) Fragment weight. The mean and plus and minus three-sigma weight of each fragment or fragment class.
              (9) Projected area. The mean and plus and minus three-sigma axial, transverse, and tumbling areas for each fragment or fragment class. This information is not required for those fragment classes classified as burning propellant classes under section A417.25(b)(8).
              (10) Imparted velocities. The maximum incremental velocity imparted to each fragment class created by explosive or overpressure loads at breakup. The launch operator must identify the velocity distribution as Maxwellian or must define the distribution, including whether or not the specified maximum value is a fixed value with no uncertainty.
              (11) Fragment type. The fragment type for each fragment established as required by paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section.
              (12) Origin. The part of the launch vehicle from which each fragment originated.
              (13) Burning propellant classes. The propellant consumption rate for those fragments that burn during free-fall.
              (14) Contained propellant fragments, explosive or non-explosive. For contained propellant fragments, whether explosive or non-explosive, a launch operator must provide the initial weight of contained propellant and the consumption rate during free-fall. The initial weight of the propellant in a contained propellant fragment is the weight of the propellant before any of the propellant is consumed by normal vehicle operation or failure of the launch vehicle.
              (15) Solid propellant fragment snuff-out pressure. The ambient pressure and the pressure at the surface of a solid propellant fragment, in pounds per square inch, required to sustain a solid propellant fragment's combustion during free-fall.
              (16) Other non-inert debris fragments. For each non-inert debris fragment identified as required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a launch operator must describe the diffusion, dispersion, deposition, radiation, and other hazard exposure characteristics used to determine the effective casualty area required by paragraph (c)(9) of this section.
              (17) Residual thrust dispersion. For each thrusting or non-thrusting stage having residual thrust capability following a launch vehicle malfunction, a launch operator must provide either the total residual impulse imparted or the full-residual thrust in foot-pounds as a function of breakup time. For any stage not capable of thrust after a launch vehicle malfunction, a launch operator must provide the conditions under which the stage is no longer capable of thrust. For each stage that can be ignited as a result of a launch vehicle malfunction on a lower stage, a launch operator must identify the effects and duration of the potential thrust, and the maximum deviation of the instantaneous impact point which can be brought about by the thrust.
              C417.9 Debris risk
              (a) General. A launch operator must perform a debris risk analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.225. This section applies to the computation of the average number of casualties (Ec) to the collective members of the public exposed to inert and explosive debris hazards from the proposed flight of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle as required by § 417.225 and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e).
              (b) Debris risk analysis constraints. The following constraints apply to debris risk:

              (1) A debris risk analysis must use valid risk analysis models that compute Ec as the summation over all trajectory time intervals from lift-off through impact of the products of the probability of each possible event and the casualty consequences due to debris impacts for each possible event.
              (2) A debris risk analysis must account for the following populations:
              (i) The overflight of populations located inside any flight hazard area.
              (ii) All populations located within five-sigma left and right crossrange of a nominal trajectory instantaneous impact point ground trace and within five-sigma of each planned nominal debris impact.
              (3) A debris risk analysis must account for both inert and explosive debris hazards produced from any impacting debris caused by normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight. The analysis must account for the debris classes determined by the debris analysis required by section A417.11. A debris risk analysis must account for any inert debris impact with mean expected kinetic energy at impact greater than or equal to 11 ft-lbs and peak incident overpressure of greater than or equal to 1.0 psi due to any explosive debris impact. The analysis must account for all debris hazards as a function of flight time.
              (4) A debris risk analysis must account for debris impact points and dispersion for each class of debris in accordance with the following:
              (i) A debris risk analysis must account for drag corrected impact points and dispersions for each class of impacting debris resulting from normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight as a function of trajectory time from lift-off through final impact.
              (ii) The dispersion for each debris class must account for the position and velocity state vector dispersions at breakup, the variance produced by breakup imparted velocities, the effects of winds on both the ascent trajectory state vector at breakup and the descending debris piece impact location, the variance produced by aerodynamic properties for each debris class, and any other dispersion variances.
              (iii) A debris risk analysis must account for the survivability of debris fragments that are subject to reentry aerodynamic forces or heating. A debris class may be eliminated from the debris risk analysis if the launch operator demonstrates that the debris will not survive to impact.
              (5) A debris risk analysis must account for launch vehicle failure probability. The following constraints apply:
              (i) For flight safety analysis purposes, a failure occurs when a vehicle does not complete any phase of normal flight or exhibits the potential for the stage or its debris to impact the Earth or reenter the atmosphere during the mission or any future mission of similar vehicle capability. Also, either a launch incident or launch accident constitutes a failure.
              (ii) For a launch vehicle with fewer than 2 flights completed, the analysis must use a reference value for the launch vehicle failure probability estimate equal to the upper limit of the 60% two-sided confidence limits of the binomial distribution for outcomes of all previous launches of vehicles developed and launched in similar circumstances. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for the level of experience demonstrated by the launch operator and other factors that affects the probability of failure. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate for the second launch based on evidence obtained from the first flight of the vehicle.
              (iii) For a launch vehicle with at least 2 flights completed, the analysis must use the reference value for the launch vehicle failure probability of Table C417-2 based on the outcomes of all previous launches of the vehicle. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for evidence obtained from the flight history of the vehicle. Failure probability estimate adjustments to the reference value may account for the nature of launch outcomes in the flight history of the vehicle, corrective actions taken in response to a failure of the vehicle, or other vehicle modifications that may affect reliability. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for the demonstrated quality of the engineering approach to launch vehicle processing. The analysis must use a final failure estimate within the confidence limits of Table C417-2.
              (A) Values listed on the far left of Table C417-2 apply when no launch failures are experienced. Values on the far right apply when only launch failures are experienced. Values in between apply for flight histories that include both failures and successes.
              (B) Reference values in Table C417-2 are shown in bold. The reference values are the median values between 60% two-sided confidence limits of the binomial distribution. For the special cases of zero or N failures in N launch attempts, the reference values may also be recognized as the median value between the 80% one-sided confidence limit of the binomial distribution and zero or one, respectively.

              (C) Upper and lower confidence bounds in Table C417-2 are shown directly above and below each reference value. These confidence bounds are based on 60% two-sided confidence limits of the binomial distribution. For the special cases of zero or N failures in N launch attempts, the upper and lower confidence bounds are based on the 80% one-sided confidence limit, respectively.
              
                ER25AU06.013
              
              (6) A debris risk analysis must account for the dwell time of the instantaneous impact point ground trace over each populated or protected area being evaluated.
              (7) A debris risk analysis must account for the three-sigma instantaneous impact point trajectory variations in left-crossrange, right-crossrange, uprange, and downrange as a function of trajectory time, due to launch vehicle performance variations as determined by the trajectory analysis performed as required by section C417.3.
              (8) A debris risk analysis must account for the effective casualty area as a function of launch vehicle flight time for all impacting debris generated from a catastrophic launch vehicle malfunction event or a planned impact event. The effective casualty area must:
              (i) Account for both payload and vehicle systems and subsystems debris;
              (ii) Account for all debris fragments determined as part of a launch operator's debris analysis as required by section A417.11;
              (iii) For each explosive debris fragment, account for a 1.0 psi blast overpressure radius and the projected debris effects for all potentially explosive debris; and
              (iv) For each inert debris fragment, account for bounce, skip, slide, and splatter effects; or equal seven times the maximum projected area of the fragment.
              (9) A debris risk analysis must account for current population density data obtained from a current population database for the region being evaluated or by estimating the current population using exponential population growth rate equations applied to the most current historical data available. The population model must define population centers that are similar enough to be described and treated as a single average set of characteristics without degrading the accuracy of the debris risk estimate.
              (c) Debris risk analysis products. The products of a debris risk analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA must include:
              (1) A debris risk analysis report that provides the analysis input data, probabilistic risk determination methods, sample computations, and text or graphical charts that characterize the public risk to geographical areas for each launch.
              (2) Geographic data showing:

              (i) The launch vehicle nominal, five-sigma left-crossrange and five-sigma right-crossrange instantaneous impact point ground traces;
              
              (ii) All exclusion zones relative to the instantaneous impact point ground traces; and
              (iii) All populated areas included in the debris risk analysis.
              (3) A discussion of each launch vehicle failure scenario accounted for in the analysis and the probability of occurrence, which may vary with flight time, for each failure scenario. This information must include failure scenarios where a launch vehicle:
              (i) Flies within normal limits until some malfunction causes spontaneous breakup; and
              (ii) Experiences malfunction turns.
              (4) A population model applicable to the launch overflight regions that contains the following: Region identification, location of the center of each population center by geodetic latitude and longitude, total area, number of persons in each population center, and a description of the shelter characteristics within the population center.
              (5) A description of the launch vehicle, including general information concerning the nature and purpose of the launch and an overview of the launch vehicle, including a scaled diagram of the general arrangement and dimensions of the vehicle. A launch operator's debris risk analysis products may reference other documentation filed with the FAA containing this information. The description must include:
              (i) Weights and dimensions of each stage.
              (ii) Weights and dimensions of any booster motors attached.
              (iii) The types of fuel used in each stage and booster.
              (iv) Weights and dimensions of all interstage adapters and skirts.
              (v) Payload dimensions, materials, construction, and any payload fuel; payload fairing construction, materials, and dimensions; and any non-inert components or materials that add to the effective casualty area of the debris, such as radioactive or toxic materials or high-pressure vessels.
              (6) A typical sequence of events showing times of ignition, cutoff, burnout, and jettison of each stage, firing of any ullage rockets, and starting and ending times of coast periods and control modes.
              (7) The following information for each launch vehicle motor:
              (i) Propellant type and composition;
              (ii) Vacuum thrust profile;
              (iii) Propellant weight and total motor weight as a function of time;
              (iv) A description of each nozzle and steering mechanism;
              (v) For solid rocket motors, internal pressure and average propellant thickness, or borehole radius, as a function of time;
              (vi) Burn rate; and
              (vii) Nozzle exit and entrance areas.
              (8) The launch vehicle's launch and failure history, including a summary of past vehicle performance. For a new vehicle with little or no flight history, a launch operator must provide all known data on similar vehicles that include:
              (i) Identification of the launches that have occurred;
              (ii) Launch date, location, and direction of each launch;
              (iii) The number of launches that performed normally;
              (iv) Behavior and impact location of each abnormal experience;
              (v) The time, altitude, and nature of each malfunction; and
              (vi) Descriptions of corrective actions taken, including changes in vehicle design, flight termination, and guidance and control hardware and software.
              (9) The values of probability of impact (PI) and expected casualty (Ec) for each populated area.
              C417.11 Collision avoidance
              (a) General. A flight safety analysis must include a collision avoidance analysis that satisfies the requirements of § 417.231. This section applies to a launch operator obtaining a collision avoidance assessment from United States Strategic Command as required by § 417.231 and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by § 417.203(e). United States Strategic Command refers to a collision avoidance analysis for a space launch as a conjunction on launch assessment.
              (b) Analysis not required. A collision avoidance analysis is not required if the maximum altitude attainable by the launch operator's unguided suborbital launch vehicle is less than the altitude of the lowest manned or mannable orbiting object. The maximum altitude attainable means an optimized trajectory, assuming 3-sigma maximum performance, extended through fuel exhaustion of each stage, to achieve a maximum altitude.
              (c) Analysis constraints. A launch operator must satisfy the following when obtaining and implementing the results of a collision avoidance analysis:
              (1) A launch operator must provide United States Strategic Command with the launch window and trajectory data needed to perform a collision avoidance analysis for a launch as required by paragraph (d) of this section, at least 15 days before the first attempt at flight. The FAA will identify a launch operator to United States Strategic Command as part of issuing a license and provide a launch operator with current United States Strategic Command contact information.
              (2) A launch operator must obtain a collision avoidance analysis performed by United States Strategic Command 6 hours before the beginning of a launch window.

              (3) A launch operator may use a collision avoidance analysis for 12 hours from the time that United States Strategic Command determines the state vectors of the manned or mannable orbiting objects. If a launch operator needs an updated collision avoidance analysis due to a launch delay, the launch operator must file the request with United States Strategic Command at least 12 hours prior to the beginning of the new launch window.
              (4) For every 90 minutes, or portion of 90 minutes, that pass between the time United States Strategic Command last determined the state vectors of the orbiting objects, a launch operator must expand each wait in a launch window by subtracting 15 seconds from the start of the wait in the launch window and adding 15 seconds to the end of the wait in the launch window. A launch operator must incorporate all the resulting waits in the launch window into its flight commit criteria established as required by § 417.113.
              (d) Information required. A launch operator must prepare a collision avoidance analysis worksheet for each launch using a standardized format that contains the input data required by this paragraph. A launch operator must file the input data with United States Strategic Command for the purposes of completing a collision avoidance analysis.
              (1) Launch information. A launch operator must file the following launch information:
              (i) Mission name. A mnemonic given to the launch vehicle/payload combination identifying the launch mission from all others.
              (ii) Segment number. A segment is defined as a launch vehicle stage or payload after the thrusting portion of its flight has ended. This includes the jettison or deployment of any stage or payload. A launch operator must provide a separate worksheet for each segment. For each segment, a launch operator must determine the “vector at injection” as defined by paragraph (d)(5) of this section. The data must present each segment number as a sequence number relative to the total number of segments for a launch, such as “1 of 5.”
              (iii) Launch window. The launch window opening and closing times in Greenwich Mean Time (referred to as ZULU time) and the Julian dates for each scheduled launch attempt.
              (2) Point of contact. The person or office within a launch operator's organization that collects, analyzes, and distributes collision avoidance analysis results.
              (3) Collision avoidance analysis results transmission medium. A launch operator must identify the transmission medium, such as voice, FAX, or e-mail, for receiving results from United States Strategic Command.
              (4) Requestor launch operator needs. A launch operator must indicate the types of analysis output formats required for establishing flight commit criteria for a launch:
              (i) Waits. All the times within the launch window during which flight must not be initiated.
              (ii) Windows. All the times within an overall launch window during which flight may be initiated.
              (5) Vector at injection. A launch operator must identify the vector at injection for each segment. “Vector at injection” identifies the position and velocity of all orbital or suborbital segments after the thrust for a segment has ended.
              (i) Epoch. The epoch time, in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), of the expected launch vehicle liftoff time.
              (ii) Position and velocity. The position coordinates in the EFG coordinate system measured in kilometers and the EFG components measured in kilometers per second, of each launch vehicle stage or payload after any burnout, jettison, or deployment.
              (6) Time of powered flight. The elapsed time in seconds, from liftoff to arrival at the launch vehicle vector at injection. The input data must include the time of powered flight for each stage or jettisoned component measured from liftoff.
              (7) Time span for launch window file (LWF). A launch operator must provide the following information regarding its launch window:
              (i) Launch window. The launch window measured in minutes from the initial proposed liftoff time.
              (ii) Time of powered flight. The time provided as required by paragraph (d)(6) of this section measured in minutes rounded up to the nearest integer minute.
              (iii) Screen duration. The time duration, after all thrusting periods of flight have ended, that a collision avoidance analysis must screen for potential conjunctions with manned or mannable orbital objects. Screen duration is measured in minutes.
              (iv) Extra pad. An additional period of time for collision avoidance analysis screening to ensure the entire trajectory time is screened for potential conjunctions with manned or mannable orbital objects. This time must be 10 minutes unless otherwise specified by United States Strategic Command.
              (v) Total. The summation total of the time spans provided as required by paragraphs (d)(7)(i) through (d)(7)(iv) expressed in minutes.
              (8) Screening. A launch operator must select spherical or ellipsoidal screening as defined in this paragraph for determining any conjunction. The default must be the spherical screening method using an avoidance radius of 200 kilometers for manned or mannable orbiting objects. If the launch operator requests screening for any unmanned or unmannable objects, the default must be the spherical screening method using a miss-distance of 25 kilometers.
              (i) Spherical screening. Spherical screening utilizes an impact exclusion sphere centered on each orbiting object's center-of-mass to determine any conjunction. A launch operator must specify the avoidance radius for manned or mannable objects and for any unmanned or unmannable objects if the launch operator elects to perform the analysis for unmanned or unmannable objects.
              (ii) Ellipsoidal screening. Ellipsoidal screening utilizes an impact exclusion ellipsoid of revolution centered on the orbiting object's center-of-mass to determine any conjunction. A launch operator must provide input in the UVW coordinate system in kilometers. The launch operator must provide delta-U measured in the radial-track direction, delta-V measured in the in-track direction, and delta-W measured in the cross-range direction.
              (9) Deliverable schedule/need dates. A launch operator must identify the times before flight, referred to as “L-times,” for which the launch operator requests a collision avoidance analysis.
              (e) Collision avoidance assessment products. A launch operator must file its collision avoidance analysis products as required by § 417.203(e) and must include the input data required by paragraph (d) of this section. A launch operator must incorporate the result of the collision avoidance analysis into its flight commit criteria established as required by § 417.113.
            
            
              Pt. 417, App. D
              Appendix D to Part 417—Flight Termination Systems, Components, Installation, and Monitoring
              D417.1 General
              This appendix applies to each flight termination system and the components that make up the system for each launch. Section 417.301 requires that a launch operator's flight safety system include a flight termination system that complies with this appendix. Section 417.301 also contains requirements that apply to a launch operator's demonstration of compliance with the requirements of this appendix.
              D417.3 Flight termination system functional requirements
              (a) When a flight safety system terminates the flight of a vehicle because it has either violated a flight safety rule as defined in § 417.113 or the vehicle inadvertently separates or destructs as described in section D417.11, a flight termination system must:
              (1) Render each propulsion system that has the capability of reaching a populated or other protected area, incapable of propulsion, without significant lateral or longitudinal deviation in the impact point. This includes each stage and any strap on motor or propulsion system that is part of any payload;
              (2) Terminate the flight of any inadvertently or prematurely separated propulsion system capable of reaching a populated or other protected area;
              (3) Destroy the pressure integrity of any solid propellant system to terminate all thrust or ensure that any residual thrust causes the propulsion system to tumble without significant lateral or longitudinal deviation in the impact point; and
              (4) Disperse any liquid propellant, whether by rupturing the propellant tank or other equivalent method, and initiate burning of any toxic liquid propellant.
              (b) A flight termination system must not cause any solid or liquid propellant to detonate.
              (c) The flight termination of a propulsion system must not interfere with the flight termination of any other propulsion system.
              D417.5 Flight termination system design
              (a) Reliability prediction. A flight termination system must have a predicted reliability of 0.999 at a confidence level of 95 percent. A launch operator must demonstrate the system's predicted reliability by satisfying the requirements for system reliability analysis of § 417.309(b).
              (b) Single fault tolerance. A flight termination system, including monitoring and checkout circuits, must not have a single failure point that would:
              (1) Inhibit functioning of the system during flight; or
              (2) Produce an inadvertent initiation of the system that would endanger the public.
              (c) Redundancy. A flight termination system must use redundant components that are structurally, electrically, and mechanically separated. Each redundant component's mounting on a launch vehicle, including location or orientation, must ensure that any failure that will damage, destroy or otherwise inhibit the operation of one redundant component will not inhibit the operation of the other redundant component and will not inhibit functioning of the system. Each of the following exceptions applies:
              (1) Any linear shaped charge need not be redundant if it initiates at both ends, and the initiation source for one end is not the same as the initiation source for the other end; or
              (2) Any passive component such as an antenna or radio frequency coupler need not be redundant if it satisfies the requirements of this appendix.
              (d) System independence. A flight termination system must operate independently of any other launch vehicle system. The failure of another launch vehicle system must not inhibit the functioning of a flight termination system. A flight termination system may share a component with another launch vehicle system, only if the launch operator demonstrates that sharing the component will not degrade the flight termination system's reliability. A flight termination system may share a connection with another system if the connection must exist to satisfy a flight termination system requirement, such as any connection needed to:
              (1) Accomplish flight termination system arming and safing;
              (2) Provide data to the telemetry system; or
              (3) Accomplish any engine shut-down.
              (e) Performance specifications for components and parts. Each flight termination system component and each part that can affect the reliability of a flight termination component during flight must have written performance specifications that show, and contain the details of, how the component or part satisfies the requirements of this appendix.
              (f) Ability to test. A flight termination system, including each component and associated ground support and monitoring equipment, must satisfy the tests required by appendix E of this part.
              (g) Software safety critical functions. The requirements of § 417.123 apply to any computing system, software or firmware that is associated with a flight termination system and performs a software safety critical function as defined in § 417.123.
              (h) Component storage, operating, and service life. Each flight termination system component must have a specified storage life, operating life, and service life and must satisfy all of the following:
              (1) Each component must satisfy all its performance specifications when subjected to the full length of its specified storage life, operating life, and service life; and
              (2) A component's storage, operating, or service life must not expire before flight. A launch operator may extend an ordnance component's service life by satisfying the service life extension tests of appendix E of this part.
              (i) Consistency of components. A launch operator must ensure that each flight component sample is manufactured using parts, materials, processes, quality controls, and procedures that are each consistent with the manufacture of each qualification test sample.
              D417.7 Flight termination system environment survivability
              (a) General. A flight termination system, including all of its components, mounting hardware, cables, and wires, must each satisfy all of their performance specifications when subjected to each maximum predicted operating and non-operating environment and environmental design margin required by this appendix. As an alternative to subjecting the flight termination system to the maximum predicted environments and margin for each dynamic operating environment, such as vibration or shock, a flight termination system need only satisfy all its performance specifications when subjected to an environmental level greater than the level that would cause structural breakup of the launch vehicle.
              (b) Maximum predicted environments. A launch operator must determine all maximum predicted non-operating and operating environments that a flight termination system, including each component, will experience before its safe flight state. This determination must be based on analysis, modeling, testing, or monitoring. Non-operating and operating environments include temperature, vibration, shock, acceleration, acoustic, and other environments that apply to a specific launch vehicle and launch site, such as humidity, salt fog, dust, fungus, explosive atmosphere, and electromagnetic energy. Both of the following apply:
              (1) Each maximum predicted vibration, shock, and thermal environment for a flight termination system component must include a margin that accounts for the uncertainty due to flight-to-flight variability and any analytical uncertainty. For a launch vehicle configuration for which there have been fewer than three flights, the margin must be no less than plus 3 dB for vibration, plus 4.5 dB for shock, and plus and minus 11 °C for thermal range; and
              (2) For a launch vehicle configuration for which there have been fewer than three flights, a launch operator must monitor flight environments at as many locations within the launch vehicle as needed to verify the maximum predicted flight environments for each flight termination system component. An exception is that the launch operator may obtain empirical shock environment data through ground testing. A launch operator must adjust each maximum predicted flight environment for any future launch to account for all data obtained through monitoring.
              (c) Thermal environment. A component must satisfy all its performance specifications when exposed to preflight and flight thermal cycle environments. A thermal cycle must begin with the component at ambient temperature. The cycle must continue as the component is heated or cooled to achieve the required dwell time at one extreme of the required thermal range, then to achieve the required dwell time at the other extreme, and then back to ambient temperature. Each cycle, including all dwell times, must be continuous without interruption by any other period of heating or cooling. Paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(6) of this section identify the required thermal range for each component. A thermal cycle must include no less than a one-hour dwell time at each temperature extreme. The thermal rate of change between the extremes must be no less than the maximum predicted thermal rate of change or 1 °C per minute, whichever is greater. For an ordnance device, the thermal cycle must include no less than a two-hour dwell time at each temperature extreme. The thermal rate of change between the extremes for an ordnance device must be no less than the maximum predicted thermal rate of change or 3 °C per minute, whichever is greater.
              (1) Acceptance-number of thermal cycles. For each component, the acceptance-number of thermal cycles must be no less than eight thermal cycles or 1.5 times the maximum number of thermal cycles that the component could experience during launch processing and flight, including all launch delays and recycling, rounded up to the nearest whole number, whichever is greater.
              (2) Passive components. A passive component must satisfy all its performance specifications when subjected to:
              (i) The acceptance-number of thermal cycles from one extreme of the maximum predicted thermal range to the other extreme; and

This appendix contains requirements for tests and analyses that apply to all flight termination systems and the components that make up each flight termination system. Section 417.301 requires that a launch operator's flight safety system employ a flight termination system that complies with this appendix. Section 417.301 also contains requirements that apply to a launch operator's demonstration of compliance with the requirement of this appendix. A launch operator must employ on its launch vehicle only those flight termination system components that satisfy the requirements of this appendix.
              (b) Component tests and analyses. A component must satisfy each test or analysis required by any table of this appendix to demonstrate that the component satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to non-operating and operating environments. A launch operator must identify and implement any additional test or analysis for any new technology or any unique application of an existing technology.
              (c) Test plans. Each test of a component, subsystem, or system must follow a written plan that specifies the test parameters, including pass/fail criteria, and a testing sequence that satisfy the requirements of this appendix. For any component that is used for more than one flight, the test plan must provide for component reuse qualification, refurbishment, and acceptance as required by section E417.7(g). The test plan must include any alternate procedures for testing a component when it is in place on the launch vehicle.
              (d) Test failures. If a test of a component results in a failure, the component does not satisfy the test requirement. Each of the following is a test failure:
              (1) Any component sample that does not satisfy a performance specification;
              (2) Any failure to accomplish a test objective;

              (4) Any unexpected change in the performance of a component sample occurring at any time during testing;
              (5) Any component sample that exhibits any sign that a part is stressed beyond its design limit, such as a cracked circuit board, bent clamps, worn part, or loose connector or screw, even if the component passes the final functional test;
              (6) When component examination shows any defect that could adversely affect the component's performance;
              (7) Any discontinuity or dropout in a measured performance parameter that could prevent the component from satisfying a performance specification;
              (8) Any inadvertent output; or
              (9) Any indication of internal component damage.
              (e) Failure analysis. In the event of a test failure, the test item, procedures and equipment must undergo a written failure analysis. The failure analysis must identify the cause of the failure, the mechanism of the failure, and isolate the failure to the smallest replaceable item or items and ensure that there are no generic design, workmanship, or process problems with other flight components of similar configuration.
              (f) Test tolerances. Each test must apply to the nominal values specified by this appendix tolerances that satisfy the following:
              (1) The tolerance of any measurement taken during a functional test must provide the accuracy needed to detect any out-of-family or out-of-specification anomaly.
              (2) An environmental level, such as for vibration or temperature, used to satisfy a component test requirement of this appendix must include the environment design margin required by appendix D of this part. The environmental level must account for any test equipment tolerance to ensure that the component experiences the required margin.

If a repair requires disassembly of the component or soldering operations, the component must repeat any test necessary to demonstrate that the repair corrected the original anomaly and did not cause other damage. The total number of acceptance tests experienced by a repaired component must not exceed the environments for which the component is qualified.
              (i) Test and analysis reports. A launch operator must prepare or obtain one or more written reports that:

              Appendix G to Part 417—Natural and Triggered Lightning Flight Commit Criteria
              G417.1 General
              This appendix provides flight commit criteria for mitigating against natural lightning strikes and lightning triggered by the flight of a launch vehicle through or near an electrified environment. A launch operator may not initiate flight unless the weather conditions at the time of launch satisfy all lightning flight commit criteria of this appendix.
              (a) In order to meet the lightning flight commit criteria, a launch operator must employ any:
              (1) Weather monitoring and measuring equipment needed, and
              (2) Procedures needed to verify compliance.
              (b) When equipment or procedures, such as a field mill or calculation of the volume-averaged, height-integrated radar reflectivity (VAHIRR) of clouds, are used with the lightning flight commit criteria to increase launch opportunities, a launch operator must evaluate all applicable measurements to determine whether the measurements satisfy the criteria. A launch operator may not turn off available instrumentation to create the appearance of meeting a requirement and must use all radar reflectivity measurements within a specified volume for a VAHIRR calculation.
              (c) If a launch operator proposes any alternative lightning flight commit criteria, the launch operator must clearly and convincingly demonstrate that the alternative provides an equivalent level of safety to that required by this appendix.

              (c) A launch operator may initiate flight despite paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section if the thick cloud layer:
              (1) Is a cirriform cloud layer that has never been associated with convective clouds,
              (2) Is located entirely at altitudes where the temperature is colder than or equal to −15 degrees Celsius, and
              (3) Shows no evidence of containing liquid water.
              G417.19 Smoke Plumes
              (a) A launch operator may not initiate flight if the flight path will carry the launch vehicle through any non-transparent cumulus cloud that has developed from a smoke plume while the cloud is attached to the smoke plume, or for the first 60 minutes after the cumulus cloud is observed to be detached from the smoke plume.

              (b) This section does not apply to non-transparent cumulus clouds that have formed above a fire but have been detached from the smoke plume for more than 60 minutes. Section G417.7 applies.
              G417.21 Surface Electric Fields

              G417.25 Measurement of Cloud Radar Reflectivity, Computation of VAHIRR, and Measurement of Electric Field
              (a) Radar reflectivity measurement. A launch operator who measures radar reflectivity to comply with this appendix must employ a meteorological radar and ensure that—
              (1) The radar wavelength is greater than or equal to 5 cm;
              (2) A reflectivity measurement is due to a meteorological target;
              (3) The spatial accuracy and resolution of a reflectivity measurement is 1 kilometer or better;
              (4) Any attenuation caused by intervening precipitation or by an accumulation of water or ice on the radome is less than or equal to 1 dBZ; and
              (5) A reflectivity measurement contains no portion of the cone of silence above the radar antenna, nor any portion of any sector that is blocked out for payload safety reasons.
              (b) Computation of VAHIRR. A launch operator who measures VAHIRR to comply with this appendix must ensure that—
              (1) A digital signal processor provides radar reflectivity measurements on a three-dimensional Cartesian grid having a maximum grid-point-to-grid-point spacing of one kilometer in each of the three dimensions;
              (2) The specified volume is the volume bounded in the horizontal by vertical, plane, perpendicular sides located 5.5 kilometers (3 nautical miles) north, east, south, and west of the point where VAHIRR is to be evaluated; on the bottom by the 0 degree Celsius level; and on the top by an altitude of 20 kilometers;
              (3) Volume-averaged radar reflectivity is the arithmetic average of the radar reflectivity measurements in dBZ at grid points within the specified volume. A launch operator must include each grid point within the specified volume in the average if and only if that grid point has a radar reflectivity measurement equal to or greater than 0 dBZ. If fewer than 10% of the grid points in the specified volume have radar reflectivity measurements equal to or greater than 0 dBZ, then the volume-averaged radar reflectivity is either the maximum radar reflectivity measurement in the specified volume, or 0 dBZ, whichever is greater.
              (4) Average cloud thickness is the difference in kilometers or thousands of feet between an average top and an average base of all clouds in the specified volume, computed as follows:
              (i) The cloud base to be averaged is the higher, at each horizontal position, of either
              (A) The 0 degree Celsius altitude, or
              (B) The lowest altitude of all radar reflectivity measurements of 0 dBZ or greater.
              (ii) The cloud top to be averaged is the highest altitude of all radar reflectivity measurements of 0 dBZ or greater at each horizontal position.
              (iii) A launch operator must—
              (A) Take the cloud base at any horizontal position as the altitude of the corresponding base grid point minus half of the grid-point vertical separation;

              (B) Take the cloud top at that horizontal position as the altitude of the corresponding top grid point plus half of this vertical separation.
              (5) All VAHIRR-evaluation points in the flight path itself are:
              (i) Greater than a slant distance of 10 nautical miles from any radar reflectivity of 35 dBZ or greater at altitudes of 4 kilometers or greater above mean sea level; and
              (ii) Greater than a slant distance of 10 nautical miles from any type of lightning that has occurred in the previous 5 minutes.
              (iii) A launch operator need not apply paragraph (b)(5) of this section to VAHIRR evaluation points outside the flight path but within one nautical mile of the flight path.
              (6) VAHIRR is the product, expressed in units of dBZ-km or dBZ-kft, of the volume-averaged radar reflectivity defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and the average cloud thickness defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section in the specified volume defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (c) Electric field measurement. A launch operator who measures an electric field to comply with this appendix must—
              (1) Employ a ground-based field mill,
              (2) Use only the one-minute arithmetic average of the instantaneous readings from that field mill,
              (3) Ensure that all field mills are calibrated so that the polarity of the electric field measurements is the same as the polarity of a voltage placed on a test plate above the sensor,
              (4) Ensure that the altitude of the flight path of the launch vehicle is equal to or less than 20 kilometers (66 thousand feet) everywhere above a horizontal circle of 5 nautical miles centered on the field mill being used,
              (5) Use only direct measurements from a field mill, and
              (6) Not interpolate based on electric-field contours.

              Appendix I to Part 417—Methodologies for Toxic Release Hazard Analysis and Operational Procedures
              I417.1 General
              This appendix provides methodologies for performing toxic release hazard analysis for the flight of a launch vehicle as required by § 417.227 and for launch processing at a launch site in the United States as required by § 417.407(f). The requirements of this appendix apply to a launch operator and the launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis unless the launch operator clearly and convincingly demonstrates that an alternative approach provides an equivalent level of safety.
              I417.3 Identification of non-toxic and toxic propellants
              (a) General. A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis for launch vehicle flight (section I417.5) and for launch processing (section I417.7) must identify all propellants used for each launch and identify whether each propellant is toxic or non-toxic as required by this section.
              (b) Non-toxic exclusion. A launch operator need not conduct a toxic release hazard analysis under this appendix for flight or launch processing if its launch vehicle, including all launch vehicle components and payloads, uses only those propellants listed in Table I417-1.
              
                ER25AU06.099
              
              
              (c) Identification of toxic propellants. A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis for flight and for launch processing must identify all toxic propellants used for each launch, including all toxic propellants on all launch vehicle components and payloads. Table I417-2 lists commonly used toxic propellants and the associated toxic concentration thresholds used by the Federal launch ranges for controlling potential public exposure. The toxic concentration thresholds contained in Table I417-2 are peak exposure concentrations in parts per million (ppm). A launch operator must perform a toxic release hazard analysis to ensure that the public is not exposed to concentrations above the toxic concentration thresholds for each toxicant involved in a launch. A launch operator must use the toxic concentration thresholds contained in table I417-2 for those propellants. Any propellant not identified in table I417-1 or table I417-2 falls into the category of unique or uncommon propellants, such as those identified in table I417-3, which are toxic or produce toxic combustion by-products. Table I417.3 is not an exhaustive list of possible toxic propellants and combustion by-products. For a launch that uses any propellant listed in table I417-3 or any other unique propellant not listed, a launch operator must identify the chemical composition of the propellant and all combustion by-products and the release scenarios. A launch operator must determine the toxic concentration threshold in ppm for any uncommon toxic propellant or combustion by-product in accordance with the following:
              (1) For a toxicant that has a level of concern (LOC) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or Department of Transportation (DOT), a launch operator must use the LOC as the toxic concentration threshold for the toxic release hazard analysis except as required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (2) If an EPA acute emergency guidance level (AEGL) exists for a toxicant and is more conservative than the LOC (that is, lower after reduction for duration of exposure), a launch operator must use the AEGL instead of the LOC as the toxic concentration threshold.
              (3) A launch operator must use the EPA's Hazard Quotient/Hazard Index (HQ/HI) formulation to determine the toxic concentration threshold for mixtures of two or more toxicants.
              (4) If a launch operator must determine a toxic concentration threshold for a toxicant for which an LOC has not been established, the launch operator must clearly and convincingly demonstrate through the licensing process that public exposure at the proposed toxic concentration threshold will not cause a casualty.

              I417.5 Toxic release hazard analysis for launch vehicle flight
              (a) General. For each launch, a launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must determine all hazards to the public from any toxic release that will occur during the proposed flight of a launch vehicle or that would occur in the event of a flight mishap. A launch operator must use the results of the toxic release hazard analysis to establish for each launch, in accordance with § 417.113(c), flight commit criteria that protect the public from a casualty arising out of any potential toxic release. A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must determine if toxic release can occur based on an evaluation of the propellants, launch vehicle materials, and estimated combustion products. This evaluation must account for both normal combustion products and the chemical composition of any unreacted propellants.
              (b) Evaluating toxic hazards for launch vehicle flight. Each launch must satisfy either the exclusion requirements of section I417.3(b), the containment requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, or the statistical risk management requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, to prevent any casualty that could arise out of exposure to any toxic release.
              (c) Toxic containment for launch vehicle flight. For a launch that uses any toxic propellant, a launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must determine a hazard distance for each toxicant and a toxic hazard area for the launch. A hazard distance for a toxicant is the furthest distance from the launch point where toxic concentrations may be greater than the toxicant's toxic concentration threshold in the event of a release during flight. A launch operator must determine the toxic hazard distance for each toxicant as required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. A toxic hazard area defines the region on the Earth's surface that may be exposed to toxic concentrations greater than any toxic concentration threshold of any toxicant involved in a launch in the event of a release during flight. A launch operator must determine a toxic hazard area in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. In order to achieve containment, a launch operator must evacuate the public from a toxic hazard area as required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section or employ meteorological constraints as required by paragraph (c)(5) of this section. A launch operator must determine the hazard distance for a quantity of toxic propellant and determine and implement a toxic hazard area for a launch as follows:
              (1) Hazard distances for common propellants. Table I417-4 lists toxic hazard distances as a function of propellant quantity and toxic concentration threshold for commonly used propellants released from a catastrophic launch vehicle failure. Tables I417-10 and I417-11 list the hazard distance as a function of solid propellant mass for HC1 emissions during a launch vehicle failure and during normal flight for ammonium perchlorate based solid propellants. A launch operator must use the hazard distances corresponding to the toxic concentration thresholds established for a launch to determine the toxic hazard area for the launch in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
              (2) Hazard distances for uncommon or unique propellants. For a launch that involves any uncommon or unique propellant, a launch operator must determine the toxic hazard distance for each such propellant using an analysis methodology that accounts for the following worst case conditions:
              (i) Surface wind speed of 2.9 knots with a wind speed increase of 1.0 knot per 1000 feet of altitude.
              (ii) Surface temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit with a dry bulb temperature lapse rate of 13.7 degrees Fahrenheit per 1000 feet over the first 500 feet of altitude and a lapse rate of 3.0 degrees F per 1000 feet above 500 feet.
              (iii) Directional wind shear of 2 degrees per 1000 feet of altitude.
              (iv) Relative humidity of 50 percent.
              (v) Capping temperature inversion at the thermally stabilized exhaust cloud center of mass altitude.
              (vi) Worst case initial source term assuming instantaneous release of fully loaded propellant storage tanks or pressurized motor segments.
              (vii) Worst case combustion or mixing ratios such that production of toxic chemical species is maximized within the bounds of reasonable uncertainties.
              (viii) Evaluation of toxic hazards for both normal launch and vehicle abort failure modes.
              
                
                ER25AU06.103
              
              
                
                ER25AU06.104
              
              (3) Toxic hazard area. Having determined the toxic hazard distance for each toxicant, a launch operator must determine the toxic hazard area for a launch as a circle centered at the launch point with a radius equal to the greatest toxic hazard distance determined as required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, of all the toxicants involved in the launch. A launch operator does not have to satisfy paragraph (c)(3) of this section if:
              (i) The launch operator demonstrates that there are no populated areas contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area; and
              (ii) The launch operator ensures that no member of the public is present within the toxic hazard area during preflight fueling, launch countdown, flight and immediate postflight operations at the launch site. To ensure the absence of the public, a launch operator must develop flight commit criteria and related provisions for implementation as part of the launch operator's flight safety plan and hazard area surveillance and clearance plan developed under §§ 417.111(b) and 417.111(j), respectively.
              (4) Evacuation of populated areas within a toxic hazard area. For a launch where there is a populated area that is contained or partially contained within a toxic hazard area, the launch operator does not have to satisfy paragraph (c)(5) of this section if the launch operator evacuates all people from all populated areas at risk and ensures that no member of the public is present within the toxic hazard area during preflight fueling and flight. A launch operator must develop flight commit criteria and provisions for implementation of the evacuations as part of the launch operator's flight safety plan, hazard area surveillance and clearance plan, and local agreements and public coordination plan developed according to §§ 417.111(b), 417.111(j) and 417.111(i), respectively.
              (5) Flight meteorological constraints. For a launch where there is a populated area that is contained or partially contained within a toxic hazard area and that will not be evacuated under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the launch is exempt from any further requirements of this section if the launch operator constrains the flight of a launch vehicle to favorable wind conditions or during times when atmospheric conditions result in reduced toxic hazard distances such that any potentially affected populated area is outside the toxic hazard area. A launch operator must employ wind and other meteorological constraints as follows:
              
              (i) When employing wind constraints, a launch operator must re-define the toxic hazard area by reducing the circular toxic hazard area determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to one or more arc segments that do not contain any populated area. Each arc segment toxic hazard area must have the same radius as the circular toxic hazard area and must be defined by a range of downwind bearings.
              (ii) The launch operator must demonstrate that there are no populated areas within any arc segment toxic hazard area and that no member of the public is present within an arc segment toxic hazard area during preflight fueling, launch countdown, and immediate postflight operations at the launch site.
              (iii) A launch operator must establish wind constraints to ensure that any winds present at the time of flight will transport any toxicant into an arc segment toxic hazard area and away from any populated area. For each arc segment toxic hazard area, the wind constraints must consist of a range of downwind bearings that are within the arc segment toxic hazard area and that provide a safety buffer, in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions, that accounts for any uncertainty in the spatial and temporal variations of the transport winds. When determining the wind uncertainty, a launch operator must account for the variance of the mean wind directions derived from measurements of the winds through the first 6000 feet in altitude at the launch point. Each clockwise and counterclockwise safety buffer must be no less than 20 degrees of arc width within the arc segment toxic hazard area. A launch operator must ensure that the wind conditions at the time of flight satisfy the wind constraints. To accomplish this, a launch operator must monitor the launch site vertical profile of winds from the altitude of the launch point to no less than 6,000 feet above ground level. The launch operator must proceed with a launch only if all wind vectors within this vertical range satisfy the wind constraints. A launch operator must develop wind constraint flight commit criteria and implementation provisions as part of the launch operator's flight safety plan and its hazard area surveillance and clearance plan developed according to §§ 417.111(b) and 417.111(j), respectively.
              (iv) A launch operator may reduce the radius of the circular toxic hazard area determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section by imposing operational meteorological restrictions on specific parameters that mitigate potential toxic downwind concentrations levels at any potentially affected populated area to levels below the toxic concentration threshold of each toxicant in question. The launch operator must establish meteorological constraints to ensure that flight will be allowed to occur only if the specific meteorological conditions that would reduce the toxic hazard area exist and will continue to exist throughout the flight.
              (d) Statistical toxic risk management for flight. If a launch that involves the use of a toxic propellant does not satisfy the containment requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the launch operator must use statistical toxic risk management to protect public safety. For each such case, a launch operator must perform a toxic risk assessment and develop launch commit criteria that protect the public from unacceptable risk due to planned and potential toxic release. A launch operator must ensure that the resultant toxic risk meets the collective and individual risk criteria requirements contained in § 417.107(b). A launch operator's toxic risk assessment must account for the following:
              (1) All credible vehicle failure and non-failure modes, along with the consequent release and combustion of propellants and other vehicle combustible materials.
              (2) All vehicle failure rates.
              (3) The effect of positive or negative buoyancy on the rise or descent of each released toxicant.
              (4) The influence of atmospheric physics on the transport and diffusion of each toxicant.
              (5) Meteorological conditions at the time of launch.
              (6) Population density, location, susceptibility (health categories) and sheltering for all populations within each potential toxic hazard area.
              (7) Exposure duration and toxic propellant concentration or dosage that would result in casualty for all populations.
              (e) Flight toxic release hazard analysis products. The products of a launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis for launch vehicle flight to be filed in accordance with § 417.203(e) must include the following:
              (1) For each launch, a listing of all propellants used on all launch vehicle components and any payloads.
              (2) The chemical composition of each toxic propellant and all toxic combustion products.
              (3) The quantities of each toxic propellant and all toxic combustion products involved in the launch.
              (4) For each toxic propellant and combustion product, identification of the toxic concentration threshold used in the toxic risk analysis and a description of how the toxic concentration threshold was determined if other than specified in table I417.2.
              (5) When using the toxic containment approach of paragraph (c) of this section:
              (i) The hazard distance for each toxic propellant and combustion product and a description of how it was determined.

              (ii) A graphic depiction of the toxic hazard area or areas.
              
              (iii) A listing of any wind or other constraints on flight, and any plans for evacuation.
              (iv) A description of how the launch operator determines real-time wind direction in relation to the launch site and any populated area and any other meteorological condition in order to implement constraints on flight or to implement evacuation plans.
              (6) When using the statistical toxic risk management approach of paragraph (d) of this section:
              (i) A description of the launch operator's toxic risk management process, including an explanation of how the launch operator ensures that any toxic risk from launch meets the toxic risk criteria of § 417.107(b).
              (ii) A listing of all models used.
              (iii) A listing of all flight commit criteria that protect the public from unacceptable risk due to planned and potential toxic release.
              (iv) A description of how the launch operator measures and displays real-time meteorological conditions in order to determine whether conditions at the time of flight are within the envelope of those used by the launch operator for toxic risk assessment and to develop flight commit criteria, or for use in any real-time physics models used to ensure compliance with the toxic flight commit criteria.
              I417.7 Toxic release hazard analysis for launch processing
              (a) General. A launch operator must perform a toxic release hazard analysis to determine potential public hazards from toxic releases that will occur during normal launch processing and that will occur in the event of a mishap during launch processing. This section implements the ground safety requirements of § 417.407(g). A launch operator must use the results of the toxic release hazard analysis to establish hazard controls for protecting the public. A launch operator must include the toxic release hazard analysis results in the ground safety plan as required by § 417.111(c).
              (b) Process hazards analysis. A launch operator must perform an analysis on all processes to identify toxic hazards and determine the potential for release of a toxic propellant. The analysis must account for the complexity of the process and must identify and evaluate the hazards and each hazard control involved in the process. An analysis that complies with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) satisfies paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. A launch operator's process hazards analysis must include the following:
              (1) Identify and evaluate each hazard of a process involving a toxic propellant using an analysis method, such as a failure mode and effects analysis or fault tree analysis.
              (2) Describe:
              (i) Each toxic hazard associated with the process and the potential for release of toxic propellants;
              (ii) Each mishap or incident experienced which has a potential for catastrophic consequences;
              (iii) Each engineering and administrative control applicable to each hazard and their interrelationships, such as application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases and evacuation of toxic hazard areas prior to conducting an operation that involves a toxicant;
              (iv) Consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls;
              (v) Location of the source of the release;
              (vi) All human factors;
              (vii) Each opportunity for equipment malfunction or human error that can cause an accidental release;
              (viii) Each safeguard used or needed to control each hazard or prevent equipment malfunctions or human error;
              (ix) Each step or procedure needed to detect or monitor releases; and
              (x) A qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls.
              (3) The process hazards analysis must be updated for each launch. The launch operator must conduct a review of all the hazards associated with each process involving a toxic propellant for launch processing. The review must include inspection of equipment to determine whether the process is designed, fabricated, maintained, and operated according to the current process hazards analysis. A launch operator must revise a process hazards analysis to reflect changes in processes, types of toxic propellants stored or handled, or other aspects of a source of a potential toxic release that can affect the results of overall toxic release hazard analysis.
              (4) The personnel who perform a process hazard analysis must possess expertise in engineering and process operations, and at least one person must have experience and knowledge specific to the process being evaluated. At least one person must be knowledgeable in the specific process hazard analysis methodology being used.
              (5) A launch operator must resolve all recommendations resulting from a process hazards analysis in a timely manner prior to launch processing and the resolution must be documented. The documentation must identify each corrective action and include a written schedule of when any such actions are to be completed.
              (c) Evaluating toxic hazards of launch processing. A launch operator must protect the public from each potential toxic hazard identified by the process hazards analysis required by paragraph (b) of this section, the exclusion requirements of section I417.3(b), the containment requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, or the statistical risk management requirements of paragraph (l) of this section, to prevent any casualty that could arise out of exposure to any toxic release.
              (d) Toxic containment for launch processing. A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must determine a toxic hazard area surrounding the potential release site for each toxic propellant based on the amount and toxicity of the propellant and the meteorological conditions involved. A launch operator must determine whether there are populated areas located within a toxic hazard area that satisfy paragraph (h) of this section. If necessary to achieve toxic containment, a launch operator must evacuate the public in order to satisfy paragraph (i) of this section or employ meteorological constraints that satisfy paragraph (j) of this section. A launch operator, in determining a toxic hazard area, must first perform a worst-case release scenario analysis that satisfies paragraph (e) of this section or a worst-case alternative release scenario analysis that satisfies paragraph (f) of this section for each process that involves a toxic propellant. The launch operator must then determine a toxic hazard distance for each process that satisfies paragraph (g) of this section.
              (e) Worst-case release scenario analysis. A launch operator's worst-case release scenario analysis must account for the following:
              (1) Determination of worst-case release quantity. A launch operator must determine the worst-case release quantity of a toxic propellant by selecting the greater of the following:
              (i) For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a single vessel, accounting for administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity; or
              (ii) For toxic propellants in pipes, the greatest amount in a pipe, accounting for administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.
              (2) Worst-case release scenario for toxic liquids. A launch operator must determine the worst-case release scenario for a toxic liquid propellant as follows:
              (i) A launch operator must assume that for toxic propellants that are normally liquids at ambient temperature, the quantity in the vessel or pipe, as determined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool.
              (ii) The launch operator must determine surface area of the pool by assuming that the liquid spreads to one centimeter deep unless passive mitigation systems are in place that serve to contain the spill and limit the surface area. Where passive mitigation is in place, the launch operator must use the surface area of the contained liquid to calculate the volatilization rate.
              (iii) If the release occurs on a surface that is not paved or smooth, the launch operator may account for actual surface characteristics.
              (iv) The volatilization rate must account for the highest daily maximum temperature occurring in the past three years, the temperature of the substance in the vessel, and the concentration of the toxic propellants if the liquid spilled is a mixture or solution.

              (v) The launch operator must determine rate of release to the air from the volatilization rate of the liquid pool. A launch operator must use either the methodology provided in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, dated April 1999, available at http://www.epa.gov/swercepp/ap-ocgu.htm, or an air dispersion modeling technique that satisfies paragraph (g) of this section.
              (3) Worst-case release scenario for toxic gases. A launch operator must determine the worst-case release scenario for a toxic gas as follows:
              (i) For toxic propellants that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the launch operator must assume that the quantity in the vessel, or pipe, as determined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is released as a gas over 10 minutes. The launch operator must assume a release rate that is the total quantity divided by 10 unless passive mitigation systems are in place.
              (ii) For gases handled as refrigerated liquids at ambient pressure, if the released toxic propellant is not contained by passive mitigation systems or if the contained pool would have a depth of 1 cm or less, the launch operator must assume that the toxic propellant is released as a gas in 10 minutes.
              (iii) For gases handled as refrigerated liquids at ambient pressure, if the released toxic propellant is contained by passive mitigation systems in a pool with a depth greater than 1 cm, the launch operator must assume that the quantity in the vessel or pipe, as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool. The launch operator must calculate the volatilization rate at the boiling point of the toxic propellant and at the conditions defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
              (4) Consideration of passive mitigation. The launch operator must account for passive mitigation systems in the analysis of a worst case release scenario if the passive mitigation system is capable of withstanding the release event triggering the scenario and would function as intended.
              (5) Additional factors in selecting a worst-case scenario. A launch operator's worst-case release scenario for a toxic propellant must account for each factor that would result in a greater toxic hazard distance, such as a smaller quantity of the toxic propellant than required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, that is handled at a higher process temperature or pressure.
              (f) Worst-case alternative release scenario analysis. A launch operator's worst-case alternative release scenario analysis must account for the following:
              (1) The worst-case release scenario for each toxic propellant and for each toxic propellant handling process;
              (2) Each release event that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario that is determined in paragraph (e) of this section;
              (3) Each release scenario that exceeds a toxic concentration threshold at a distance that reaches the general public;
              (4) Each potential transfer hose release due to splits or sudden hose uncoupling;
              (5) Each potential process piping release from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves, valve seals, and drain bleeds;
              (6) Each potential process vessel or pump release due to cracks, seal failure, or drain, bleed, or plug failure;
              (7) Each vessel overfilling and spill, or over pressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks;
              (8) Shipping container mishandling and breakage or puncturing leading to a spill;
              (9) Mishandling or dropping flight or ground hardware that contains toxic commodities;
              (10) Each active and passive mitigation system provided they are capable of withstanding the event that triggered the release and would still be functional;
              (11) History of each accident experienced by the launch operator involving the release of a toxic propellant; and
              (12) Each failure scenario.
              (g) Toxic hazard distances for launch processing. For each process involving a toxic propellant, a launch operator must perform an air dispersion analysis to determine the hazard distance for the worst-case release scenario or the worst-case alternative release scenario as determined under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. A launch operator must use either the methodology provided in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, dated April 1999, or an air dispersion modeling technique that is applicable to the proposed launch. A launch operator's air dispersion modeling technique must account for the following analysis parameters:
              (1) Toxic concentration thresholds. A launch operator must use the toxic concentration thresholds defined by section I417.3(c).
              (2) Wind speed and atmospheric stability class. A launch operator, for the worst-case release analysis, must use a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and atmospheric stability class F. If the launch operator demonstrates that local meteorological data applicable to the source of a toxic release show a higher wind minimum wind speed or less stable atmosphere during the three previous years, the launch operator may use these minimums. The launch operator, for analysis of the worst-case alternative scenario, must use statistical meteorological conditions for the location of the source.
              (3) Ambient temperature and humidity. For a worst-case release scenario analysis of a toxic propellant, the launch operator must use the highest daily maximum temperature from the last three years and average humidity for the site, based on temperature and humidity data gathered at the source location or at a local meteorological station. For analysis of a worst-case alternative release scenario, the launch operator must use typical temperature and humidity data gathered at the source location or at a local meteorological station.
              (4) Height of release. The launch operator must analyze the worst-case release of a toxic propellant assuming a ground level release. For a worst-case alternative scenario analysis of a toxic propellant, the release scenario may determine release height.
              (5) Surface roughness. The launch operator must use either an urban or rural topography, as appropriate. Urban means that there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees. Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.
              (6) Dense or neutrally buoyant gases. Models or tables used for dispersion analysis of a toxic propellant must account for gas density.
              (7) Temperature of release substance. For a worst-case release scenario, the launch operator must account for the release of liquids other than gases liquefied by refrigeration at the highest daily maximum temperature, based on data for the previous three years appropriate to the source of the potential toxic release, or at process temperature, whichever is higher. For a worst-case alternative scenario, the launch operator may consider toxic propellants released at a process or ambient temperature that is appropriate for the scenario.
              (h) Toxic hazard areas for launch processing. A launch operator, having determined the toxic hazard distance for the toxic concentration threshold for each toxic propellant involved in a process using either a worst-case release scenario or a worst-case alternative release scenario, must determine the toxic hazard area for the process as a circle centered at the potential release point with a radius equal to the greatest toxic hazard distance for the toxic propellants involved in the process. A launch operator does not have to satisfy this section if:

              (1) There are no populated areas contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area; and
              
              (2) There is no member of the public present within the toxic hazard area during the process.
              (i) Evacuation of populated areas within a toxic hazard area. For a process where there is a populated area that is contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area, the launch processing operation does not have to satisfy this section if the launch operator evacuates the public from the populated area and ensures that no member of the public is present within the toxic hazard area during the operation. A launch operator must coordinate notification and evacuation procedures with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and ensure that notification and evacuation occurs according to its launch plans, including the launch operator's ground safety plan, hazard area surveillance and clearance plan, accident investigation plan, and local agreements and public coordination plan.
              (j) Meteorological constraints for launch processing. For a launch processing operation with the potential for a toxic release where there is a populated area that is contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area and that will not be evacuated as required by paragraph (i) of this section, the operation is exempt from further requirements in this section if the launch operator constrains the process to favorable wind conditions or during times when atmospheric conditions result in reduced toxic hazard distances such that the potentially affected populated area is outside the toxic hazard area. A launch operator must employ wind and other meteorological constraints that satisfy the following:
              (1) A launch operator must limit a launch processing operation to times during which prevailing winds will transport a toxic release away from populated areas that would otherwise be at risk. If the mean wind speed during the operation is equal to or greater than four knots, the launch operator must re-define the toxic hazard area by reducing the circular toxic hazard area as determined in paragraph (h) of this section to one or more arc segments that do not contain a populated area. Each arc segment toxic hazard area must have the same radius as the circular toxic hazard area and must be defined by a range of downwind bearings. If the mean wind speed during the operation is less than four knots, the toxic hazard area for the operation must be the full 360-degree toxic hazard area as defined by paragraph (h) of this section. The total arc width of an arc segment hazard area for launch processing must be greater than or equal to 30 degrees. If the launch operator determines the standard deviation of the measured wind direction, the total arc width of an arc segment hazard area must include all azimuths within the mean measured wind direction plus three sigma and the mean measured wind direction minus three sigma; otherwise, the following apply for the conditions defined by the Pasquil-Gifford meteorological stability classes:
              (i) For stable classes D-F, if the mean wind speed is less than 10 knots, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 90 degrees;
              (ii) For stable classes D-F, if the mean wind speed is greater than or equal to 10 knots, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 45 degrees;
              (iii) For neutral class C, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 60 degrees;
              (iv) For slightly unstable class B, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 105 degrees; and
              (v) For mostly unstable class A, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 150 degrees.
              (2) The launch operator must ensure that there are no populated areas within an arc segment toxic hazard area and that no member of the public is present within an arc segment toxic hazard area during the process as defined by paragraph (i) of this section.
              (3) A launch operator must establish wind constraints to ensure that winds present at the time of an operation will transport toxicants into an arc segment toxic hazard area and away from populated areas. For each arc segment toxic hazard area, the wind constraints must consist of a range of downwind bearings that are within the arc segment toxic hazard area and that provide a safety buffer, in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions, that accounts for uncertainty in the spatial and temporal variations of the transport winds.
              (4) A launch operator may reduce the radius of the circular toxic hazard area as determined under paragraph (h) of this section by imposing operational meteorological restrictions on specific parameters that mitigate potential toxic downwind concentrations levels at a potentially affected populated area to levels below the toxic concentration threshold of the toxicant in question. The launch operator must establish meteorological constraints to ensure that the operation will be allowed to occur only if the specific meteorological conditions that would reduce the toxic hazard area exist and will continue to exist throughout the operation, or the operation will be terminated.
              (k) Implementation of meteorological constraints. A launch operator must use one or more of the following approaches to determine wind direction or other meteorological conditions in order to establish constraints on a launch processing operation or evacuate the populated area in a potential toxic hazard area:
              
              (1) The launch operator must ensure that the wind conditions at the time of the process comply with the wind constraints used to define each arc segment toxic hazard area. The launch operator must monitor the vertical profile of winds at the potential toxic release site from ground level to an altitude of 10 meters or the maximum height above ground of the potential release, whichever is larger. The launch operator may proceed with a launch processing operation only if wind vectors meet the wind constraints used to define each arc segment toxic hazard area.
              (2) A launch operator must monitor the specific meteorological parameters that affect toxic downwind concentrations at a potential toxic release site for a process and for the sphere of influence out to each populated area within the potential toxic hazard area as defined by paragraph (h) of this section. The launch operator must monitor spatial variations in the wind field that could affect the transport of toxic material between the potential release site and populated areas. The launch operator must acquire real-time meteorological data from sites between the potential release site and each populated area sufficient to demonstrate that the toxic hazard area, when adjusted to the spatial wind field variations, excludes populated areas. Meteorological parameters that affect toxic downwind concentrations from the potential release site and covering the sphere of influence out to the populated areas must fall within the conditions as determined in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. A launch operator must use one of the following methods to determine the meteorological conditions that will constrain a launch processing operation:
              (i) A launch operator may employ real-time air dispersion models to determine the toxic hazard distance for the toxic concentration threshold and proximity of a toxicant to populated areas. A launch operator, when employing this method, must proceed with a launch processing operation only if real-time modeling of the potential release demonstrates that the toxic hazard distance would not reach populated areas. The launch operator's process for carrying out this method must include the use of an air dispersion modeling technique that complies with paragraph (g) of this section and providing real-time meteorological data for the sphere of influence around a potential toxic release site as input to the air dispersion model. The launch operator's process must also include a review of the meteorological conditions to identify changing conditions that could affect the toxic hazard distance for a toxic concentration threshold prior to proceeding with the operation.
              (ii) A launch operator may use air dispersion modeling techniques to define the meteorological conditions that, when present, would prevent a toxic hazard distance for a toxic concentration threshold from reaching populated areas. The launch operator, when employing this method, must constrain the associated launch processing operation to be conducted only when the prescribed meteorological conditions exist. A launch operator's air dispersion modeling technique must comply with paragraph (g) of this section.
              (l) Statistical toxic risk management for launch processing. The launch operator must use statistical toxic risk management to protect public safety if a process that involves the use of a toxic propellant does not satisfy the containment requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. A launch operator, for each such case, must perform a toxic risk assessment and develop criteria that protect the public from risks due to planned and potential toxic release. A launch operator must ensure that the resultant toxic risk meets the collective and individual risk criteria requirements defined in § 417.107(b). A launch operator's toxic risk assessment must account for the following:
              (1) All credible equipment failure and non-failure modes, along with the consequent release and combustion of toxic propellants;
              (2) Equipment failure rates;
              (3) The effect of positive or negative buoyancy on the rise or descent of the released toxic propellants;
              (4) The influence of atmospheric physics on the transport and diffusion of toxic propellants released;
              (5) Meteorological conditions at the time of the process;
              (6) Population density, location, susceptibility (health categories) and sheltering for populations within each potential toxic hazard area; and
              (7) Exposure duration and toxic propellant concentration or dosage that would result in casualty for populations.
              (m) Launch processing toxic release hazard analysis products. The products of a launch operator's toxic release hazards analysis for launch processing must include the following:
              (1) For each worst-case release scenario, a description of the vessel or pipeline and toxic propellant selected as the worst case for each process, assumptions and parameters used, and the rationale for selection of that scenario. Assumptions must include use of administrative controls and passive mitigation that were assumed to limit the quantity that could be released. The description must include the anticipated effect of the controls and mitigation on the release quantity and rate;

              (2) For each worst-case alternative release scenario, a description of the scenario identified for each process, assumptions and parameters used, and the rationale for the selection of that scenario. Assumptions must include use of administrative controls and passive mitigation that were assumed to limit the quantity that could be released. The description must include the anticipated effect of the controls and mitigation on the release quantity and rate;
              (3) Estimated quantity released, release rate, and duration of release for each worst-case scenario and worst-case alternative scenario for each process;
              (4) A description of the methodology used to determine the toxic hazard distance for each toxic concentration threshold;
              (5) Data used to estimate off-site population receptors potentially affected; and
              (6) The following data for each worst-case scenario and worst-case alternative release scenario:
              (i) Chemical name;
              (ii) Physical state;
              (iii) Basis of results (provide model name if used, or other methodology);
              (iv) Scenario (explosion, fire, toxic gas release, or liquid spill and vaporization);
              (v) Quantity released in pounds;
              (vi) Release rate;
              (vii) Release duration;
              (viii) Wind speed and atmospheric stability class;
              (ix) Topography;
              (x) Toxic hazard distance;
              (xi) All members of the public within the toxic hazard distance;
              (xii) Any passive mitigation considered; and
              (xiii) Active mitigation considered (worst-case alternative release scenario only).

A ground safety analysis report must include a chapter that provides detailed safety information about each launch vehicle system, subsystem and operation and each associated interface. The data in this chapter must include the following:
              (1) Introduction. A launch operator's ground safety analysis report must contain an introduction to its systems, subsystems, and operations information that serves as a roadmap and checklist to ensure all applicable items are covered. All flight and ground hardware must be identified with a reference to where the items are discussed in the document.

The introduction must identify interfaces between systems and operations and the boundaries that describe a system or operation.
              (2) Subsystem description. For each hardware system identified in a ground safety analysis report as falling under one of the hazardous systems listed in paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section, the report must identify each of the hardware system's subsystems. A ground safety analysis report must describe each hazardous subsystem using the following format:
              (i) General description including nomenclature, function, and a pictorial overview;
              (ii) Technical operating description including text and figures describing how a subsystem works and any safety features and fault tolerance levels;

              (iii) Each safety critical parameter, including those that demonstrate established system safety approaches that are not evident in the technical operating description or figures, such as factors of safety for structures and pressure vessels;
              
              (iv) Each major component, including any part of a subsystem that must be technically described in order to understand the subsystem hazards.

              (iv) Electrical and non-ionizing radiation systems; and
              (v) Ionizing radiation sources and systems.
              (4) Ground hardware. A ground safety analysis report must identify the launch operator's and launch site operator's ground hardware, including launch site and ground support equipment, that contains hazardous energy or materials, or that can affect flight hardware that contains hazardous energy or materials. A launch operator must identify all ground hardware by using the following sectional format:
              (i) Structural and mechanical ground support and checkout systems;
              (ii) Ordnance ground support and checkout systems;
              (iii) Propulsion and pressure ground support and checkout systems;

              (vii) Support and checkout systems and any other safety equipment used to monitor or control a potential hazard not otherwise addressed above.
              (5) Flight safety system. A ground safety analysis report must describe each hazard of inadvertent actuation of the launch operator's flight safety system, potential damage to the flight safety system during ground operations, and each hazard control that the launch operator will implement.
              (6) Hazardous materials. A ground safety analysis report must:
              (i) Identify each hazardous material used in all the launch operator's flight and ground systems, including the quantity and location of each material;
              (ii) Contain a summary of the launch operator's approach for protecting the public from toxic plumes, including the toxic concentration thresholds used to control public exposure and a description of any related local agreements;
              (iii) Describe any toxic plume model used to protect public safety and contain any algorithms used by the model; and
              (iv) Include the products of the launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis for launch processing as defined by section I417.7(m) of appendix I of this part for each launch that involves the use of any toxic propellants.
              (d) Hazard analysis. A ground safety analysis report must include a chapter containing a hazard analysis of the launch vehicle and launch vehicle processing and interfaces. The hazard analysis must identify each hazard and all hazard controls that the launch operator will implement. A ground safety analysis report must contain the results of the launch operator's hazard analysis of each system, subsystem, and operation using a standardized format that includes the items listed on the example hazard analysis form provided in figure J417-1 and that satisfies the following:
              (1) Introduction. A ground safety analysis report must contain an introduction that serves as a roadmap and checklist to the launch operator's hazard analysis forms. A launch operator must identify all flight hardware, ground hardware, interfacing hardware, and operations with a reference to where the items are discussed in the ground safety analysis report. The introduction must explain how a launch operator presents its hazard analysis in terms of hazard identification numbers as identified in figure J417-1.
              (2) Analysis. A launch operator may present each hazard on a separate form or consolidate hazards of a specific system, subsystem, component, or operation onto a single form. There must be at least one form for each hazardous subsystem and each hazardous subsystem operation. A launch operator must state which approach it has chosen in the introduction to the hazard analysis section. A launch operator must track each identified hazard control separately.
              (3) Numbering. A launch operator must number each hazard analysis form with the applicable system or subsystem identified. A launch operator must number each line item on a hazard analysis form with numbers and letters provided for multiple entries against an individual line item. A line item consists of a hardware or operation description and a hazard.
              (4) Hazard analysis data. A hazard analysis form must contain or reference all information necessary to understand the relationship of a system, subsystem, component, or operation with a hazard cause, control, and verification.
              (e) Hazard analysis supporting data. A ground safety analysis report must include data that supports the hazard analysis. If such data does not fit onto the hazard analysis form, a launch operator must provide the data in a supporting data chapter. This chapter must contain a table of contents and may reference other documents that contain supporting data.

              § 420.1
              General.
              (a) Scope. This part prescribes the information and demonstrations that must be provided to the FAA as part of a license application, the bases for license approval, license terms and conditions, and post-licensing requirements with which a licensee shall comply to remain licensed. Requirements for preparing a license application are contained in part 413 of this subchapter.
              (b) Equivalent level of safety. Each requirement of this part applies unless the applicant or licensee clearly and convincingly demonstrates that an alternative approach provides an equivalent level of safety to the requirement of this part.

              § 420.3
              Applicability.
              This part applies to any person seeking a license to operate a launch site or to a person licensed under this part. A person operating a site that only supports amateur rocket activities as defined in 14 CFR 1.1, does not need a license under this part to operate the site.

              § 420.65
              Separation distance requirements for handling division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives.
              (a) Quantity. For each explosive hazard facility, a launch site operator must determine the total quantity of division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives as follows:
              (1) A launch site operator must determine the maximum total quantity of division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives by class and division, in accordance with 49 CFR part 173, Subpart C, to be located in each explosive hazard facility where division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives will be handled.
              (2) When division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives are located in the same explosive hazard facility, the total quantity of explosive must be treated as division 1.1 for determining separation distances; or, a launch site operator may add the net explosive weight of the division 1.3 items to the net explosive weight of division 1.1 items to determine the total quantity of explosives.
              (b) Separation of division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives and determination of distances. A launch site operator must separate each explosive hazard facility where division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives are handled from all other explosive hazard facilities, all public traffic routes, and each public area, including the launch site boundary, by a distance no less than that provided for each quantity and explosive division in appendix E of this part as follows:
              (1) For division 1.1 explosives, the launch site operator must use tables E-1, E-2, and E-3 of appendix E of this part to determine the distance to each public area and public traffic route, and to determine each intraline distance.
              (2) For division 1.3 explosives, the launch site operator must use table E-4 of appendix E of this part to determine the distance to each public area and public traffic route, and to determine each intraline distance.
              (c) Separation distance by weight and table. A launch site operator must:
              (1) Employ no less than the public area distance, calculated under paragraph (b) of this section, to separate an explosive hazard facility from each public area, including the launch site boundary.
              (2) Employ no less than an intraline distance to separate an explosive hazard facility from all other explosive hazard facilities used by a single customer. For explosive hazard facilities used by different customers a launch site operator must use the greater public area distance to separate the facilities from each other.
              (3) Separate each public area containing any member of the public in the open by a distance equal to −1133.9 + [389 *ln(NEW)], where the NEW is greater than 450 pounds and less than 501,500 pounds.
              (d) NEW Quantities that Fall between Table Entries. A launch site operator must, when determining a separation distance for NEW quantities that fall between table entries, use the equation provided by tables E-1, E-3, or E-4 of appendix E of this part.
              (e) Calculating Maximum Permissible NEW Given a Distance. A launch site operator must, when determining a permissible quantity of explosives, calculate maximum permissible NEW using the equation of tables E-1, E-3, or E-4 of appendix E of this part.

              § 420.66
              Separation distance requirements for storage of hydrogen peroxide, hydrazine, and liquid hydrogen and any incompatible energetic liquids stored within an intraline distance.
              (a) Separation of energetic liquids and determination of distances. A launch site operator must separate each explosive hazard facility from each other explosive hazard facility, each public area, and each public traffic route in accordance with the minimum separation distance determined under this section for each explosive hazard facility storing:
              (1) Hydrogen peroxide in concentrations of greater than 91 percent;
              (2) Hydrazine;
              (3) Liquid hydrogen; or
              (4) Any energetic liquid that is:
              (i) Incompatible with any of the energetic liquids of paragraph (a)(1) through (3) of this section; and
              (ii) Stored within an intraline distance of any of them.
              (b) Quantity. For each explosive hazard facility, a launch site operator must determine the total quantity of all energetic liquids in paragraph (a)(1) through (4) of this section as follows:
              (1) The quantity of energetic liquid in a tank, drum, cylinder, or other container is the net weight in pounds of the energetic liquid in the container. The determination of quantity must include any energetic liquid in associated piping to any point where positive means exist for:
              (i) Interrupting the flow through the pipe, or
              (ii) Interrupting a reaction in the pipe in the event of a mishap.

              (2) A launch site operator must convert the quantity of each energetic liquid from gallons to pounds using the conversion factors provided in table E-6 of appendix E of this part and the following equation:
              
              Pounds of energetic liquid = gallons × density of energetic liquid (pounds per gallon).
              

              (3) Where two or more containers of compatible energetic liquids are stored in the same explosive hazard facility, the total quantity of energetic liquids is the total quantity of energetic liquids in all containers, unless:
              
              (i) The containers are each separated from each other by the distance required by paragraph (c) of this section; or
              (ii) The containers are subdivided by intervening barriers that prevent mixing, such as diking.
              (4) Where two or more containers of incompatible energetic liquids are stored within an intraline distance of each other, paragraph (d) of this section applies.
              (c) Determination of separation distances for compatible energetic liquids. A launch site operator must determine separation distances for compatible energetic liquids as follows:
              (1) To determine each intraline, public area, and public traffic route distance, a launch site operator must use the following tables in appendix E of this part:
              (i) Table E-7 for hydrogen peroxide in concentrations of greater than 91 percent; and
              (ii) Table E-8 for hydrazine and liquid hydrogen.
              (2) For liquid hydrogen and hydrazine, a launch site operator must use the “intraline distance to compatible energetic liquids” for the energetic liquid that requires the greater distance under table E-8 of appendix E of this part as the minimum separation distance between compatible energetic liquids.
              (d) Determination of separation distances for incompatible energetic liquids. If incompatible energetic liquids are stored within an intraline distance of each other, a launch site operator must determine the explosive equivalent in pounds of the combined liquids as provided by paragraph (d)(2) of this section unless intervening barriers prevent mixing.
              (1) If intervening barriers prevent mixing, a launch site operator must separate the incompatible energetic liquids by no less than the intraline distance that tables E-7 and E-8 of appendix E of this part apply to compatible energetic liquids using the quantity or energetic liquid requiring the greater separation distance.
              (2) A launch site operator must use the formulas provided in table E-5 of appendix E of this part, to determine the explosive equivalent in pounds of the combined incompatible energetic liquids. A launch site operator must then use the explosive equivalent in pounds requiring the greatest separation distance to determine the minimum separation distance between each explosive hazard facility and all other explosive hazard facilities and each public area and public traffic route as required by tables E-1, E-2 and E-3 of appendix E of this part.

              Separation distance requirements for handling incompatible energetic liquids that are co-located.
              (a) Separation of energetic liquids and determination of distances. Where incompatible energetic liquids are co-located in a launch or reentry vehicle tank or other vessel, a launch site operator must separate each explosive hazard facility from each other explosive hazard facility, each public area, and each public traffic route in accordance with the minimum separation distance determined under this section for each explosive hazard facility.
              (b) Quantity. For each explosive hazard facility, a launch site operator must determine the total quantity of all energetic liquids as follows:
              (1) The quantity of energetic liquid in a launch or reentry vehicle tank is the net weight in pounds of the energetic liquid. The determination of quantity must include any energetic liquid in associated piping to any point where positive means exist for:
              (i) Interrupting the flow through the pipe; or
              (ii) Interrupting a reaction in the pipe in the event of a mishap.

              (2) A launch site operator must convert each energetic liquid's quantity from gallons to pounds using the conversion factors provided by table E-6 of appendix E of this part and the following equation:
              
              Pounds of energetic liquid = gallons × density of energetic liquid (pounds per gallon).
              
              (c) Determination of separation distances for incompatible energetic liquids. A launch site operator must determine separation distances for incompatible energetic liquids as follows:
              
              (1) A launch site operator must use the formulas provided in table E-5 of appendix E of this part, to determine the explosive equivalent in pounds of the combined incompatible energetic liquids; and
              (2) A launch site operator must then use the explosive equivalent in pounds to determine the minimum separation distance between each explosive hazard facility and all other explosive hazard facilities and each public area and public traffic route as required by tables E-1, E-2 and E-3 of appendix E of this part. Where two explosive hazard facilities contain different quantities, the launch site operator must use the quantity of liquid propellant requiring the greatest separation distance to determine the minimum separation distance between the two explosive hazard facilities.
              (d) Separation distance by weight and table. For each explosive hazard facility, a launch site operator must:
              (1) For an explosive equivalent weight from one pound through and including 450 pounds, determine the distance to any public area and public traffic route following table E-1 of appendix E of this part;
              (2) For explosive equivalent weight greater than 450 pounds, determine the distance to any public area and public traffic route following table E-2 of appendix E of this part;
              (3) Separate each public area containing any member of the public in the open by a distance equal to −1133.9 + [389 *ln(NEW)], where the NEW is greater than 450 pounds and less than 501,500 pounds;

              (e) Use of maximum credible event analysis. If a launch site operator does not want to employ paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section, the launch site operator must analyze the maximum credible event (MCE) or the worst case explosion expected to occur. If the MCE shows there will be no simultaneous explosion reaction of the liquid propellant tanks and the solid propellant motors, the minimum distance between the explosive hazard facility and all other explosive hazard facilities and public areas must be based on the MCE.

              (1) Elements of a lighting protection system. Unless an explosive hazard facility meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, all explosive hazard facilities shall have a lightning protection system to ensure explosives are not initiated by lightning. A lightning protection system shall meet the requirements of this paragraph and include the following:
              (i) Air terminal. An air terminal to intentionally attract a lightning strike.
              (ii) Down conductor. A low impedance path connecting an air terminal to an earth electrode system.
              (iii) Earth electrode system. An earth electrode system to dissipate the current from a lightning strike to ground.
              (2) Bonding and surge protection. A lightning protection system must meet the requirements of this paragraph and include the following:
              (i) Bonding. All metallic bodies shall be bonded to ensure that voltage potentials due to lightning are equal everywhere in the explosive hazard facility. Any fence within six feet of a lightning protection system shall have a bond across each gate and other discontinuations and shall be bonded to the lightning protection system. Railroad tracks that run within six feet of the lightning protection system shall be bonded to the lightning protection system.
              (ii) Surge protection. A lightning protection system shall include surge protection to reduce transient voltages due to lightning to a harmless level for all metallic power, communication, and instrumentation lines entering an explosive hazard facility.
              (3) Circumstances where no lightning protection system is required. No lightning protection system is required for an explosive hazard facility when a lightning warning system is available to permit termination of operations and withdrawal of the public to public area distance prior to an electrical storm, or for an explosive hazard facility containing explosives that cannot be initiated by lightning. If no lightning protection system is required, a licensee must ensure the withdrawal of the public to a public area distance prior to an electrical storm.
              (4) Testing and inspection. Lightning protection systems shall be visually inspected semiannually and shall be tested once each year for electrical continuity and adequacy of grounding. A licensee shall maintain at the explosive hazard facility a record of results obtained from the tests, including any action taken to correct deficiencies noted.
              (b) Electrical power lines. A licensee shall ensure that electric power lines at its launch site meet the following requirements:
              (1) Electric power lines shall be no closer to an explosive hazard facility than the length of the lines between the poles or towers that support the lines unless an effective means is provided to ensure that energized lines cannot, on breaking, come in contact with the explosive hazard facility.
              (2) Towers or poles supporting electrical distribution lines that carry between 15 and 69 KV, and unmanned electrical substations shall be no closer to an explosive hazard facility than the public area distance for that explosive hazard facility.
              (3) Towers or poles supporting electrical transmission lines that carry 69 KV or more, shall be no closer to an explosive hazard facility than the public area distance for that explosive hazard facility.

              Appendix A to Part 420—Method for Defining a Flight Corridor
              (a) Introduction
              (1) This appendix provides a method for constructing a flight corridor from a launch point for a guided suborbital launch vehicle or any one of the four classes of guided orbital launch vehicles from table 1, § 420.19, without the use of local meteorological data or a launch vehicle trajectory.

              (2) A flight corridor includes an overflight exclusion zone in a launch area and, for a guided suborbital launch vehicle, an impact dispersion area in a downrange area. A flight corridor for a guided suborbital launch vehicle ends with the impact dispersion area, and, for the four classes of guided orbital launch vehicles, 5000 nautical miles (nm) from the launch point.
              (b) Data requirements
              (1) Maps. An applicant shall use any map for the launch site region with a scale not less than 1:250,000 inches per inch in the launch area and 1:20,000,000 inches per inch in the downrange area. As described in paragraph (b)(2), an applicant shall use a mechanical method, a semi-automated method, or a fully-automated method to plot a flight corridor on maps. A source for paper maps acceptable to the FAA is the U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Ocean Service.
              (i) Projections for mechanical plotting method. An applicant shall use a conic projection. The FAA will accept a “Lambert-Conformal” conic projection. A polar aspect of a plane-azimuthal projection may also be used for far northern launch sites.
              (ii) Projections for semi-automated plotting method. An applicant shall use cylindrical, conic, or plane projections for semi-automated plotting. The FAA will accept “Mercator” and “Oblique Mercator” cylindrical projections. The FAA will accept “Lambert-Conformal” and “Albers Equal-Area” conic projections. The FAA will accept “Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area” and “Azimuthal Equidistant” plane projections.
              (iii) Projections for fully-automated plotting method. The FAA will accept map projections used by geographical information system software scaleable pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b)(1).
              (2) Plotting Methods.
              (i) Mechanical method. An applicant may use mechanical drafting equipment such as pencil, straight edge, ruler, protractor, and compass to plot the location of a flight corridor on a map. The FAA will accept straight lines for distances less than or equal to 7.5 times the map scale on map scales greater than or equal to 1:1,000,000 inches per inch (in/in); or straight lines representing 100 nm or less on map scales less than 1:1,000,000 in/in.
              (ii) Semi-automated method. An applicant may employ the range and bearing techniques in paragraph (b)(3) to create latitude and longitude points on a map. The FAA will accept straight lines for distances less than or equal to 7.5 times the map scale on map scales greater than or equal to 1:1,000,000 inches per inch (in/in); or straight lines representing 100 nm or less on map scales less than 1:1,000,000 in/in.
              (iii) Fully-automated method. An applicant may use geographical information system software with global mapping data scaleable in accordance with paragraph (b)(1).
              (3) Range and bearing computations on an ellipsoidal Earth model.
              (i) To create latitude and longitude pairs on an ellipsoidal Earth model, an applicant shall use the following equations to calculate geodetic latitude (+N) and longitude (+E) given the launch point geodetic latitude (+N), longitude (+E), range (nm), and bearing (degrees, positive clockwise from North).
              (A) Input. An applicant shall use the following input in making range and bearing computations. Angle units must be in radians.

              (c) Creation of a Flight Corridor
              (1) To define a flight corridor, an applicant shall:
              (i) Select a guided suborbital or orbital launch vehicle, and, for an orbital launch vehicle, select from table 1 of § 420.19 a launch vehicle weight class that best represents the launch vehicle the applicant plans to support at its launch point;
              (ii) Select a debris dispersion radius (Dmax) from table A-1 corresponding to the guided suborbital launch vehicle or orbital launch vehicle class selected in paragraph (c)(1)(i);
              (iii) Select a launch point geodetic latitude and longitude; and
              (iv) Select a flight azimuth.
              (2) An applicant shall define and map an overflight exclusion zone using the following method:
              (i) Select a debris dispersion radius (Dmax) from table A-1 and a downrange distance (DOEZ) from table A-2 to define an overflight exclusion zone for the guided suborbital launch vehicle or orbital launch vehicle class selected in paragraph (c)(1)(i).
              (ii) An overflight exclusion zone is described by the intersection of the following boundaries, which are depicted in figure A-1:

              (A) An applicant shall define an uprange boundary with a half-circle arc of radius Dmax and a chord of length twice Dmax connecting the half-circle arc endpoints. The uprange boundary placement on a map has the chord midpoint positioned on the launch point with the chord oriented along an azimuth ±90°from the launch azimuth and the half-circle arc located uprange from the launch point.

              (B) An applicant shall define the downrange boundary with a half-circle arc of radius Dmax and a chord of length twice Dmax connecting the half-circle arc endpoints. The downrange boundary placement on a map has the chord midpoint intersecting the nominal flight azimuth line at a distance DOEZ inches downrange with the chord oriented along an azimuth ±90°from the launch azimuth and the half-circle arc located downrange from the intersection of the chord and the flight azimuth line.
              (C) Crossrange boundaries of an overflight exclusion zone are defined by two lines segments. Each is parallel to the flight azimuth with one to the left side and one to the right side of the flight azimuth line. Each line connects an uprange half-circle arc endpoint to a downrange half-circle arc endpoint as shown in figure A-1.
              (iii) An applicant shall identify the overflight exclusion zone on a map that meets the requirements of paragraph (b).
              (3) An applicant shall define and map a flight corridor using the following method:

              (i) In accordance with paragraph (b), an applicant shall draw a flight corridor on one or more maps with the Dmax origin centered on the intended launch point and the flight corridor centerline (in the downrange direction) aligned with the initial flight azimuth. The flight corridor is depicted in figure A-2 and its line segment lengths are tabulated in table A-3.

              (ii) An applicant shall define the flight corridor using the following boundary definitions:
              

              (A) An applicant shall draw an uprange boundary, which is defined by an arc-line GB (figure A-2), directly uprange from and centered on the intended launch point with radius Dmax.
              (B) An applicant shall draw line CF perpendicular to and centered on the flight azimuth line, and positioned 10 nm downrange from the launch point. The applicant shall use the length of line CF provided in table A-3 corresponding to the guided suborbital launch vehicle or orbital launch vehicle class selected in paragraph (c)(1)(i).
              (C) An applicant shall draw line DE perpendicular to and centered on the flight azimuth line, and positioned 100 nm downrange from the launch point. The applicant shall use the length of line DE provided in table A-3 corresponding to the guided suborbital launch vehicle or orbital launch vehicle class selected in paragraph (c)(1)(i).
              (D) Except for a guided suborbital launch vehicle, an applicant shall draw a downrange boundary, which is defined by line HI and is drawn perpendicular to and centered on the flight azimuth line, and positioned 5,000 nm downrange from the launch point. The applicant shall use the length of line HI provided in table A-3 corresponding to the orbital launch vehicle class selected in paragraph (c)(1)(i).
              (E) An applicant shall draw crossrange boundaries, which are defined by three lines on the left side and three lines on the right side of the flight azimuth. An applicant shall construct the left flight corridor boundary according to the following, and as depicted in figure A-3 :
              (1) The first line (line BC in figure A-3) is tangent to the uprange boundary arc, and ends at endpoint C of line CF, as depicted in figure A-3;
              (2) The second line (line CD in figure A-3) begins at endpoint C of line BC and ends at endpoint D of line DH, as depicted in figure A-3;
              (3) For all orbital launch vehicles, the third line (line DH in figure A-3) begins at endpoint D of line CD and ends at endpoint H of line HI, as depicted in figure A-3; and
              (4) For a guided suborbital launch vehicle, the line DH begins at endpoint D of line CD and ends at a point tangent to the impact dispersion area drawn in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) and as depicted in figure A-4.
              (F) An applicant shall repeat the procedure in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) for the right side boundary.
              (iii) An applicant shall identify the flight corridor on a map that meets the requirements of paragraph (b).
              (4) For a guided suborbital launch vehicle, an applicant shall define a final stage impact dispersion area as part of the flight corridor and show the impact dispersion area on a map, as depicted in figure A-4, in accordance with the following:
              (i) An applicant shall select an apogee altitude (Hap) for the launch vehicle final stage. The apogee altitude should equal the highest altitude intended to be reached by a guided suborbital launch vehicle launched from the launch point.

              (ii) An applicant shall define the impact dispersion area by using an impact range factor [IP(Hap)] and a dispersion factor [DISP(Hap)] as shown below:

              (A) An applicant shall calculate the impact range (D) for the final launch vehicle stage. An applicant shall set D equal to the maximum apogee altitude (Hap) multiplied by the impact range factor as shown below:
              
                ER19OC00.048
              
              where: IP(Hap) = 0.4 for an apogee less than 100 km; and IP(Hap) = 0.7 for an apogee 100 km or greater.
              

              (B) An applicant shall calculate the impact dispersion radius (R) for the final launch vehicle stage. An applicant shall set R equal to the maximum apogee altitude (Hap) multiplied by the dispersion factor as shown below:
              
                ER19OC00.049
              
              where: DISP(Hap) = 0.05
              
              (iii) An applicant shall draw the impact dispersion area on a map with its center on the predicted impact point. An applicant shall then draw line DH in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(4).
              (d) Evaluate the Flight Corridor
              (1) An applicant shall evaluate the flight corridor for the presence of any populated areas. If an applicant determines that no populated area is located within the flight corridor, then no additional steps are necessary.
              (2) If a populated area is located in an overflight exclusion zone, an applicant may modify its proposal or demonstrate that there are times when no people are present or that the applicant has an agreement in place to evacuate the public from the overflight exclusion zone during a launch.

              (3) If a populated area is located within the flight corridor, an applicant may modify its proposal and create another flight corridor pursuant to appendix A, use appendix B to narrow the flight corridor, or complete a risk analysis in accordance with appendix C.

              Appendix B to Part 420—Method for Defining a Flight Corridor
              (a) Introduction
              (1) This appendix provides a method to construct a flight corridor from a launch point for a guided suborbital launch vehicle or any one of the four weight classes of guided orbital launch vehicles from table 1, § 420.19, using local meteorological data and a launch vehicle trajectory.
              (2) A flight corridor is constructed in two sections—one section comprising a launch area and one section comprising a downrange area. The launch area of a flight corridor reflects the extent of launch vehicle debris impacts in the event of a launch vehicle failure and applying local meteorological conditions. The downrange area reflects the extent of launch vehicle debris impacts in the event of a launch vehicle failure and applying vehicle imparted velocity, malfunctions turns, and vehicle guidance and performance dispersions.
              (3) A flight corridor includes an overflight exclusion zone in the launch area and, for a guided suborbital launch vehicle, an impact dispersion area in the downrange area. A flight corridor for a guided suborbital launch vehicle ends with an impact dispersion area and, for the four classes of guided orbital launch vehicles, 5,000 nautical miles (nm) from the launch point, or where the IIP leaves the surface of the Earth, whichever is shorter.
              (b) Data Requirements

The locus of IIPs describes the boundary of the downrange area of a flight corridor. An applicant shall use the following subparagraphs, (d)(3)(i)-(v), to compute the downrange area of the flight corridor boundary:
              (i) Compute the downrange Distance to the final IIP position for a nominal trajectory as follows:

              (C) The distance for Smax may not exceed 5000 nm. In cases when the actual value exceeds 5000 nm the applicant shall use 5000 nm for Smax.

The IIP computations will result in latitude and longitude pairs for the left-lateral flight corridor boundary and the right-lateral flight corridor boundary. An applicant shall use the lines connecting the latitude and longitude pairs to describe the entire downrange area boundary of the flight corridor up to 5000 nm or a final stage impact dispersion area.

              (A) An applicant shall approximate the radial distance (rk,l) from the geocenter to the IIP. The distance from the center of the Earth ellipsoid to the launch point shall be used for the initial approximation of rk,l as shown in equation B46.

              Appendix C to Part 420—Risk Analysis
              (a) Introduction

              (1) This appendix provides a method for an applicant to estimate the expected casualty (Ec) for a launch of a guided expendable launch vehicle using a flight corridor generated either by appendix A or appendix B. This appendix also provides an applicant options to simplify the method where population at risk is minimal.

              (2) An applicant shall perform a risk analysis when a populated area is located within a flight corridor defined by either appendix A or appendix B. If the estimated expected casualty exceeds 1 × 10−4, an applicant may either modify its proposal, or if the flight corridor used was generated by the appendix A method, use the appendix B method to narrow the flight corridor and then redo the overflight risk analysis pursuant to this appendix. If the estimated expected casualty still exceeds 1 × 10−4, the FAA will not approve the location of the proposed launch point.
              (b) Data Requirements
              (1) An applicant shall obtain the data specified by subparagraphs (b)(2) and (3) and summarized in table C-1. Table C-1 provides sources where an applicant may obtain data acceptable to the FAA. An applicant must also employ the flight corridor information from appendix A or B, including flight azimuth and, for an appendix B flight corridor, trajectory information.
              (2) Population data. Total population (N) and the total landmass area within a populated area (A) are required. Population data up to and including 100 nm from the launch point are required at the U.S. census block group level. Population data downrange from 100 nm are required at no greater than 1° × 1° latitude/longitude grid coordinates.

              (3) Launch vehicle data. Launch vehicle data consist of the launch vehicle failure probability (Pf), the launch vehicle effective casualty area (Ac), trajectory position data, and the overflight dwell time (td). The failure probability is a constant (Pf = 0.10) for a guided orbital or suborbital expendable launch vehicle. Table C-3 provides effective casualty area data based on IIP range. Trajectory position information is provided from distance computations provided by this appendix for an appendix A flight corridor, or trajectory data used in appendix B for an appendix B flight corridor. The dwell time (td) may be determined from trajectory data produced when creating an appendix B flight corridor.

              (c) Estimating Corridor Casualty Expectation
              (1) A corridor casualty expectation [EC(Corridor)] estimate is the sum of the expected casualty measurement of each populated area inside a flight corridor.
              (2) An applicant shall identify and locate each populated area in the proposed flight corridor.

              (3) An applicant shall determine the probability of impact in each populated area using the procedures in subparagraphs (5) or (6) of this paragraph. Figures C-1 and C-2 illustrate an area considered for probability of impact (Pi) computations by the dashed-lined box around the populated area within a flight corridor, and figure C-3 illustrates a populated area in a final stage impact dispersion area. An applicant shall then estimate the EC for each populated area in accordance with subparagraphs (7) and (8) of this paragraph.
              (4) The Pi computations do not directly account for populated areas whose areas are bisected by an appendix A flight corridor centerline or an appendix B nominal trajectory ground trace. Accordingly, an applicant must evaluate Pi for each of the bi-sections as two separate populated areas, as shown in figure C-4, which shows one bi-section to the left of an appendix A flight corridor's centerline and one to its right.
              (5) Probability of impact (Pi) computations for a populated area in an appendix A flight corridor. An applicant shall compute Pi for each populated area using the following method:

              (i) For the launch and downrange areas, but not for a final stage impact dispersion area for a guided suborbital launch vehicle, an applicant shall compute Pi for each populated area using the following equation:

              (ii) For each populated area within a final stage impact dispersion area, an applicant shall compute Pi using the following method:
              (A) An applicant shall estimate the probability of final stage impact in the x and y sectors of each populated area within the final stage impact dispersion area using equations C2 and C3:
              
                ER19oc00.095
              
              where:
              
              X1, X2 = closest and farthest downrange distance, measured along the flight corridor centerline, measured from the nominal impact point to the populated area (see figure C-3)
              σx = one-third of the impact dispersion radius (see figure C-3)
              exp = exponential function (e x)
              
                ER19oc00.096
              
              where:
              
              y1, y2 = closest and farthest cross range distance to the populated area measured from the flight corridor centerline (see figure C-3)
              σy = one-third of the impact dispersion radius (see figure C-3)
              exp = exponential function (e x)
              

              (B) If a populated area intersects the impact dispersion area boundary so that the x2 or y2 distance would otherwise extend outside the impact dispersion area, the x2 or y2 distance should be set equal to the impact dispersion area radius. The x2 distance for populated area A in figure C-3 is an example. If a populated area intersects the flight azimuth, an applicant shall solve equation C3 by obtaining the solution in two parts. An applicant shall determine, first, the probability between y1 = 0 and y2 = a and, second, the probability between y1 = 0 and y2 = b, as depicted in figure C-4. The probability Py is then equal to the sum of the probabilities of the two parts. If a populated area intersects the line that is normal to the flight azimuth on the impact point, an applicant shall solve equation C2 by obtaining the solution in two parts in the same manner as with the values of x.
              (C) An applicant shall calculate the probability of impact for each populated area using equation C4 below:
              
                ER19oc00.097

              (6) Probability of impact computations for a populated area in an appendix B flight corridor. An applicant shall compute Pi using the following method:

              (i) For the launch and downrange areas, but not for a final stage impact dispersion area for a guided suborbital launch vehicle, an applicant shall compute Pi for each populated area using the following equation:
              
                ER19OC00.099
              
              where:
              
              y1,y2 = closest and farthest cross range distance (nm) to a populated area measured from the nominal trajectory IIP ground trace (see figure C-2)
              σy = one-third of the cross range distance (nm) from nominal trajectory to the flight corridor boundary (see figure C-2)
              exp = exponential function (ex)
              Pf = probability of failure = 0.10
              t = flight time from lift-off to orbital insertion (seconds)
              td = overflight dwell time (seconds)
              

              (ii) For each populated area within a final stage impact dispersion area, an applicant shall compute Pi using the following method:
              (A) An applicant shall estimate the probability of final stage impact in the x and y sectors of each populated area within the final stage impact dispersion area using equations C6 and C7:
              
                
                ER19OC00.100
              
              where:
              
              x1, x2 = closest and farthest downrange distance, measured along nominal trajectory IIP ground trace, measured from the nominal impact point to the populated area (see figure C-3)
              σx = one-third of the impact dispersion radius (see figure C-3)
              exp = exponential function (ex)
              
                ER19OC00.105
              
              where:
              
              y1, y2 = closest and farthest cross range distance to the populated area measured from the nominal trajectory IIP ground trace (see figure C-3)
              σy = one-third of the impact dispersion radius (see figure C-3)
              exp = exponential function (ex)
              

              (B) If a populated area intersects the impact dispersion area boundary so that the x2 or y2 distance would otherwise extend outside the impact dispersion area, the x2 or y2 distance should be set equal to the impact dispersion area radius. The x2 distance for populated area A in figure C-3 is an example. If a populated area intersects the flight azimuth, an applicant shall solve equation C7 by obtaining the solution in two parts. An applicant shall determine, first, the probability between y1 = 0 and y2 = a and, second, the probability between y1 = 0 and y2 = b, as depicted in figure C-4. The probability Py is then equal to the sum of the probabilities of the two parts. If a populated area intersects the line that is normal to the flight azimuth on the impact point, an applicant shall solve equation C6 by obtaining the solution in two parts in a similar manner with the values of x.
              (C) An applicant shall calculate the probability of impact for each populated area using equation C8 below:
              
                ER19OC00.106
              
              where: Ps = 1−Pf = 0.90
              
              
                
                ER19OC00.107
              
              
                
                ER19OC00.108
              
              (7) Using the Pi calculated in either subparagraph (c)(5) or (6) of this paragraph, an applicant shall calculate the casualty expectancy for each populated area within the flight corridor in accordance with equation C9. Eck is the casualty expectancy for a given populated area as shown in equation C9, where individual populated areas are designated with the subscript “k”.
              
                ER19OC00.109
              
              where:
              
              
              Ac = casualty area (from table C-3)
              Ak = populated area

              (9) Alternative casualty expectancy (EC) analyses. An applicant may employ specified variations to the analysis defined by subparagraphs (c)(1)-(8). Those variations are identified in subparagraphs (9)(i) through (vi) of this paragraph. Subparagraphs (i) through (iv) permit an applicant to make conservative assumptions that would lead to an overestimation of the corridor EC compared with the analysis defined by subparagraphs (c)(1)-(8). In subparagraphs (v) and (vi), an applicant that would otherwise fail the analysis prescribed by subparagraphs (c)(1)-(8) may avoid (c)(1)-(8)'s overestimation of the probability of impact in each populated area. An applicant employing a variation shall identify the variation used, show and discuss the specific assumptions made to modify the analysis defined by subparagraphs (c)(1)-(8), and demonstrate how each assumption leads to overestimation of the corridor EC compared with the analysis defined by subparagraphs (c)(1)-(c)(8).
              (i) Assume that Px and Py have a value of 1.0 for all populated areas.
              (ii) Combine populated areas into one or more larger populated areas, and use a population density for the combined area or areas equal to the most densely populated area.
              (iii) For any given populated area, assume Py has a value of one.
              (iv) For any given Px sector (an area spanning the width of a flight corridor and bounded by two time points on the trajectory IIP ground trace) assume Py has a value of one and use a population density for the sector equal to the most densely populated area.

              (v) For a given populated area, divide the populated area into smaller rectangles, determine Pi for each individual rectangle, and sum the individual impact probabilities to determine Pi for the entire populated area.

              (vi) For a given populated area, use the ratio of the populated area to the area of the Pi rectangle from the subparagraph (c)(1)-(8) analysis.
              (d) Evaluation of Results

              (1) If the estimated expected casualty does not exceed 1 × 10−4, the FAA will approve the launch site location.
              (2) If the estimated expected casualty exceeds 1 × 10−4, then an applicant may either modify its proposal, or, if the flight corridor used was generated by the appendix A method, use the appendix B method to narrow the flight corridor and then perform another appendix C risk analysis.

              Appendix D to Part 420—Impact Dispersion Areas and Casualty Expectancy Estimate for an Unguided Suborbital Launch Vehicle
              (a) Introduction

              (1) This appendix provides a method for determining the acceptability of the location of a launch point from which an unguided suborbital launch vehicle would be launched. The appendix describes how to define an overflight exclusion zone and impact dispersion areas, and how to evaluate whether the public risk presented by the launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle remains at acceptable levels.
              (2) An applicant shall base its analysis on an unguided suborbital launch vehicle whose final launch vehicle stage apogee represents the intended use of the launch point.
              (3) An applicant shall use the apogee of each stage of an existing unguided suborbital launch vehicle with a final launch vehicle stage apogee equal to the one proposed, and calculate each impact range and dispersion area using the equations provided.

              (4) This appendix also provides a method for performing an impact risk analysis that estimates the expected casualty (Ec) within each impact dispersion area. This appendix provides an applicant options to simplify the method where population at risk is minimal.
              (5) If the estimated Ec is less than or equal to 1 × 10−4, the FAA will approve the launch point for unguided suborbital launch vehicles. If the estimated Ec exceeds 1 × 10−4, the proposed launch point will fail the launch site location review.
              (b) Data Requirements
              (1) An applicant shall employ the apogee of each stage of an existing unguided suborbital launch vehicle whose final stage apogee represents the maximum altitude to be reached by unguided suborbital launch vehicles launched from the launch point. The apogee shall be obtained from one or more actual flights of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle launched at an 84 degree elevation.
              (2) An applicant shall satisfy the map and plotting data requirements of appendix A, paragraph (b).
              (3) Population data. An applicant shall use total population (N) and the total landmass area within a populated area (A) for all populated areas within an impact dispersion area. Population data up to and including 100 nm from the launch point are required at the U.S. census block group level. Population data downrange from 100 nm are required at no greater than 1° × 1° latitude/longitude grid coordinates.
              (c) Overflight Exclusion Zone and Impact Dispersion Areas
              (1) An applicant shall choose a flight azimuth from a launch point.
              (2) An applicant shall define an overflight exclusion zone as a circle with a radius of 1600 feet centered on the launch point.
              (3) An applicant shall define an impact dispersion area for each stage of the suborbital launch vehicle chosen in accordance with subparagraph (b)(1) in accordance with the following:

              (i) An applicant shall calculate the impact range for the final launch vehicle stage (Dn). An applicant shall set Dn equal to the last stage apogee altitude (Hn) multiplied by an impact range factor [IP(Hn)] in accordance with the following:
              
                ER19OC00.111
              
              where:
              
              IP(Hn) = 0.4 for an apogee less than 100 km, and
              IP(Hn) = 0.7 for an apogee of 100 km or greater.
              

              (ii) An applicant shall calculate the impact range for each intermediate stage (Di), where i ε {1, 2, 3, . . . (n− 1)}, and where n is the total number of launch vehicle stages. Using the apogee altitude (Hi) of each intermediate stage, an applicant shall use equation D1 to compute the impact range of each stage by substituting Hi for Hn. An applicant shall use the impact range factors provided by equation D1.

              (iii) An applicant shall calculate the impact dispersion radius for the final launch vehicle stage (Rn). An applicant shall set Rn equal to the last stage apogee altitude (Hn) multiplied by an impact dispersion factor [DISP(Hn)] in accordance with the following:
              
                ER19Oc00.112
              
              where:
              
              DISP(Hn) = 0.4 for an apogee less than 100 km, and
              DISP(Hn) = 0.7 for an apogee of 100 km or greater.
              

              (iv) An applicant shall calculate the impact dispersion radius for each intermediate stage (Ri), where i ε {1, 2, 3, . . . (n− 1)} and where n is the total number of launch vehicle stages. Using the apogee altitude (Hi) of each intermediate stage, an applicant shall use equation D2 to compute an impact dispersion radius of each stage by substituting Hi for Hn. An applicant shall use the dispersion factors provided by equation D2.

              (4) An applicant shall display an overflight exclusion zone, each intermediate and final stage impact point (Di through Dn), and each impact dispersion area for the intermediate and final launch vehicle stages on maps in accordance with paragraph (b)(2).
              
                
                ER19Oc00.113
              
              (d) Evaluate the Overflight Exclusion Zone and Impact Dispersion Areas
              (1) An applicant shall evaluate the overflight exclusion zone and each impact dispersion area for the presence of any populated areas. If an applicant determines that no populated area is located within the overflight exclusion zone or any impact dispersion area, then no additional steps are necessary.
              (2) If a populated area is located in an overflight exclusion zone, an applicant may modify its proposal or demonstrate that there are times when no people are present or that the applicant has an agreement in place to evacuate the public from the overflight exclusion zone during a launch.
              (3) If a populated area is located within any impact dispersion area, an applicant may modify its proposal and define a new overflight exclusion zone and new impact dispersion areas, or perform an impact risk analysis in accordance with paragraph (e).
              (e) Impact Risk Analysis

              (1) An applicant shall estimate the expected average number of casualties, EC, within the impact dispersion areas according to the following method:
              (i) An applicant shall calculate the Ec by summing the impact risk for the impact dispersion areas of the final launch vehicle stage and all intermediate stages. An applicant shall estimate Ec for the impact dispersion area of each stage by using equations D3 through D7 for each of the populated areas located within the impact dispersion areas.
              (ii) An applicant shall estimate the probability of impacting inside the X and Y sectors of each populated area within each impact dispersion area using equations D3 and D4:
              
                ER19Oc00.114
              
              where:
              
              x1, x2 = closest and farthest downrange distance to populated area (see figure D-2)
              σx = one-third of the impact dispersion radius (see figure D-2)
              exp = exponential function (ex)
              
                
                ER19Oc00.115
              
              where:
              
              y1, y2 = closest and farthest cross range distance to the populated area (see figure D-2)
              σy = one-third of the impact dispersion radius (see figure D-2)
              exp = exponential function (ex)
              
                ER19Oc00.116
              

              (iii) If a populated area intersects the impact dispersion area boundary so that the x2 or y2 distance would otherwise extend outside the impact dispersion area, the x2 or y2 distance should be set equal to the impact dispersion area radius. The x2 distance for populated area A in figure D-2 is an example.

              (iv) If a populated area intersects the flight azimuth, an applicant shall solve equation D4 by obtaining the solution in two parts. An applicant shall determine, first, the probability between y1 = 0 and y2 = a and, second, the probability between y1 = 0 and y2 = b, as depicted in figure D-3. The probability Py is then equal to the sum of the probabilities of the two parts. If a populated area intersects the line that is normal to the flight azimuth on the impact point, an applicant shall solve equation D3 by obtaining the solution in two parts in the same manner as with the values of x.
              
                
                ER19Oc00.117
              

              (v) An applicant shall calculate the probability of impact (Pi) for each populated area using the following equation:
              
                ER19Oc00.118
              
              where:
              
              Ps = probability of success = 0.98
              

              (vi) An applicant shall calculate the casualty expectancy for each populated area. Ec
                k is the casualty expectancy for a given populated area as shown in equation D6, where individual populated areas are designated with the subscript “k”.

                k { {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}
              Ac = casualty area (from table D-1)
              Ak = populated area

              (viii) Alternative casualty expectancy (Ec) analysis. An applicant may employ specified variations to the analysis defined by subparagraphs (d)(1)(i)-(vii). Those variations are identified in subparagraphs (viii)(A) through (F) of this paragraph. Subparagraphs (A) through (D) permit an applicant to make conservative assumptions that would lead to an overestimation of Ec compared with the analysis defined by subparagraphs (d)(1)(i)-(vii). In subparagraphs (E) and (F), an applicant that would otherwise fail the analysis prescribed by subparagraphs (d)(1)(i)-(vii) may avoid (d)(1)(i)-(vii)'s overestimation of the probability of impact in each populated area. An applicant employing a variation shall identify the variation used, show and discuss the specific assumptions made to modify the analysis defined by subparagraphs (d)(1)(i)-(vii), and demonstrate how each assumption leads to overestimation of the corridor Ec compared with the analysis defined by subparagraphs (d)(1)(i)-(vii).
              (A) Assume that Px and Py have a value of 1.0 for all populated areas.
              (B) Combine populated areas into one or more larger populated areas, and use a population density for the combined area or areas equal to the most densely populated area.
              (C) For any given populated area, assume Px has a value of one.
              (D) For any given populated area, assume Py has a value of one.

              (E) For a given populated area, divide the populated area into smaller rectangles, determine Pi for each individual rectangle, and sum the individual impact probabilities to determine Pi for the entire populated area.

              (F) For a given populated area, use the ratio of the populated area to the area of the Pi rectangle used in the subparagraph (d)(1)(i)-(vii) analysis.

              (2) If the estimated expected casualty does not exceed 1 × 10−4, the FAA will approve the launch point.
              (3) If the estimated expected casualty exceeds 1 × 10−4, then an applicant may modify its proposal and then repeat the impact risk analysis in accordance with this appendix D. If no set of impact dispersion areas exist which satisfy the FAA's risk threshold, the applicant's proposed launch site will fail the launch site location review.

              § 431.3
              Types of reusable launch vehicle mission licenses.
              (a) Mission-specific license. A mission-specific license authorizing an RLV mission authorizes a licensee to launch and reenter, or otherwise land, one model or type of RLV from a launch site approved for the mission to a reentry site or other location approved for the mission. A mission-specific license authorizing an RLV mission may authorize more than one RLV mission and identifies each flight of an RLV authorized under the license. A licensee's authorization to conduct RLV missions terminates upon completion of all activities authorized by the license or the expiration date stated in the reentry license, whichever occurs first.
              (b) Operator license. An operator license for RLV missions authorizes a licensee to launch and reenter, or otherwise land, any of a designated family of RLVs within authorized parameters, including launch sites and trajectories, transporting specified classes of payloads to any reentry site or other location designated in the license. An operator license for RLV missions is valid for a two-year renewable term.
            
            
              § 431.5
              Policy and safety approvals.
              To obtain either type of RLV mission license, an applicant must obtain policy and safety approvals from the FAA. Requirements for obtaining these approvals are contained in subparts B and C of this part. Only the license applicant may apply for the approvals, and may apply for either approval separately and in advance of submitting a complete license application, using the application procedures contained in part 413 of this subchapter.
            
            
              § 431.7
              Payload and payload reentry determinations.
              (a) A payload determination is required to launch a payload unless the proposed payload is exempt from payload review under § 415.53 of this chapter. Requirements for obtaining a payload determination are set forth in part 415, subpart D of this chapter.
              (b) A payload reentry determination is required to reenter a payload to Earth on an RLV unless the proposed payload is exempt from payload reentry review.
              (c) A payload reentry determination made under a previous license application under this subchapter may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
              (d) The FAA conducts a review, as described in subpart D of this part, to make a payload reentry determination. Either an RLV mission license applicant or a payload owner or operator may request a review of the proposed payload using the application procedures contained in part 413 of this subchapter. Upon receipt of an application, the FAA may conduct a payload reentry review independently of an RLV mission license application.

              (b) To satisfy risk criteria set forth in § 431.35(b)(1), an applicant for RLV mission safety approval shall identify suitable and attainable locations for nominal landing and vehicle staging impact or landing, if any. An application shall identify such locations for a contingency abort if necessary to satisfy risk criteria contained in § 431.35(b)(1) during launch of an RLV. A nominal landing, vehicle staging impact and contingency abort location are suitable for launch or reentry if—
              (1) For any vehicle or vehicle stage, the area of the predicted three-sigma dispersion of the vehicle or vehicle stage can be wholly contained within the designated location; and
              (2) The location is of sufficient size to contain landing impacts, including debris dispersion upon impact and any toxic release.
              (c) For an RLV mission—
              (1) A collision avoidance analysis shall be performed in order to maintain at least a 200-kilometer separation from any inhabitable orbiting object during launch and reentry. The analysis shall address:
              (i) For launch, closures in a planned launch window for ascent to outer space or, for an orbital RLV, to initial orbit through at least one complete orbit;
              (ii) For reentry, the reentry trajectory;
              (iii) Expansions of the closure period by subtracting 15 seconds from the closure start-time and adding 15 seconds to the closure end-time for each sequential 90 minutes elapsed time period, or portion there of, beginning at the time the state vectors of the orbiting objects were determined;
              (2) The projected instantaneous impact point (IIP) of the vehicle shall not have substantial dwell time over densely populated areas during any segment of mission flight;
              (3) There will be no unplanned physical contact between the vehicle or its components and payload after payload separation and debris generation will not result from conversion of energy sources into energy that fragments the vehicle or its payload. Energy sources include, but are not limited to, chemical, pneumatic, and kinetic energy; and
              (4) Vehicle safety operations personnel shall adhere to the following work and rest standards:
              (i) A maximum 12-hour work shift with at least 8 hours of rest after 12 hours of work, preceding initiation of an RLV reentry mission or during the conduct of a mission;
              (ii) A maximum of 60 hours worked in the 7 days, preceding initiation of an RLV mission;
              (iii) A maximum of 14 consecutive work days; and
              (iv) A minimum 48-hour rest period after 5 consecutive days of 12-hour shifts.
              (d) In addition to requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, any unproven RLV may only be operated so that during any portion of flight—
              (1) The projected instantaneous impact point (IIP) of the vehicle does not have substantial dwell time over populated areas; or

              (2) The expected number of casualties to members of the public does not exceed 1 × 10−4 given a probability of vehicle failure equal to 1 (pf=1) at any time the IIP is over a populated area;
              (e) Any RLV that enters Earth orbit may only be operated such that the vehicle operator is able to—
              (1) Monitor and verify the status of safety-critical systems before enabling reentry flight to assure the vehicle can reenter safely to Earth; and

              (2) Issue a command enabling reentry flight of the vehicle. Reentry flight cannot be initiated autonomously under nominal circumstances without prior enable.

              § 435.1
              General.
              (a) Scope. This part prescribes requirements for obtaining a license to reenter a reentry vehicle other than a reusable launch vehicle (RLV), and postlicensing requirements with which a licensee must comply to remain licensed. Requirements for preparing a license application are contained in part 413 of this subchapter.
              (b) Equivalent level of safety. Each requirement of this part applies unless the applicant or licensee clearly and convincingly demonstrates that an alternative approach provides an equivalent level of safety to the requirement of this part.

              § 435.3
              Types of reentry licenses.
              (a) Reentry-specific license. A reentry-specific license authorizes a licensee to reenter one model or type of reentry vehicle, other than an RLV, to a reentry site or other location approved for the reentry. A reentry-specific license may authorize more than one reentry and identifies each reentry authorized under the license. A licensee's authorization to reenter terminates upon completion of all activities authorized by the license or the expiration date stated in the reentry license, whichever occurs first.
              (b) Reentry-operator license. A reentry operator license authorizes a licensee to reenter any of a designated family of reentry vehicles, other than an RLV, within authorized parameters, including trajectories, transporting specified classes of payloads to any reentry site designated in the license. A reentry operator license is valid for a 2-year renewable term.
            
            
              § 435.5
              Policy and safety approvals.
              To obtain a reentry license, an applicant must obtain policy and safety approvals from the FAA. Requirements for obtaining these approvals are contained in subparts B and C of this part. Only a reentry license applicant may apply for the approvals, and may apply for either approval separately and in advance of submitting a complete license application, using the application procedures contained in part 413 of this subchapter.
            
            
              § 435.7
              Payload reentry determination.
              (a) A payload reentry determination is required to transport a payload to Earth on a reentry vehicle unless the proposed payload is exempt from payload review.
              (b) A payload reentry determination made under a previous license application under this subchapter may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

              (c) The FAA conducts a review, as described in subpart D of this part, to make a payload reentry determination. Either a reentry license applicant or a payload owner or operator may request a review of the proposed payload using the application procedures contained in part 413 of this subchapter. Upon receipt of an application, the FAA may conduct a payload reentry review independently of a reentry license application.
            
            
              § 435.8
              Human space flight.
              An applicant for a license to conduct a reentry with flight crew or a space flight participant on board the vehicle must demonstrate compliance with §§ 460.5, 460.7, 460.11, 460.13, 460.15, 460.17, 460.51 and 460.53 of this subchapter.

              (a) The FAA issues a reentry license to an applicant who has obtained all approvals and determinations required under this chapter for a reentry license.
              (b) A reentry license authorizes a licensee to reenter a reentry vehicle and payload, if any, in accordance with the representations contained in the reentry licensee's application, subject to the licensee's compliance with terms and conditions contained in license orders accompanying the reentry license, including financial responsibility requirements.
            
            
              § 435.11
              Additional license terms and conditions.

              (a) Only the FAA may transfer a reentry license.
              (b) An applicant for transfer of a reentry license shall submit a reentry license application in accordance with part 413 of this subchapter and satisfy the applicable requirements of this part. The FAA will transfer a reentry license to an applicant who has obtained all of the approvals and determinations required under this chapter for a reentry license. In conducting its reviews and issuing approvals and determinations, the FAA may incorporate any findings made part of the record to support the initial licensing determination. The FAA may modify a reentry license to reflect any changes necessary as a result of a reentry license transfer.

              (b) Other regulations—(1) Environmental. An applicant must provide enough information for the FAA to analyze the environmental impacts associated with proposed reusable suborbital rocket launches or reentries. The information provided by an applicant must be sufficient to enable the FAA to comply with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, 40 CFR parts 1500-1508.
              (2) Financial responsibility. An applicant must provide the information required by part 3 of appendix A of part 440 for the FAA to conduct a maximum probable loss analysis.
              (3) Human space flight. An applicant proposing launch or reentry with flight crew or a space flight participant on board a reusable suborbital rocket must demonstrate compliance with §§ 460.5, 460.7, 460.11, 460.13, 460.15, 460.17, 460.51 and 460.53 of this subchapter.
              
              (c) Use of a safety approval. If an applicant proposes to use any reusable suborbital rocket, safety system, process, service, or personnel for which the FAA has issued a safety approval under part 414 of this subchapter, the FAA will not reevaluate that safety element to the extent its use is within its approved envelope. As part of the application process, the FAA will evaluate the integration of that safety element into vehicle systems or operations.
              (d) Inspection before issuing a permit. Before the FAA issues an experimental permit, an applicant must make each reusable suborbital rocket planned to be flown available to the FAA for inspection. The FAA will determine whether each reusable suborbital rocket is built as represented in the application.
              (e) Other requirements. The FAA may require additional analyses, information, or agreements if necessary to protect public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.

              General.
              (a) No person may commence or conduct any launch or reentry activity that requires a license or permit unless that person has demonstrated compliance with the requirements of this part.
              (b) The FAA will prescribe the amount of financial responsibility a licensee or permittee must obtain and any adjustments of the amount in a license or permit order issued concurrent with or subsequent to the issuance of a license or a permit.
              (c) Demonstration of financial responsibility under this part shall not relieve a licensee of ultimate responsibility for liability, loss, or damage sustained by the United States resulting from a licensed activity, except to the extent that:
              (1) Liability, loss, or damage sustained by the United States results from willful misconduct of the United States or its agents;
              (2) Any covered claim of a third party for bodily injury or property damage arising out of any particular licensed activity exceeds the amount of financial responsibility required under § 440.9(c) of this part and does not exceed $1,500,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation occurring after January 1, 1989) above such amount, and are payable pursuant to 51 U.S.C. 50915 and § 440.19 of this part. A claim of an employee of any entity listed in paragraphs (1)(ii) through (1)(iii) in the Third party definition in § 440.3 of this part for bodily injury or property damage is not a covered claim;

              (3) A covered claim for property loss or damage exceeds the amount of financial responsibility required under § 440.9(e) of this part and does not result from willful misconduct of the licensee; or
              
              (4) The licensee has no liability for covered claims by third parties for bodily injury or property damage arising out of any particular launch or reentry that exceeds $1,500,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation) above the amount of financial responsibility required under § 440.9(c).
              (d) Demonstration of financial responsibility under this part does not relieve a permittee of ultimate responsibility for liability, loss, or damage sustained by the United States resulting from a permitted activity, except to the extent that:
              (1) Liability, loss, or damage sustained by the United States results from willful misconduct of the United States or its agents; or
              (2) A covered claim for property loss or damage to the United States exceeds the amount of financial responsibility required under § 440.9(e) and does not result from willful misconduct of the permittee.
              (e) A licensee's or permittee's failure to comply with any requirement of this part may result in suspension or revocation of a license or permit, and subject the licensee or permittee to civil penalties as provided in part 405 of this chapter.

              § 440.7
              Determination of maximum probable loss.
              (a) The FAA will determine the maximum probable loss (MPL) from covered claims by a third party for bodily injury or property damage, and the United States, its agencies, and its contractors and subcontractors for covered property damage or loss, resulting from a permitted or licensed activity. The maximum probable loss determination forms the basis for financial responsibility requirements issued in a license or permit order.
              (b) The FAA issues its determination of maximum probable loss no later than ninety days after a licensee or permittee has requested a determination and submitted all information required by the FAA to make the determination. The FAA will consult with Federal agencies that are involved in, or whose personnel or property are exposed to risk of damage or loss as a result of, a licensed or permitted activity before issuing a license or permit order prescribing financial responsibility requirements, and shall notify the licensee, or permittee, if interagency consultation may delay issuance of the MPL determination.
              (c) Appendix A of this part contains information requirements for obtaining a maximum probable loss determination. Any person requesting a determination of maximum probable loss must submit the information required by Appendix A, unless the FAA has waived a requirement. In lieu of submitting required information, a person requesting a maximum probable loss determination may designate and certify certain information previously submitted for a prior determination as complete, valid, and equally applicable to its current request. The requester is responsible for the continuing accuracy and completeness of information submitted under this part and must promptly report any changes in writing.
              (d) The FAA will amend a determination of maximum probable loss required under this section at any time prior to completion of licensed or permitted activities as warranted by supplementary information provided to or obtained by the FAA after the MPL determination is issued. Any change in financial responsibility requirements as a result of an amended MPL determination shall be set forth in a license or permit order.
              (e) The FAA may make a determination of maximum probable loss at any time other than as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section upon request by any person.
            
            
              § 440.9
              Insurance requirements for licensed or permitted activities.
              (a) As a condition of each license or permit, a licensee or permittee must comply with all insurance requirements of this section and of a license or permit issued by the FAA, or otherwise demonstrate the required amount of financial responsibility.

              (b) A licensee or permittee must obtain and maintain in effect a policy or policies of liability insurance, in an amount determined by the FAA under paragraph (c) of this section, that protects the following persons as additional insureds to the extent of their respective potential liabilities against covered claims by a third party for bodily injury or property damage resulting from a licensed or permitted activity:
              (1) The licensee or permittee, its customer, and their respective contractors and subcontractors, and the employees of each, involved in a licensed or permitted activity;
              (2) The United States, its agencies, and its contractors and subcontractors involved in a licensed or permitted activity; and
              (3) Government personnel.
              (c) The FAA will prescribe for each licensee or permittee the amount of insurance required to compensate the total of covered third-party claims for bodily injury or property damage resulting from a licensed or permitted activity in connection with any particular launch or reentry. A covered third-party claim includes a claim by the United States, its agencies, and its contractors and subcontractors for damage or loss to property other than property for which insurance is required under paragraph (d) of this section. The amount of insurance required is based upon the FAA's determination of maximum probable loss; however, it will not exceed the lesser of:
              (1) $500 million; or
              (2) The maximum liability insurance available on the world market at a reasonable cost, as determined by the FAA.
              (d) The licensee or permittee must obtain and maintain in effect a policy or policies of insurance, in an amount determined by the FAA under paragraph (e) of this section, that covers claims by the United States, its agencies, and its contractors and subcontractors involved in a licensed or permitted activity for property damage or loss resulting from a licensed or permitted activity. Property covered by this insurance must include all property owned, leased, or occupied by, or within the care, custody, or control of, the United States and its agencies, and its contractors and subcontractors involved in a licensed or permitted activity, at a Federal range facility. Insurance must protect the United States and its agencies, and its contractors and subcontractors involved in a licensed or permitted activity.
              (e) The FAA will prescribe for each licensee or permittee the amount of insurance required to compensate claims for property damage under paragraph (d) of this section resulting from a licensed or permitted activity in connection with any particular launch or reentry. The amount of insurance is based upon a determination of maximum probable loss; however, it will not exceed the lesser of:
              (1) $100 million; or
              (2) The maximum available on the world market at a reasonable cost, as determined by the FAA.
              (f) In lieu of a policy of insurance, a licensee or permittee may demonstrate financial responsibility in another manner meeting the terms and conditions for insurance of this part. The licensee or permittee must describe in detail the method proposed for demonstrating financial responsibility and how it ensures that the licensee or permittee is able to cover claims as required under this part.
            
            
              § 440.11
              Duration of coverage for licensed launch, including suborbital launch, or permitted activities; modifications.
              (a) Insurance coverage required under § 440.9, or other form of financial responsibility, shall attach when a licensed launch or permitted activity starts, and remain in full force and effect as follows:
              (1) Until completion of licensed launch or permitted activities at a launch or reentry site; and
              (2) For orbital launch, until the later of—
              (i) Thirty days following payload separation, or attempted payload separation in the event of a payload separation anomaly; or
              (ii) Thirty days from ignition of the launch vehicle.
              (3) For a suborbital launch, until the later of—
              (i) Motor impact and payload recovery; or

              (ii) The FAA's determination that risk to third parties and Government property as a result of licensed launch or permitted activities is sufficiently small that financial responsibility is no longer necessary. That determination is made through the risk analysis conducted before the launch to determine MPL and specified in a license or permit order.
              (b) Financial responsibility required under this part may not be replaced, canceled, changed, withdrawn, or in any way modified to reduce the limits of liability or the extent of coverage, nor expire by its own terms, prior to the time specified in a license or permit order, unless the FAA is notified at least 30 days in advance and expressly approves the modification.
            
            
              § 440.12
              Duration of coverage for licensed reentry; modifications.
              (a) For reentry, insurance coverage required under § 440.9, or other form of financial responsibility, shall attach upon commencement of licensed reentry, and remain in full force and effect as follows:
              (1) For ground operations, until completion of licensed reentry at the reentry site; and
              (2) For other licensed reentry activities, 30 days from initiation of reentry flight; however, in the event of an abort that results in the reentry vehicle remaining on orbit, insurance shall remain in place until the FAA's determination that risk to third parties and Government property as a result of licensed reentry is sufficiently small that financial responsibility is no longer necessary, as determined by the FAA through the risk analysis conducted to determine MPL and specified in a license order.
              (b) Financial responsibility required under this part may not be replaced, canceled, changed, withdrawn, or in any way modified to reduce the limits of liability or the extent of coverage, nor expire by its own terms, prior to the time specified in a license order, unless the FAA is notified at least 30 days in advance and expressly approves the modification.
            
            
              § 440.13
              Standard conditions of insurance coverage.
              (a) Insurance obtained under § 440.9 must comply with each of the following terms and conditions of coverage:
              (1) Bankruptcy or insolvency of an insured, including any additional insured, shall not relieve an insurer of any of its obligations under any policy.
              (2) Policy limits shall apply separately to each occurrence and, for each occurrence to the total of claims arising out of a licensed or permitted activity in connection with any particular launch or reentry.
              (3) Except as provided in this section, each policy must pay claims from the first dollar of loss, without regard to any deductible, to the limits of the policy. A licensee or permittee may obtain a policy containing a deductible amount if the amount of the deductible is placed in an escrow account or otherwise demonstrated to be unobligated, unencumbered funds of the licensee or permittee, available to compensate claims at any time claims may arise.
              (4) No policy may be invalidated by any action or inaction of the licensee or permittee or any additional insured, even by nonpayment by the licensee or permittee of the policy premium, and each policy must insure the licensee or permittee and each additional insured regardless of any breach or violation of any warranties, declarations, or conditions contained in the policies by the licensee or permittee or any additional insured (other than a breach or violation by the licensee, permittee or an additional insured, and then only as against that licensee, permittee or additional insured).
              (5) Each exclusion from coverage must be specified.
              (6) Insurance shall be primary without right of contribution from any other insurance that is carried by the licensee or permittee or any additional insured.
              (7) Each policy must expressly provide that all of its provisions, except the policy limits, operate in the same manner as if there were a separate policy with and covering the licensee or permittee and each additional insured.
              (8) Each policy must be placed with an insurer of recognized reputation and responsibility that either:

              (i) Is licensed to do business in any State, territory, possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia; or
              
              (ii) Includes in each of its policies or insurance obtained under this part a contract clause in which the insurer agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction within the United States and designates an authorized agent within the United States for service of legal process on the insurer.
              (9) Except as to claims resulting from the willful misconduct of the United States or any of its agents, the insurer shall waive any and all rights of subrogation against each of the parties protected by required insurance.

              (a) A licensee or permittee must submit to the FAA evidence of financial responsibility and compliance with allocation of risk requirements under this part, as follows, unless a license or permit order specifies otherwise due to the proximity of the intended date for commencement of licensed or permitted activities:
              (1) All reciprocal waiver of claims agreements required under § 440.17(c) must be submitted at least 30 days before the start of any licensed or permitted activity involving a customer, crew member, or space flight participant;
              (2) Evidence of insurance must be submitted at least 30 days before commencement of any licensed launch or permitted activity, and for licensed reentry no less than 30 days before commencement of launch activities involving the reentry licensee;

              (4) Evidence of renewal of insurance or other form of financial responsibility must be submitted at least 30 days in advance of its expiration date.
              (b) Upon a complete demonstration of compliance with financial responsibility and allocation of risk requirements under this part, the requirements of this part shall preempt each and any provision in any agreement between the licensee or permittee and an agency of the United States governing access to or use of United States launch or reentry property or launch or reentry services for a licensed or permitted activity which addresses financial responsibility, allocation of risk and related matters covered by 51 U.S.C. 50914, 50915.
              (c) A licensee or permittee must demonstrate compliance as follows:
              (1) The licensee or permittee must provide proof of the existence of the insurance required by § 440.9 by:
              (i) Certifying to the FAA that it has obtained insurance in compliance with the requirements of this part and any applicable license or permit order;

              (iii) In the event of any policy exclusions or limitations of coverage that may be considered usual under § 440.19(c), or for purposes of implementing the Government's waiver of claims for property damage under 51 U.S.C. 50914(b), certifying that insurance covering the excluded risks is not commercially available at reasonable cost; and
              (iv) Submitting to the FAA, for signature by the Department on behalf of the United States Government, the waiver of claims and assumption of responsibility agreement required by § 440.17(c), executed by the licensee or permittee and its customer.

              § 440.17
              Reciprocal waiver of claims requirements.
              (a) As a condition of each license or permit, the licensee or permittee must comply with the reciprocal waiver of claims requirements of this section.
              (b) The licensee or permittee and each of its contractors and subcontractors, each customer, and each customer's contractors and subcontractors, must enter into a reciprocal waiver of claims agreement under which each party waives and releases claims against all the other parties to the waiver and against any other customer, and agrees to assume financial responsibility for property damage it sustains and for bodily injury or property damage sustained by its own employees, and to hold harmless and indemnify each other from bodily injury or property damage sustained by its employees, resulting from a licensed or permitted activity, regardless of fault.
              (1) The licensee or permittee must extend the reciprocal waiver of claims requirements to each of its contractors and subcontractors involved in launch or reentry services, and each of its first-tier customers.
              (2) Any first-tier customer must extend the reciprocal waiver of claims requirements to each of its contractors and subcontractors involved in launch or reentry services, and each of its customers.
              (3) Any part 440 customer must extend the reciprocal waiver of claims requirements to each of its contractors and subcontractors involved in launch or reentry services, and each of its customers.

The reciprocal waiver of claims must be in the form set forth in appendix B of this part for a licensed activity, in appendix C of this part for a permitted activity, or in a form that otherwise provides all the same obligations and benefits. The reciprocal waiver of claims must provide that:
              (1) Each party to the reciprocal waiver of claims, including the United States but only to the extent provided in legislation:
              (i) Waives and releases claims it may have against each other party to the reciprocal waiver of claims, any customer, and against their respective contractors and subcontractors, for property damage it sustains and for bodily injury or property damage sustained by its own employees, resulting from licensed or permitted activities, regardless of fault;

              (ii) Assumes responsibility for property damage it sustains and for bodily injury or property damage sustained by its own employees, resulting from licensed or permitted activities, regardless of fault. A licensee or permittee and each first-tier customer shall each hold harmless and indemnify each other, the United States, any other customer, and the contractors and subcontractors of each for bodily injury or property damage sustained by its own employees, resulting from licensed or permitted activities, regardless of fault; and
              (iii) Extends the requirements of the waiver and release of claims, and the assumption of responsibility, hold harmless, and indemnification, to its contractors and subcontractors involved in launch and reentry services, and, for each customer, to its contractors and subcontractors involved in launch and reentry services, and customers, by requiring them to waive and release all claims as follows:
              (A) For each contractor and subcontractor of the licensee or permittee, all claims against any customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, and to agree to be responsible for property damage they sustain and to be responsible, hold harmless and indemnify any customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, for bodily injury or property damage sustained by their own employees, resulting from licensed activities, regardless of fault;
              (B) For each contractor and subcontractor of any customer, all claims against the licensee or permittee, any other customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, and to agree to be responsible for property damage they sustain and to be responsible, hold harmless and indemnify the licensee or permittee, any other customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, for bodily injury or property damage sustained by their own employees, resulting from licensed activities, regardless of fault;
              (C) For each contractor and subcontractor of the United States, all claims against the licensee or permittee, any customer, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, and to agree to be responsible for property damage they sustain and to be responsible, hold harmless and indemnify the licensee or permittee, any other customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, for bodily injury or property damage sustained by their own employees, resulting from licensed activities, regardless of fault to the extent that claims they would otherwise have for such damage or injury exceed the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under § 440.9(c) and (e);
              (D) For each part 440 customer, all claims against the licensee or permittee, any other customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors; and to agree to be responsible for property damage they sustain and to be responsible, hold harmless and indemnify the licensee or permittee, any other customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, for bodily injury or property damage sustained by their own employees, resulting from licensed activities, regardless of fault; and
              (2) For the following parties—
              (i) The licensee or permittee must hold harmless and indemnify each first-tier customer and its directors, officers, servants, agents, subsidiaries, employees and assignees, or any of them; the United States and its servants, agents, subsidiaries, employees and assignees, or any of them; and any part 440 customer and its directors, officers, servants, agents, subsidiaries, employees and assignees, or any of them from and against liability, loss or damage arising out of claims that any of licensee's or permittee's contractors and subcontractors may have for property damage sustained by them and for bodily injury or property damage sustained by their employees, resulting from licensed or permitted activities and arising out of the indemnifying party's failure to implement properly the waiver requirement. The requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section to hold harmless and indemnify the United States and its servants, agents, subsidiaries, employees and assignees, or any of them, does not apply when:
              (A) Claims result from willful misconduct of the United States or its agents;

              (B) Claims for property damage sustained by the United States or its contractors and subcontractors exceed the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under § 440.9(e);
              
              (C) For licensed activity, claims by a third party for bodily injury or property damage exceed the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under § 440.9(c), and do not exceed $1,500,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation after January 1, 1989) above such amount, and are payable pursuant to the provisions of 51 U.S.C. 50915 and § 440.19; or
              (D) The licensee has no liability for claims exceeding $1,500,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation after January 1, 1989) above the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under § 440.9(c).

              § 440.19
              United States payment of excess third-party liability claims.
              (a) The United States pays successful covered claims (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) of a third party against a licensee, a customer, and the contractors and subcontractors of the licensee and the customer, and the employees of each involved in licensed activities, and the contractors and subcontractors of the United States and its agencies, and their employees, involved in licensed activities to the extent provided in an appropriation law or other legislative authority providing for payment of claims in accordance with 51 U.S.C. 50915, and to the extent the total amount of such covered claims arising out of any particular launch or reentry:
              (b) Payment by the United States under paragraph (a) of this section shall not be made for any part of such claims for which bodily injury or property damage results from willful misconduct by the party seeking payment.
              (c) The United States shall provide for payment of claims by third parties for bodily injury or property damage that are payable under 49 U.S.C. 70113 and not covered by required insurance under § 440.9(b), without regard to the limitation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, because of an insurance policy exclusion that is usual. A policy exclusion is considered usual only if insurance covering the excluded risk is not commercially available at reasonable rates. The licensee must submit a certification in accordance with § 440.15(c)(1)(iii) of this part for the United States to cover the claims.
              (d) Upon the expiration of the policy period prescribed in accordance with § 440.11(a), the United States shall provide for payment of claims that are payable under 51 U.S.C. 50915 from the first dollar of loss up to $1,500,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation occurring after January 1, 1989).
              (e) Payment by the United States of excess third-party claims under 51 U.S.C. 50915 shall be subject to:
              (1) Prompt notice by the licensee to the FAA that the total amount of claims arising out of licensed activities exceeds, or is likely to exceed, the required amount of financial responsibility. For each claim, the notice must specify the nature, cause, and amount of the claim or lawsuit associated with the claim, and the party or parties who may otherwise be liable for payment of the claim;
              (2) Participation or assistance in the defense of the claim or lawsuit by the United States, at its election;

              (3) Approval by the FAA of any settlement, or part of a settlement, to be paid by the United States; and
              
              (4) Approval by Congress of a compensation plan prepared by the FAA and submitted by the President.
              (f) The FAA will:
              (1) Prepare a compensation plan outlining the total amount of claims and meeting the requirements set forth in 51 U.S.C. 50915;
              (2) Recommend sources of funds to pay the claims; and
              (3) Propose legislation as required to implement the plan.
              (g) The FAA may withhold payment of a claim if it finds that the amount is unreasonable, unless it is the final order of a court that has jurisdiction over the matter.
