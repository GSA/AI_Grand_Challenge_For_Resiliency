      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

The basis for denial shall be provided to the applicant upon request.</P>
          <P>(e) The superintendent shall include in a permit the terms and conditions that the superintendent deems necessary to protect park resources or public safety and may also include terms or conditions established pursuant to the authority of any other section of this chapter.</P>

          <SUBJECT>What is the applicability and scope of this part?</SUBJECT>
          <P>The applicability of the regulations in this part is described in § 1 .2 of this chapter.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 3.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Do other boating laws and regulations apply to me when I operate my boat on park waters?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In addition to the regulations contained in this part, the NPS adopts applicable laws and regulations of the United States Coast Guard. The USCG laws and regulations are found in Title 14 United States Code, Title 33 United States Code, Title 46 United States Code, and 33 CFR chapter I, 46 CFR chapter I and III and 49 CFR chapter IV. NPS applies the adopted laws and regulations to vessels and their operation on all waters (navigable and non-navigable) subject to NPS jurisdiction. Therefore, Federal regulations authorizing an action by the “captain of the port” or another officer or employee of the United States Coast Guard, authorize a like action by the superintendent.</P>
          <P>(b) Except to the extent that directives of the United States Coast Guard have expressly or implicitly preempted inconsistent state laws and regulations or as otherwise provided by subsection (a), vessels and their operation on all waters subject to NPS jurisdiction are governed by non-conflicting boating safety laws and regulations of the State within whose interior boundaries a park area or portion thereof is located.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 3.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Am I required to obtain a permit to operate a vessel in a park area?</SUBJECT>
          <P>Generally, you are not required to obtain a permit to operate a vessel in a park area. However, in certain circumstances, taking into consideration public safety, protection of park resources, and weather and park management objectives, the superintendent may require a permit for use of a vessel within a park area, under §§ 1.5 and 1.7, and will issue permits consistent with § 1.6 of this chapter.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 3.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>For what purposes may my vessel be inspected?</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) An authorized person may at any time stop and/or board a vessel to examine documents, licenses or permits relating to operation of the vessel, and to inspect the vessel to determine compliance with regulations pertaining to <PRTPAGE P="38"/>safety equipment, vessel capacity, marine sanitation devices, and other pollution and noise abatement requirements.</P>
          <P>(b) An authorized person who identifies a vessel being operated without sufficient life saving or firefighting devices, in an overloaded or other unsafe condition, as defined in United States Coast Guard regulations, or in violation of a noise level specified in § 3.15(a) of this part, may direct the operator to suspend further use of the vessel until the condition is corrected.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 3.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Do I have to report an accident involving a vessel to the National Park Service?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The operator of a vessel involved in an accident must report the accident to the superintendent as soon as practical, but in any event within 24 hours of the accident, if the accident involves:</P>
          <P>(1) Total property damage of $2000 or more; or</P>
          <P>(2) Injury, or death or disappearance of a person</P>
          <P>(b) If the operator is physically incapable of making the report, the owner or an occupant of the vessel must report the accident to the superintendent.</P>
          <P>(c) Filing a report with the superintendent may satisfy applicable United States Coast Guard, State, and local accident reporting requirements. Superintendents will forward the accident report to the appropriate reporting authority in a timely manner that complies with the requirements of 33 CFR 173.55.</P>

          <SUBJECT>What are the requirements to operate a power driven vessel?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) To operate a power-driven vessel on park waters, a person must be either:</P>
          <P>(1) At least 16 years old; or</P>
          <P>(2) Between 12 and 15 years old and accompanied on the vessel by a person at least 18 years old.</P>
          <P>(b) If a park area is located within a State having different age requirements, then the applicable State law is adopted in lieu of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) If a park area is located within a State having a mandatory boater education requirement, then that State requirement is adopted.</P>

          <P>(2) Launching or recovering a vessel, except at a launch site designated by the superintendent.</P>
          <P>(3) Operating a power-driven vessel on waters not accessible by road.</P>
          <P>(4) Operating a vessel in excess of a length, width, or horsepower restriction established by the superintendent in accordance with §§ 1.5 and 1.7 of this chapter. For the purposes of this paragraph, vessel length is measured according to criteria established in 46 CFR chapter I or 33 CFR chapter I.</P>
          <P>(b) The following operations are inherently unsafe and therefore prohibited:</P>
          <P>(1) Operating a power-driven or sailing vessel within 100 feet of a diver's flag except a vessel in support of dive operations, which may not be operated in excess of flat wake speed.</P>
          <P>(2) Failing to observe restriction(s) established by a regulatory marker.</P>
          <P>(3) Operating a vessel in excess of flat wake speed in designated areas.</P>
          <P>(4) Operating a vessel in excess of flat wake speed within 100 feet of:</P>
          <P>(i) A downed water skier;</P>
          <P>(ii) A person swimming, wading, fishing from shore or floating with the aid of a flotation device;</P>
          <P>(iii) A designated launch site; or</P>
          <P>(iv) A manually propelled, anchored or drifting vessel. If the park is located within a State specifying different conditions, then that State law is adopted in lieu of this paragraph.</P>

          <P>(5) Unless a designated area is marked otherwise, operating a power-<PRTPAGE P="39"/>driven or sailing vessel within 500 feet of a shoreline designated as a swimming beach. This prohibition does not apply in locations such as a river, channel, or narrow cove where passage is restricted to less than 500 feet. In such restrictive locations where swim beaches are designated, the operation of a vessel in excess of a flat wake speed is prohibited.</P>
          <P>(6) Operating a power-driven vessel while a person is riding on the decking over the bow, gunwales, top edge of the transom, motor cover, or in any other unsafe position when the vessel is being operated. This provision does not apply when that portion of the vessel is designed and constructed for the purpose of carrying passengers safely at all speeds or when the vessel is maneuvering for anchoring, docking or mooring.</P>
          <P>(7) Operating a power driven vessel engine/s or generator with a person sitting, riding or hanging on to a swim platform or swim ladder.</P>
          <P>(8) Operating a vessel, or knowingly allowing another person to operate a vessel in a negligent manner, by failing to exercise that degree of care which a reasonable person, under like circumstances, would demonstrate in order to prevent the endangering of the life, limb, or property of a person(s) through the operator's lack of knowledge, inattention, or general carelessness.</P>
          <P>(9) Operating a vessel or knowingly allowing another person to operate a vessel in a grossly negligent manner, by willfully and wantonly creating an unreasonable risk of harm to person(s) or property, regardless of whether the operator intended to cause harm.</P>

          <P>(1) Under the influence of alcohol, a drug or drugs, or any combination thereof, to a degree that renders the operator incapable of safe operation; or</P>
          <P>(2) The alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath is 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.</P>
          <P>(b) If State law that applies to operating a vessel while under the influence of alcohol establishes more restrictive limits of alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath, those limits apply rather than the limits specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

          <P>(a) At the request or direction of an authorized person who has probable cause to believe that an operator of a vessel has violated provisions of § 3.10, the operator must submit to one or more testing procedures of the blood, breath, saliva or urine for the purpose of determining blood alcohol and/or drug content.</P>
          <P>(1) Refusal by an operator to submit to a test is prohibited and proof of refusal may be admissible in any related judicial proceeding.</P>
          <P>(2) Any test or tests for the presence of alcohol and drugs must be determined by and administered at the direction of an authorized person.</P>
          <P>(3) Any test must be conducted by using accepted scientific methods and equipment of proven accuracy and reliability operated by personnel certified in its use.</P>
          <P>(b) The results of chemical or other quantitative tests are intended to supplement the elements of probable cause used as the basis for the arrest of an operator charged with a violation of § 3.10. If the alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath at the time of testing is less than alcohol concentrations specified in § 3.10(a)(2), this fact does not give rise to any presumption that the operator is or is not under the influence of alcohol.</P>
          <P>(c) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are not intended to limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether the operator, at the time of the alleged violation, was under the influence of alcohol, or a drug, or drugs, or any combination thereof.</P>

          <P>(2) Refusal by an operator to submit to a test under paragraph (c)(1) is prohibited and proof of refusal may be admissible in any related judicial proceeding.</P>
          <P>(3) Absent exigent circumstances, an operator cannot ordinarily be required to submit blood samples for the purpose of determining blood alcohol and drug content unless it occurs through a search warrant. An authorized person who has probable cause to believe that an operator of a motor vehicle within a park area has violated a provision of paragraph (a) of this section shall get a search warrant, except when exigent circumstances exist, to obtain any blood samples from the operator for the purpose of determining blood alcohol and drug content.</P>
          <P>(4) Any test or tests for the presence of alcohol and drugs shall be determined by and administered at the direction of an authorized person.</P>

If the alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath at the time of testing is less than alcohol concentrations specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, this fact does not give rise to any presumption that the operator is or is not under the influence of alcohol.</P>
          <P>(2) The provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are not intended to limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether the operator, at the time of the alleged violation, was under the influence of alcohol, or a drug, or drugs, or any combination thereof.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative roads.</E> Administrative roads are roads that are closed to motor vehicle use by the public, but open to motor vehicle use for administrative purposes. The superintendent may authorize bicycle use on an administrative road. Before authorizing bicycle use on an administrative road the superintendent must:</P>
          <P>(1) Make a written determination that such bicycle use is consistent with protection of the park area's natural, scenic and aesthetic values, safety considerations and management objectives, and will not disturb wildlife or park resources; and</P>
          <P>(2) Notify the public through one or more methods listed in § 1.7(a) of this chapter.</P>
          <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Existing trails.</E> The superintendent may authorize by designation bicycle use on a hiking or horse trail that currently exists on the ground and does not require any construction or significant modification to accommodate bicycles. Before doing so, the superintendent must ensure that all of the following requirements have been satisfied:</P>
          <P>(1) The superintendent must complete a park planning document that addresses bicycle use on the specific trail and that includes an evaluation of:</P>

          <P>(i) The suitability of the trail surface and soil conditions for accommodating bicycle use. The evaluation must include any maintenance, minor rehabilitation or armoring that is necessary to upgrade the trail to sustainable condition; and<PRTPAGE P="46"/>
          </P>
          <P>(ii) Life cycle maintenance costs, safety considerations, methods to prevent or minimize user conflict, methods to protect natural and cultural resources and mitigate impacts, and integration with commercial services and alternative transportation systems (if applicable).</P>
          <P>(2) The superintendent must complete either an environmental assessment (EA) or an environmental impact statement (EIS) evaluating the effects of bicycle use in the park and on the specific trail. The superintendent must provide the public with notice of the availability of the EA and at least 30 days to review and comment on an EA completed under this section.</P>
          <P>(3) The superintendent must complete a written determination stating that the addition of bicycle use on the existing hiking or horse trail is consistent with the protection of the park area's natural, scenic and aesthetic values, safety considerations and management objectives, and will not disturb wildlife or park resources.</P>

          <P>(4)(i) If under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the resulting Finding of No Significant Impact, Record of Decision (ROD), or an amended ROD concludes that bicycle use on the specific trail will have no significant impacts, the superintendent must publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> providing the public at least 30 days to review and comment on the written determination required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section. After consideration of the comments submitted, the superintendent must obtain the Regional Director's written approval of the determination required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section; or</P>
          <P>(ii) If under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the conclusion is that bicycle use on the specific trail may have a significant impact, the superintendent with the concurrence of the Regional Director must complete a concise written statement for inclusion in the project files that bicycle use cannot be authorized on the specific trail.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">New trails.</E> This paragraph applies to new trails that do not exist on the ground and therefore would require trail construction activities (such as clearing brush, cutting trees, excavation, or surface treatment). New trails shall be developed and constructed in accordance with appropriate NPS sustainable trail design principles and guidelines. The superintendent may develop, construct, and authorize new trails for bicycle use after:</P>

          <P>(1) In a developed area, the superintendent completes the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section, publishes a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> providing the public at least 30 days to review and comment on the written determination required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and after consideration of the comments submitted, obtains the Regional Director's written approval of the determination required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section; or</P>
          <P>(2) Outside of a developed area, the superintendent completes the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section; obtains the Regional Director's written approval of the determination required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and promulgates a special regulation authorizing the bicycle use.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Closures and other use restrictions.</E> A superintendent may limit or restrict or impose conditions on bicycle use or may close any park road, parking area, administrative road, trail, or portion thereof to bicycle use, or terminate such condition, closure, limit or restriction after:</P>

          <P>(1) In granting or refusing applications for permits as herein provided, the Regional Directors shall take into consideration the character of the neighborhood, the availability of other liquor-dispensing facilities, the local laws governing the sale of liquor, and any other local factors which have a relationship to the privilege requested.</P>
          <P>(2) A fee will be charged for the issuance of such a permit, corresponding to that charged for the exercise of similar privileges outside the park area boundaries by the State government, or appropriate political subdivision thereof within whose exterior boundaries the place covered by the permit is situated.</P>

          <P>(3) The applicant or permittee may appeal to the Director from any final <PRTPAGE P="48"/>action of the appropriate Regional Director refusing, conditioning or revoking the permit.

          <P>Engaging in or soliciting any business in park areas, except in accordance with the provisions of a permit, contract, or other written agreement with the United States, except as such may be specifically authorized under special regulations applicable to a park area, is prohibited.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 5.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Commercial passenger-carrying motor vehicles.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The commercial transportation of passengers by motor vehicles except as authorized under a contract or permit from the Secretary or his authorized representative is prohibited in Crater Lake (prohibition is limited to sightseeing tours on the rim drive), Glacier (prohibition does not apply to nonscheduled tours on portions of the park road as defined in § 7.3 of this chapter), Grand Canyon (prohibition does not apply to the north rim or to nonscheduled tours as defined in § 7.4 of this chapter), Grand Teton (prohibition does not apply to those portions of Highways Nos. 26, 89, 187, and 287 commencing at the south boundary of the park and running in a general northerly direction to the east and north boundaries of the park), Mesa Verde (prohibition does not apply to transportation between points within the park and outside points), Denali National Park and Preserve (prohibition does not apply to that portion of the Denali Park road between the Highway 3 junction and the Denali Park Railroad Depot), Sequoia-Kings Canyon, Yellowstone (prohibition does not apply to nonscheduled tours as defined in § 7.13 of this chapter, nor to that portion of U.S. Highway 191 traversing the northwest corner of the park) and Yosemite National Parks. The following principles will govern the interpretation and enforcement of the section:</P>
          <P>(1) Transportation is commercial if it is operated primarily as a business activity or for profit of the operator, or if any person or organization may receive a profit, commission, fee, brokerage or other compensation for organizing, advertising, promoting, soliciting or selling the trip or tour of which such transportation is a part.</P>

          <P>(2) Transportation is commercial if payment therefor is made directly or indirectly to the operator: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That bona fide sharing of actual expenses will not be deemed a payment.</P>
          <P>(3) Transportation by a motor vehicle licensed as a commercial vehicle, or of commercial type, will be presumed to be commercial unless otherwise established to the satisfaction of the Superintendent or his authorized representative.</P>
          <P>(4) Transportation will not be deemed commercial for the sole reason that the motor vehicle is chartered or rented in good faith to the operator, by the owner, for general use at a charge based upon time or mileage or both. Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the operation of pleasure type automobiles rented without a driver on the normal terms from the owner.</P>

          <P>(5) Subject to the provision of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, transportation is not commercial if it is a part of a trip or tour initiated, organized, and directed by an established bona fide school or college, institution, society or other organization, as a nonprofit activity of such organization, <PRTPAGE P="49"/>and if all passengers are students, faculty, members, or employees of such organization, or otherwise connected therewith, provided that credentials are presented at the park entrance from the head of such institution or organization indicating the trip is in accordance with the provisions stipulated herein. Clubs or associations having as a principal purpose the arranging of tours, trips, or transportation for their members will not qualify for admission into the above-named parks under the provision of this paragraph.</P>
          <P>(6) As used in this section, “owner” means the person or organization having legal title, or all the incidents of ownership other than legal title, of a motor vehicle by which passengers may be transported, and includes a registered owner or a purchaser under a conditional sales contract. “Operator” means the person, organization, or group that arranges for the transportation, assumes responsibility for financial risk and management, and determines who shall be transported upon what terms, conditions, or charges. The operator may be the owner, but need not be.</P>
          <P>(b) Passenger-carrying motor vehicles, otherwise admissible, that are so large as to require special escort in order to proceed safely over park roads, or which in the judgment of the Superintendent are beyond the carrying capacity or safety factor of the roads, will not be permitted in the parks, except that, where they may satisfactorily enter and travel to park headquarters they may be parked there during the period of stay.</P>

            <TNOTE>* Commercially guided snowmobile tours originating at the North Entrance and Old Faithful are currently provided solely by one concessioner. Because this concessioner is the sole provider at both of these areas, this regulation allows reallocation of snowmobiles between the North Entrance and Old Faithful as necessary, so long as the total daily number of snowmobiles originating from the two locations does not exceed 24. For example, the concessioner could operate 6 snowmobiles at Old Faithful and 18 at the North Entrance if visitor demand warranted it. This will allow the concessioner to respond to changing visitor demand for commercially guided snowmobile tours, thus enhancing the availability of visitor services in Yellowstone.</TNOTE>

          <SUBJECT>Shenandoah National Park.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Backcountry camping.</E> For purposes of clarification at Shenandoah National Park, “backcountry camping” is defined as any use of portable shelter or sleeping equipment in the backcountry. “Backcountry” is defined as those areas of the park which are more than 250 yards from a paved road, and more than one-half mile from any park facilities other than trails, unpaved roads and trail shelters. The Superintendent may designate areas where backcountry camping is prohibited if there would be potential damage to park resources or disruption to other park uses. Such areas will be marked on maps available in the Superintendent's office, visitor centers and ranger stations. A person or group of persons may camp overnight at any other backcountry location within the park, except:</P>
          <P>(1) No person or group of persons traveling together may camp without a valid backcountry camping permit. The issuance of this permit may be denied when such action is necessary to protect park resources or park visitors, or to regulate levels of visitor use in legislatively-designated wilderness areas;</P>
          <P>(2) No person may camp in or with a group of more than nine (9) other persons;</P>
          <P>(3) No person or group may backcountry camp:</P>
          <P>(i) Within 250 yards or in view from any paved park road or the park boundary;</P>
          <P>(ii) Within one-half mile or in view from any automobile campground, lodge, restaurant, visitor center, picnic area, ranger station, administrative or maintenance area, or other park development or facility except a trail, an unpaved road or a trail shelter;</P>
          <P>(iii) On or in view from any trail or unpaved road, or within sight of any sign which has been posted by park authorities to designate a no camping area;</P>

          <P>(iv) Within view of another camping party, or inside or within view from a trail shelter: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That backcountry campers may seek shelter and sleep within or adjacent to a trail shelter with other camping groups, during periods of severely unseasonable weather when the protection and amenities of such shelter are deemed essential;</P>
          <P>(v) Within 25 feet of any stream; and</P>
          <P>(4) No person shall backcountry camp more than two (2) consecutive nights at a single location. The term “location” shall mean that particular campsite and the surrounding area within a two hundred fifty (250) yard radius of that campsite.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Powerless flight.</E> The use of devices designed to carry persons through the air in powerless flight is allowed at times and locations designated by the <PRTPAGE P="85"/>superintendent, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit.</P>

Permits will be issued only for those motor vehicles whose travel on Seashore lands is deemed by the Superintendent to be essential to the management or enjoyment of Seashore resources, or to the occupancy of residences or the ownership of real property on the island. In making this determination, the Superintendent shall consider the purposes of the Act in providing for the conservation and preservation of the natural resources of the Seashore and for the enjoyment of these resources by the public; the scope and purpose of such travel; the availability of alternative transportation on the day or days when the applicant for a permit requests to travel on Seashore lands; the present or past issuance of other permits to the applicant; any limitations on numbers of permits established pursuant to paragraph (a)(8); and, in the case of public utility, service, and official vehicles, the feasibility of basing such vehicles and related equipment on the island rather than the mainland.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Vehicle restrictions.</E> Any motor vehicle whose owner or operator has been found to qualify for a permit, according to the standards set forth in paragraphs (a) (5) and (6), must, prior to the issuance of such permit:</P>
          <P>(i) Have a valid permit or other authorization for operation on the island issued by the local government agency or agencies within whose jurisdiction the travel is to be performed, if such permission or authorization is required by such agency or agencies.</P>
          <P>(ii) Be capable of four-wheel drive operation.</P>
          <P>(iii) Have a rated gross vehicle weight not in excess of 10,000 pounds, unless the use of a larger vehicle will result in a reduction of overall motor vehicle travel.</P>
          <P>(iv) Meet the requirements of § 4.10(c)(3) of this chapter and conform to all applicable State laws regarding licensing, registration, inspection, insurance, and required equipment.</P>

In establishing or revising such limits, the Superintendent shall consider such factors as the type of use or purpose for which travel is authorized, the availability of other means of transportation, limits established by local jurisdictions, historic patterns of use, conflicts with other users, existing multiple permits held by individuals or a household, aesthetic and scenic values, visitor uses, safety, soil, weather, erosion, terrain, wildlife, vegetation, noise, and management capabilities. A revision of these limitations shall be published as a rule in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> except in emergency situations when closures may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of § 1.5 and § 1.7 of this chapter.</P>
          <P>(ii) Limitations on permits for motor vehicle travel on Seashore lands, according to eligible applicant category, are as follows:</P>
          <P>(A) <E T="03">Year-round residents.</E> No more than 145 permits at any time are issued to year-round residents. A year-round resident who is denied a permit because the limit has been reached is placed on <PRTPAGE P="93"/>a waiting list. When the number of outstanding permits drops below 145, permits are issued in order of the date of receipt of the application. When multiple applications are received on the same day, priority is given to persons both living and working full time on the Island. One year-round resident permit is allowed per household. Permit applications are mailed by the Superintendent by December 1 of each year to those year-round residents eligible to renew their permit. The deadline for receipt of completed applications is January 31 of the permit year. Applications received after January 31 are not considered as renewals of existing permits. Should the 145 limit be reached, late applications are placed at the end of the waiting list.</P>
          <P>(B) <E T="03">Part-time residents.</E> Permits are issued only to part-time residents who held a residential permit as of January 1, 1978. No more than 100 part-time resident permits are issued. A part-time resident who becomes a year-round resident is eligible to apply for a year-round resident permit in accordance with paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(A) of this section. A year-round resident permit holder as of January 1, 1978, who no longer qualifies as a year-round resident, may be eligible to obtain a part-time resident permit as long as the 100 limit is not exceeded and the part-time resident definition is satisfied.</P>
          <P>(C) <E T="03">Holders of reserved rights of use and occupancy.</E> A holder of a reserved right of use and occupancy, or a lessee thereof, occupying a property acquired by the National Park Service in the eight-mile area described in the Act, is issued a permit consistent with the terms under which the right of use and occupancy is retained.</P>
          <P>(D) <E T="03">Public utility and essential service vehicles.</E> No more than 30 permits at any time are issued to public utility and essential service vehicles. After consultation with the property owners' association of the appropriate unincorporated community or the village clerk for the Villages of Ocean Beach and Saltaire, the Superintendent may apportion permits to allow minimal service needs to each community.</P>
          <P>(E) <E T="03">Construction and business vehicles.</E> No more than 80 permits at any time are issued to construction and business vehicles. An operator of a construction or business vehicle who is denied a permit because the limit has been reached is placed on a waiting list. When the number of outstanding permits drops below 80, permits are issued in order of the date of receipt of the application. An operator of a construction or business vehicle may apply for either a 30-day-per-job permit or a one-year letter permit. Only a year-round construction firm or a year-round business is eligible for a one-year letter permit and only as long as the firm or business remains in year-round operation. Notwithstanding possession of either a 30-day permit or a one-year letter permit, when water transportation is available, a firm or business shall accomplish all transportation of materials, supplies, and crews by use of the nearest available ferry, freight, or other overwater transportation method. When water transportation is available, vehicles permitted under a 30-day permit may remain at the job site but must be removed upon the completion of the job.</P>
          <P>(F) <E T="03">Municipal employees.</E> A year-round resident who is a full-time employee of one of the two villages or of one of the 15 unincorporated communities identified in the Act is eligible for a permit if such employment necessitates year-round Island residence. Five (5) municipal employee permits are available for each village or community except on the basis of documented community need.</P>
          <P>(G) <E T="03">Recreational vehicles.</E> Recreational vehicles may travel between Smith Point and Long Cove along the route described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. A total of 5000 one-way trips per year are available for the recreational vehicle category. Permits for recreational vehicles may be obtained from the Smith Point Visitor Center. Annual recreational vehicle trip counts commence in September of each year and conclude the following June or when the 5000 trip limit is reached, whichever occurs first.</P>
          <P>(9) <E T="03">Permit limitations.</E> (i) No permit issued under these regulations shall be valid for more than one year. The superintendent may issue permits for lesser periods, as appropriate for the travel required or the time of year at which a permit is issued.<PRTPAGE P="94"/>
          </P>
          <P>(ii) Permits for public utility, service, and official vehicles shall specify the number of vehicles and identify each vehicle whose use is authorized thereby. Permits for other motor vehicles will apply only to the single, specific vehicle for which issued.</P>
          <P>(iii) Permits are not transferable to another motor vehicle or to a new owner or lessee of the vehicle for which issued.</P>
          <P>(iv) Permits may specify a single or multiple uses or purposes for which travel on Seashore lands is permitted.

On weekend days in September and October, a recreational vehicle may enter the Island until 9:00 a.m. A recreational vehicle that has entered the Island may then remain or may depart but may not re-enter the Island until after 6:00 p.m.</P>
          <P>(iv) The Superintendent may, for situations where the restrictions in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) would create a severe hardship, authorize additional trips or travel at other hours.</P>
          <P>(v) In the case of public utility, service, and official vehicles for which permits have been issued, the Superintendent may authorize travel on Seashore lands at any time that he determines travel by such vehicles is essential, notwithstanding the above limitations and restrictions on authorized travel.</P>
          <P>(vi) Recurring travel conducted pursuant to paragraph (a)(10) (iv) or (v) of this section is authorized only pursuant to the terms and conditions of the original permit issued by the Superintendent; single occasion travel is authorized only pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit issued by the Superintendent on a case by case basis.</P>

          <P>(vii) In an emergency involving the protection of life or a threatened substantial loss of property, travel by a <PRTPAGE P="95"/>motor vehicle which is under permit is authorized at any time.</P>
          <P>(viii) The Superintendent may suspend any travel by motor vehicle otherwise permitted under this paragraph (a) when in his judgment such travel is inconsistent with the purpose of the Act or when such factors as weather, tides, or other physical conditions render travel hazardous or would endanger Seashore resources. Such suspension of travel shall be announced by the posting of appropriate signs or verbal order of the Superintendent.</P>
          <P>(ix) In accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1.5 of this chapter, the Superintendent may establish a limit on the number of motor vehicles permitted on any portion of, or the entirety of, the Seashore lands at any one time when such limits are required in the interests of public safety, protection of the resources of the area, or coordination with other visitor uses.</P>
          <P>(x) The provisions of this paragraph (a)(10) shall not apply to firefighting apparatus or to motor vehicles operated and owned or leased by a duly constituted law enforcement agency having jurisdiction within the Seashore.</P>
          <P>(11) <E T="03">Rules of travel.</E> (i) When two motor vehicles approach from opposite directions in the same track on Seashore lands, both operators shall reduce speed and the operator with the water to his left shall yield the right of way by turning out of the track to the right.</P>
          <P>(ii) No motor vehicle shall be operated on any portion of a dune on Seashore lands except at dune crossings.</P>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">Stock grazing.</E> (1) Privileges for the grazing of domestic livestock based on authorized use of certain areas at the time of approval of the Act of September 14, 1950 (64 Stat. 849, Pub. L. 787), shall continue in effect or shall be renewed from time to time, except for failure to comply with such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Superintendent in these regulations and after reasonable notice of default and subject to the following provisions of tenure:</P>
          <P>(i) Grazing privileges appurtenant to privately owned lands located within the park shall not be withdrawn until title to the lands to which such privileges are appurtenant shall have vested in the United States except for failure to comply with the regulations applicable thereto after reasonable notice of default.</P>
          <P>(ii) Grazing privileges appurtenant to privately owned lands located outside the park shall not be withdrawn for a period of twenty-five years after September 14, 1950, and thereafter shall continue during the lifetime of the original permittee and his heirs if they were members of his immediate family as described herein, except for failure to comply with the regulations applicable thereto after reasonable notice of default.</P>

          <P>(iii) Members of the immediate family are those persons who are related to and directly dependent upon a person or persons, living on or conducting grazing operations from lands, as of September 14, 1950, which the National <PRTPAGE P="100"/>Park Service recognized as base lands appurtenant to grazing privileges in the park. Such interpretation excludes mature children who, as of that date, were established in their own households and were not directly dependent upon the base lands and appurtenant grazing recognized by the National Park Service.</P>
          <P>(iv) If title to base lands lying outside the park is conveyed, or such base lands are leased to someone other than a member of the immediate family of the permittee as of September 14, 1950, the grazing preference shall be recognized only for a period of twenty-five years from September 14, 1950.</P>
          <P>(v) If title to a portion or part of the base land either outside or inside the park is conveyed or such base lands are leased, the new owner or lessee will take with the land so acquired or leased, such proportion of the entire grazing privileges as the grazing capacity in animal unit months of the tract conveyed or leased bears to the original area to which a grazing privilege was appurtenant and recognized. Conveyance or lease of all such base lands will automatically convey all grazing privileges appurtenant thereto.</P>
          <P>(vi) Grazing privileges which are appurtenant to base lands located either inside or outside the park shall not be conveyed separately therefrom.</P>
          <P>(2) Where no reasonable ingress or egress is available to permittees or nonpermittees who must cross Park lands to reach grazing allotments on non-Federal lands within the exterior boundary of the Park or adjacent thereto, the Superintendent will grant, upon request a temporary nonfee annual permit to herd stock on a designated driveway which shall specify the time to be consumed in each single drive. The breach of any of the terms or conditions of the permit shall be grounds for termination, suspension, or reduction of these privileges.</P>
          <P>(3) Grazing preferences are based on actual use during the period March 15, 1938 through September 14, 1950 and no increase in the number of animals or animal unit months will be allowed on Federal lands in the park.</P>
          <P>(4)(i) A permittee whose grazing privilege is appurtenant to privately owned lands within the park will be granted total nonuse or reduced benefits for one or more years without nullifying his privilege in subsequent years.</P>
          <P>(ii) A permittee whose privilege is appurtenant to base lands outside the park may be granted total nonuse on a year to year basis not to exceed three consecutive years. Total nonuse beyond this time may be granted if necessitated for reasons clearly outside the control of the permittee. Total unauthorized nonuse beyond three consecutive years will result in the termination and loss of all grazing privileges.</P>
          <P>(iii) Whenever partial or total non-use is desired, an application must be made in writing to the Superintendent.</P>
          <P>(5) Grazing fees shall be the same as those approved for the Teton National Forest and will be adjusted accordingly.</P>

          <P>(7) The Superintendent may accept a written relinquishment or waiver of any privileges; however, no such relinquishment or waiver will be effective without the written consent of the owner or owners of the base lands.</P>
          <P>(8) Permits. Terms and conditions. The issuance and continued effectiveness of all permits will be subject, in addition to mandatory provisions required by Executive Order or law, to the following terms and conditions:</P>
          <P>(i) The permittee and his employees shall use all possible care in preventing forest and range fires, and shall assist in the extinguishing of forest and range fires on, or within, the vicinity of the land described in the permit, as well as in the preservation of good order within the boundaries of the park.</P>
          <P>(ii) The Superintendent may require the permittee before driving livestock to or from the grazing allotment to gather his livestock at a designated time and place for the purpose of counting the same.</P>

          </P>
          <P>(iv) The permittee shall file with the Superintendent a copy of his stock brand or other mark.</P>
          <P>(v) The permittee shall, upon notice from the Superintendent that the allotment designated in the permit is not ready to be grazed at the beginning of the designated grazing season, place no livestock on the allotment for such a period as may be determined by the Superintendent as necessary to avoid damage to the range. All, or a portion of the livestock shall be removed from the area before the expiration of the designated grazing season if the Superintendent determines further grazing would be detrimental to the range. The number of stock and the grazing period may be adjusted by the Superintendent at any time when such action is deemed necessary for the protection of the range.</P>
          <P>(vi) No permit shall be issued or renewed until payment of all fees and other amounts due the National Park Service has been made. Fees for permits are due the National Park Service and must be paid at least 15 days in advance of the grazing period. No permit shall be effective to authorize grazing use thereunder until all fees and other amounts due the National Park Service have been paid. A pro rata adjustment of fees will be made in the event of reduction of grazing privileges granted in the permit, except that not more than 50 percent of the total annual grazing fee will be refunded in the event reduced grazing benefits are taken at the election of the permittee after his stock are on the range.</P>
          <P>(vii) No building or other structure shall be erected nor shall physical improvements of any kind be established under the permit except upon plans and specifications approved by the National Park Service. Any such facilities, structures, or buildings may be removed or disposed of to a successor permittee within three months following the termination of the permit; otherwise they shall become the property of the United States without compensation therefor.</P>
          <P>(viii) The permittee shall utilize the lands covered by the permit in a manner approved and directed by the Superintendent which will prevent soil erosion thereon and on lands adjoining same.</P>
          <P>(ix) The right is reserved to adjust the fees specified in the permit at any time to conform with the fees approved for Teton National Forest, and the permittee shall be furnished a notice of any change of fees.</P>
          <P>(x) All livestock are considered as mature animals at six months of age and are so counted in determining animal unit months and numbers of animals.</P>
          <P>(xi) The Superintendent may prescribe additional terms and conditions to meet individual cases.</P>
          <P>(9) The breach of any of the terms or conditions of the permit shall be grounds for termination, suspension, or reduction of grazing privileges.</P>
          <P>(10) Appeals from the decision of the Superintendent to the Regional Director and from the Regional Director to the Director shall be made in accordance with the National Park Service Order No. 14, as amended (19 FR 8824) and Regional Director, Order No. 3, as amended (21 FR 1494).</P>
          <P>(11) Nothing in these regulations shall be construed as to prevent the enforcement of the provisions of the general rules and regulations and the special rules and regulations of the National Park Service or of any other provisions of said rules and regulations applicable to stock grazing.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Camping.</E> (1) No person, party, or organization shall be permitted to camp more than 30 days in a calendar year in designated sites within the Park.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Hunting.</E> (1) Lands within the Seashore on which hunting is legally permitted are designated as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) Ocracoke Island, except Ocracoke village.</P>
          <P>(ii) Hatteras Island, 500 acres, in three disconnected strips 250 feet wide measuring eastward from mean high water mark on Pamlico Sound between villages of Salvo and Avon and Buxton, and between Frisco and Hatteras.</P>

          <P>(2) Seashore lands on which hunting is not permitted will be posted accordingly.</P>
          <P>(3) This hunting plan will be administered and enforced by the National Park Service, through the Service's authorized local representative, the Superintendent of the Seashore, hereinafter referred to as the Superintendent.</P>
          <P>(4) The State of North Carolina will assist in the enforcement of applicable State and Federal hunting laws and otherwise in carrying out this plan.</P>
          <P>(5) Hunting will be restricted to waterfowl. Season length, opening and closing dates, bag limits and species of waterfowl which may be taken will be in accordance with the rules and regulations issued by the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</P>

          <P>(7) Permanent blinds will be constructed exclusively by the Seashore and these will be built only on Bodie Island. Setting up and use of temporary or portable blinds by hunters will be permitted on Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands.</P>
          <P>(8) Minimum distance between blinds on Seashore land and ponds within the designated hunting areas will be 300 yards unless other conditions, such as natural screening, justify a shorter distance.</P>
          <P>(9) Hunting on Ocracoke Island will be permitted and managed in the same manner as Hatteras Island.</P>
          <P>(10) “Jump shooting” of waterfowl will be permitted only on Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands and is prohibited within 300 yards of any blind.</P>
          <P>(11) Properly licensed and authorized guides may provide hunting guide service within the designated hunting areas in the Seashore. They will not be permitted to solicit business within the boundaries of the Seashore and all arrangements with hunters must be made outside of those boundaries. Guides will be required to possess a North Carolina State guide license and to fulfill all requirements and conditions imposed by that license. Fees charged by guides must be approved in advance by the Superintendent. Each guide must also possess a permit issued by the Superintendent which authorizes him to guide hunters within the Seashore and the amount of the fees which he may charge.</P>
          <P>(12) Guides shall have no permanent or seasonal blind rights within the Seashore and no special privileges other than those specified in this section.</P>
          <P>(13) At 5:00 a.m. each morning the day of hunting a drawing for blind assignments will be conducted at the check-out station. Advance reservations for permission to draw will be accepted through the United States mail only. Reservations postmarked prior to 12:01 a.m. of September 25 will not be accepted. The postmark date and hour will establish and govern the priority of drawing. Maximum reservation by any person shall be three (3) consecutive days in any week, Monday through Saturday, and limited to a total of six (6) days during the season. Reservations shall have priority over nonreservations at drawing time. In the event a reservation is to be canceled, the Superintendent shall be informed by the party prior to drawing time for the date or dates of the reservation.</P>

          <P>(14) The first departure from a blind by a person terminates his hunting privilege within Bodie Island for that day and the blinds may be reassigned by the Superintendent, Cape Hatteras National Seashore Recreational Area, or his duly authorized representative, for use by others later the same day. <PRTPAGE P="135"/>Vacating parties must check out and furnish information regarding their take at the checking station on Bodie Island located near the north boundary of the hunting area.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Commercial hauling.</E> Ranchers and stockmen owning, leasing or renting private lands, or holding grazing permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management on designated grazing allotments adjacent to the Artesia Entrance Road, Blue Mountain Road, and Deerlodge Park Road, are authorized to use these roads for trucking or hauling ranching and agricultural supplies and materials, including livestock, for use in normal ranching and stock growing operations.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Stock grazing.</E> (1) Privileges for the grazing of domestic livestock based on authorized use of certain areas at the time of approval of the act of September 8, 1960 (74 Stat. 857, Pub. L. 86-729), shall continue in effect or shall be renewed from time to time, except for failure to comply with such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Superintendent in these regulations and after reasonable notice of default and subject to the following provisions of tenure:</P>
          <P>(i) Grazing privileges appurtenant to privately owned lands located within the Monument shall not be withdrawn until title to the lands to which such privileges are appurtenant shall have vested in the United States except for failure to comply with the regulations applicable thereto after reasonable notice of default.</P>
          <P>(ii) Grazing privileges appurtenant to privately owned lands located outside the Monument shall not be withdrawn for a period of twenty-five years after September 8, 1960, and thereafter shall continue during the lifetime of the original permittee and his heirs if they were members of his immediate family as described herein except for failure to comply with the regulations applicable thereto after reasonable notice of default.</P>

          <P>(iii) Members of the immediate family are those persons who are related to and directly dependent upon a person or persons, living on or conducting <PRTPAGE P="141"/>grazing operations from lands, as of September 8, 1960, which the National Park Service recognized as base lands appurtenant to grazing privileges in the monument. Such interpretation excludes mature children who, as of that date, were established in their own households and were not directly dependent upon the base lands and appurtenant grazing recognized by the National Park Service.</P>
          <P>(iv) If title to base lands lying outside the monument is conveyed, or such base lands are leased to someone other than a member of the immediate family of the permittee as of September 8, 1960, the grazing preference shall be recognized only for a period of twenty-five years from September 8, 1960.</P>
          <P>(v) If title to a portion or part of the base land either outside or inside the monument is conveyed or such base lands are leased, the new owner or lessee will take with the land so acquired or leased after September 8, 1960, such proportion of the entire grazing privileges as the grazing capacity in animal unit months of the tract conveyed or leased bears to the original area to which a grazing privilege was appurtenant and recognized. Conveyance or lease of all such base lands will automatically convey all grazing privileges appurtenant thereto.</P>
          <P>(vi) Grazing privileges which are appurtenant to base lands located either inside or outside the monument as of September 8, 1960, shall not be conveyed separately therefrom.</P>
          <P>(2) Where no reasonable ingress or egress is available to permittees or nonpermittees who must cross monument lands to reach grazing allotments or non-Federal lands within the exterior boundary of the monument or adjacent thereto, the Superintendent will grant, upon request, a temporary nonfee annual permit to herd stock on a designated driveway which shall specify the time to be consumed in each single drive.</P>
          <P>(3) After September 8, 1960, no increase in the number of animal unit months will be allowed on Federal lands in the monument.</P>
          <P>(4)(i) A permittee whose privileges are appurtenant to base lands either inside or outside the monument may be granted total nonuse on a year to year basis not to exceed three consecutive years. Total nonuse beyond this time may be granted if necessitated for reasons clearly outside the control of the permittee. Total unauthorized nonuse beyond three consecutive years will result in the termination and loss of all grazing privileges.</P>
          <P>(ii) Whenever partial or total non-use is desired an application must be made in writing to the Superintendent.</P>
          <P>(5) Grazing fees shall be the same as those approved for the Bureau of Land Management and will be adjusted accordingly.</P>
          <P>(6) Permittees or nonpermittees who have stock on Federal lands within the monument at any time or place, when or where herding or grazing is unauthorized may be assessed fifty cents per day per cow or horse and ten cents per day per sheep as damages.</P>
          <P>(7) The Superintendent may accept a written relinquishment or waiver of any privileges; however, no such relinquishment or waiver will be effective without the written consent of the owner or owners of the base lands.</P>
          <P>(8) Permits. Terms and conditions. The issuance and continued effectiveness of all permits will be subject, in addition to mandatory provisions required by Executive Order or law, to the following terms and conditions:</P>
          <P>(i) The permittee and his employees shall use all possible care in preventing forest and range fires, and shall assist in the extinguishing of forest and range fires on, or within, the vicinity of the land described in the permit, as well as in the preservation of good order within the boundaries of the Monument.</P>
          <P>(ii) The Superintendent may require the permittee before driving livestock to or from the grazing allotment to gather his livestock at a designated time and place for the purpose of counting the same.</P>
          <P>(iii) Stock will be allowed to graze only on the allotment designated in the permit.</P>
          <P>(iv) The permittee shall file with the Superintendent a copy of his stock brand or other mark.</P>

          <P>(v) The permittee shall, upon notice from the Superintendent that the allotment designated in the permit is not ready to be grazed at the beginning of <PRTPAGE P="142"/>the designated grazing season, place no livestock on the allotment for such a period as may be determined by the Superintendent as necessary to avoid damage to the range. All, or a portion of the livestock shall be removed from the area before the expiration of the designated grazing season if the Superintendent determines further grazing would be detrimental to the range. The number of stock and the grazing period may be adjusted by the Superintendent at any time when such action is deemed necessary for the protection of the range.</P>
          <P>(vi) No permit shall be issued or renewed until payment of all fees and other amounts due the National Park Service has been made. Fees for permits are due the National Park Service and must be paid at least 15 days in advance of the grazing period. No permit shall be effective to authorize grazing use thereunder until all fees and other amounts due the National Park Service have been paid. A pro rata adjustment of fees will be made in the event of reduction of grazing privileges granted in the permit, except that not more than 50 percent of the total annual grazing fee will be refunded in the event reduced grazing benefits are taken at the election of the permittee after his stock are on the range.</P>
          <P>(vii) No building or other structure shall be erected nor shall physical improvements of any kind be established under the permit except upon plans and specifications approved by the National Park Service. Any such facilities, structures, or buildings may be removed or disposed of to a successor permittee within three months following the termination of the permit; otherwise they shall become the property of the United States without compensation therefor.</P>
          <P>(viii) The permittee shall utilize the lands covered by the permit in a manner approved and directed by the Superintendent which will prevent soil erosion thereon and on lands adjoining same.</P>
          <P>(ix) The right is reserved to adjust the fees specified in the permit at any time to conform with the fees approved for the Bureau of Land Management, and the permittee shall be furnished a notice of any change of fees.</P>
          <P>(x) All livestock are considered as mature animals at 6 months of age and are so counted in determining animal unit months and numbers of animals.</P>
          <P>(xi) The Superintendent may prescribe additional terms and conditions to meet individual cases.</P>
          <P>(9) The breach of any of the terms or conditions of the permit shall be grounds for termination, suspension, or reduction of grazing privileges.</P>
          <P>(10) Appeals from the decision of the Superintendent to the Regional Director, and from the Regional Director to the Director shall be made in accordance with National Park Service Order No. 14, as amended (19 FR 8824) and Regional Director, Order No. 3, as amended (21 FR 1494).</P>
          <P>(11) Nothing in these regulations shall be construed as to prevent the enforcement of the provisions of the General Rules and Regulations and the Special Rules and Regulations of the National Park Service or of any other provisions of said rules and regulations applicable to stock grazing.</P>

          <P>(B) It reasonably appears that the proposed demonstration or special event will present a clear and present danger to the public safety, good order, or health.</P>
          <P>(C) The proposed demonstration or special event is of such a nature or duration that it cannot reasonably be accommodated in the particular area applied for; in that event, the Regional Director shall propose an alternate site to the applicant, if available for the activity; in this connection, the Regional Director shall reasonably take into account possible damage to the park, including trees, shrubbery, other plantings, park installations and statues.</P>
          <P>(D) The application proposes activities contrary to any of the provisions of this section or other applicable law or regulation.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Permit limitations.</E> Issuance of a permit is subject to the following limitations:</P>
          <P>(i) No more than 750 persons are permitted to conduct a demonstration on the White House sidewalk at any one time.</P>
          <P>(ii) No more than 3,000 persons are permitted to conduct a demonstration in Lafayette Park at any one time.</P>
          <P>(A) The Regional Director may waive the 3,000 person limitation for Lafayette Park and/or the 750 person limitation for the White House Sidewalk upon a showing by the applicant that good faith efforts will be made to plan and marshal the demonstration in such a fashion so as to render unlikely any substantial risk of unreasonable disruption or violence.</P>
          <P>(B) In making a waiver determination, the Regional Director shall consider and the applicant shall furnish at least ten days in advance of the proposed demonstration, the functions the marshals will perform, the means by which they will be identified, and their method of communication with each other and the crowd. This requirement will be satisfied by completion and submission of the same form referred to in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</P>

          <P>(iii) No permit will be issued for a demonstration on the White House <PRTPAGE P="180"/>Sidewalk and in Lafayette Park at the same time except when the organization, group, or other sponsor of such demonstration undertakes in good faith all reasonable action, including the provision of sufficient marshals, to insure good order and self-discipline in conducting such demonstration and any necessary movement of persons, so that the numerical limitations and waiver provisions described in paragraphs (g)(5) (i) and (ii) of this section are observed.</P>
          <P>(iv) The Regional Director may restrict demonstrations and special events weekdays (except holidays) between the hours of 7:00 to 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 to 6:30 p.m. if it reasonably appears necessary to avoid unreasonable interference with rush-hour traffic.</P>
          <P>(v) Special events are not permitted unless approved by the Regional Director. In determining whether to approve a proposed special event, the Regional Director shall consider and base the determination upon the following criteria:</P>
          <P>(A) Whether the objectives and purposes of the proposed special event relate to and are within the basic mission and responsibilities of the National Capital Region, National Park Service.</P>
          <P>(B) Whether the park area requested is reasonably suited in terms of accessibility, size, and nature of the proposed special event.</P>
          <P>(C) Whether the proposed special event can be permitted within a reasonable budgetary allocation of National Park Service funds considering the event's public appeal, and the anticipated participation of the general public therein.</P>
          <P>(D) Whether the proposed event is duplicative of events previously offered in National Capital Region or elsewhere in or about Washington, DC.</P>
          <P>(E) Whether the activities contemplated for the proposed special event are in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations.</P>
          <P>(vi) In connection with permitted demonstrations or special events, temporary structures may be erected for the purpose of symbolizing a message or meeting logistical needs such as first aid facilities, lost children areas or the provision of shelter for electrical and other sensitive equipment or displays. Temporary structures may not be used outside designated camping areas for living accommodation activities such as sleeping, or making preparations to sleep (including the laying down of bedding for the purpose of sleeping), or storing personal belongings, or making any fire, or doing any digging or earth breaking or carrying on cooking activities. The above-listed activities constitute camping when it reasonably appears, in light of all the circumstances, that the participants, in conducting these activities, are in fact using the area as a living accommodation regardless of the intent of the participants or the nature of any other activities in which they may also be engaging. Temporary structures are permitted to the extent described above, provided prior notice has been given to the Regional Director, except that:</P>
          <P>(A) Structures are not permitted on the White House sidewalk.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Surface disturbance moratorium.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) For a period of four years after September 28, 1976, no operator of a claim located within the boundaries of Death Valley National Monument, Mount McKinley National Park, or Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument (see also claims subject to § 9.10(a)(3)) shall disturb for purposes of mineral exploration or development the surface of any lands which had not been significantly disturbed for purposes of mineral extraction prior to February <PRTPAGE P="191"/>29, 1976, except as provided in this section. However, where a claim is subject, for a peroid of four years after September 28, 1976, to this section solely by virtue of § 9.10(a)(3), the date before which there must have been significant disturbance for purposes of mineral extraction is January 26, 1977.</P>
            <P>(b) An operator of a claim in one of these units seeking to enlarge an existing excavation or otherwise disturb the surface for purposes of mineral exploration or development shall file with the Superintendent an application stating his need to disturb additional surface in order to maintain production at an annual rate not to exceed an average annual production level of said operations for the three calendar years 1973, 1974, and 1975. Accompanying the application shall be a plan of operations which complies with § 9.9 and verified copies of production records for the years 1973, 1974, and 1975.</P>
            <P>(c) If the Regional Director finds that the submitted plan of operations complies with § 9.9, that enlargement of the existing excavation of an individual mining operation is necessary in order to make feasible continued production therefrom at an annual rate not to exceed the average annual production level of said operation for the three calendar years 1973, 1974, and 1975, and that the plan of operations meets the applicable standard of approval of § 9.10(a)(1), he shall issue a permit allowing the disturbance of the surface of the lands contiguous to the existing excavation to the minimum extent necessary to effect such enlargement. For the purpose of this section “lands contiguous to the existing excavation” shall include land which actually adjoins the existing excavation or which could logically become an extension of the excavation; for example, drilling to determine the extent and direction to which the existing excavation should be extended may be permitted at a site which does not actually adjoin the excavating.</P>
            <P>(d) The appropriate reclamation standard to be applied will be determined by the nature of the claim. (See §§ 9.11(a)(1) and (a)(2).)</P>
            <P>(e) Operations conducted under a permit pursuant to this section shall be subject to all the limitations imposed by this part.</P>
            <P>(f) For the purposes of this section, each separate mining excavation shall be treated as an individual mining operation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Recordation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Any unpatented mining claim in a unit in existence on September 28, 1976, which was not recorded on or before September 28, 1977, in accordance with the Notice of October 20, 1976 (41 FR 46357) or 36 CFR 9.5 as promulgated on January 26, 1977, is, pursuant to section 8 of the Act, conclusively presumed to be abandoned and shall be void.</P>
            <P>(b) Any unpatented mining claim in a unit established after September 28, 1976, or in an area added to an existing unit after that date, shall be recorded with the Bureau of Land Management in accordance with the provisions of section 314 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), 90 Stat. 2769, 43 U.S.C. 1744, and regulations implementing it (43 CFR 3833.1).</P>
            <P>(c) A claimant of an unpatented mining claim in any unit must file annually with the Bureau of Land Management a notice of intention to hold a claim or evidence of annual assessment work required by section 314 of FLPMA, as implemented by 43 CFR 3833.2. A copy of each such filing will be provided to the Superintendent of the appropriate unit by the Bureau of Land Management.</P>
            <P>(d) The effect of failure to file the instruments required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be controlled by 43 CFR 3833.4. Recordation or filing under this section shall not render any claim valid which would not otherwise be valid under applicable law and shall not give the claimant any rights to which he is not otherwise entitled by law.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Transfers of interest.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Whenever a claimant who has recorded his unpatented claim(s) with <PRTPAGE P="192"/>the Superintendent pursuant to the requirements of § 9.5 sells, assigns, bequeaths, or otherwise conveys all or any part of his interest in his claim(s), the Superintendent shall be notified within 60 days after completion of the transfer of: The name of the claim(s) involved; the name and legal address of the person to whom an interest has been sold, assigned, bequeathed, or otherwise transferred; and a description of the interest conveyed or received. Copies of the transfer documents will be provided by the Superintendent to the Bureau of Land Management. Failure to so notify the Superintendent shall render any existing access permit void.</P>
            <P>(b) If the transfer occurs within the period of 12 months from the effective date of the Act and the prior owner has not recorded the unpatented claim with the Superintendent in accordance with these regulations, the holder by transfer shall have the remainder of the 12-month period to record the unpatented claim.

            <SUBJECT>Assessment work.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An access permit and approved plan of operations must be obtained by a claimant prior to the performance of any assessment work required by Revised Statute 2324 (30 U.S.C. 28) on a claim in a unit.</P>
            <P>(b) Permits will be issued in accordance with the following:</P>
            <P>(1) In units subject to the surface disturbance moratorium of section 4 of the Act and § 9.4, no access permits will be granted for the purpose of performing assessment work.</P>
            <P>(2) It has been determined that in all other units the Secretary will not challenge the validity of any unpatented claim within a unit for the failure to do assessment work during or after the assessment year commencing September 1, 1976. The Secretary expressly reserves, however, the existing right to contest claims for failure to do such work in the past. No access permits will be granted solely for the purpose of performing assessment work in these units except where claimant establishes the legal necessity for such permit in order to perform work necessary to take the claim to patent, and has filed and had approved a plan of operations as provided by these regulations. (For exploratory or development type work, see § 9.9.)</P>

            <SUBJECT>Use of water.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) No operator may use for operations any water from a point of diversion which is within the boundaries of any unit unless authorized in writing by the Regional Director. The Regional Director shall not approve a plan of operations requiring the use of water from such source unless the right to the water has been perfected under applicable State law, has a priority date prior to the establishment of the unit and there has been a continued beneficial use of that water right.</P>
            <P>(b) If an operator whose operations will require the use of water from a point of diversion within the boundaries of the unit can show that he has a perfected State water right junior to the reserved water right of the United States and can demonstrate that the exercise of that State water right will not diminish the Federal right, which is that amount of water necessary for the purposes for which the unit was established, he will be authorized to use water from that source for operations, if he has complied with all other provisions of these regulations.</P>

            <P>(5) The nature and extent of the known deposit to be mined. When the claim is located in a National Monument in Alaska and is unpatented, a completed Supplemental Claim Information Statement shall be submitted describing the quantity, quality, and any previous production of the deposit;</P>
            <P>(6) A mining reclamation plan demonstrating compliance with the requirements of § 9.11;</P>
            <P>(7) All steps taken to comply with any applicable Federal, State, and local laws or regulations, including the applicable regulations in 36 CFR, chapter I;</P>
            <P>(8) In units subject to the surface disturbance moratorium of section 4 of the Act and § 9.4, proof satisfactory to the Regional Director that the surface of the area on which the operation is to occur was significantly disturbed for purposes of mineral extraction prior to February 29, 1976, or if the area was not so disturbed, proof, including production records for the years 1973, 1974, and 1975, that new disturbance is necessary to maintain an average annual rate of production not to exceed that of the years 1973, 1974, and 1975;</P>
            <P>(9) An environmental report analyzing the following:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Plan of operations approval.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Regional Director shall not approve a plan of operations:</P>
            <P>(1) For existing or new operations if the claim was patented without surface use restriction, where the operations would constitute a nuisance in the vicinity of the operation, or would significantly injure or adversely affect federally owned lands; or</P>
            <P>(2) For operations which had not significantly disturbed the surface of the claim for purposes of mineral extraction prior to January 26, 1977, if the claim has not been patented, or if the patent is subject to surface use restrictions, where the operations would preclude management for the purpose of preserving the pristine beauty of the unit for present and future generations, or would adversely affect or significantly injure the ecological or cultural resources of the unit. No new surface mining will be permitted under this paragraph except under this standard; or</P>

            <P>(3) For operations which had significantly disturbed the surface of the claim for purposes of mineral extraction prior to January 26, 1977, if the claim has not been taken to patent, or <PRTPAGE P="194"/>the patent is subject to surface use restrictions, where the operations would constitute a nuisance in the vicinity of the operation, or would significantly injure or adversely affect federally owned lands. Provided, however, operations under this paragraph shall be limited by the provisions of § 9.4, notwithstanding the limitation of that section's applicability to the three enumerated units;</P>
            <P>(4) Where the claim, regardless of when it was located, has not been patented and the operations would result in the destruction of surface resources, such as trees, vegetation, soil, water resources, or loss of wildlife habitat, not required for development of the claim; or</P>
            <P>(5) Where the operations would constitute a violation of the surface disturbance moratorium of section 4 of the Act; or</P>
            <P>(6) Where the plan does not satisfy each of the requirements of § 9.9.</P>
            <P>(b) Within 60 days of the receipt of a proposed plan of operations, the Regional Director shall make an environmental analysis of such plan, and</P>
            <P>(1) Notify the operator that he has approved or rejected the plan of operations; or</P>
            <P>(2) Notify the operator of any changes in, or additions to the plan of operations which are necessary before such plan will be approved; or</P>

            <P>(3) Notify the operator that the plan is being reviewed, but that more time, not to exceed an additional 30 days, is necessary to complete such review, and setting forth the reasons why additional time is required; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That days during which the area of operations is inaccessible for such reasons as inclement weather, natural catastrophy, etc., for inspection shall not be included when computing either this time period, or that in paragraph (b) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(4) Notify the operator that the plan cannot be considered for approval until forty-five (45) days after a final environmental impact statement, if required, has been prepared and filed with the Council on Environmental Quality.</P>
            <P>(c) Failure of the Regional Director to act on a proposed plan of operations and related permits within the time period specified shall constitute an approval of the plan and related permits for a period of three (3) years.</P>
            <P>(d) The Regional Director's analysis may include:</P>
            <P>(1) An examination of the environmental report filed by the operator;</P>
            <P>(2) An evaluation of measures and timing required to comply with reclamation requirements;</P>
            <P>(3) An evaluation of necessary conditions and amount of the bond or security deposit to cover estimated reclamation costs;</P>
            <P>(4) An evaluation of the need for any additional requirements in access permit; and</P>
            <P>(5) A determination regarding the impact of this operation and the cumulative impact of all operations on the management of the unit.</P>
            <P>(e) Prior to approval of a plan of operations, the Regional Director shall determine whether any properties included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places or National Registry of Natural Landmarks may be affected by the proposed activity. This determination will require the acquisition of adequate information, such as that resulting from field surveys, in order to properly determine the presence of and significance of cultural resources within the area to be affected by mining operations. Whenever National Register properties or properties eligible for inclusion in the National Register would be affected by mining operations, the Regional Director shall comply with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as implemented by 36 CFR part 800.</P>
            <P>(1) The operator shall not injure, alter, destroy, or collect any site, structure, object, or other value of historical, archeological, or other cultural scientific importance. Failure to comply with this requirement shall constitute a violation of the Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431-433) (see 43 CFR part 3).</P>

            <P>(2) The operator shall immediately bring to the attention of the Superintendent any cultural and/or scientific resource that might be altered or destroyed by his operation and shall leave such discovery intact until told to proceed by the Superintendent. The <PRTPAGE P="195"/>Superintendent will evaluate the discoveries brought to his attention, and will determine within ten (10) working days what action will be taken with respect to such discoveries.</P>
            <P>(3) The responsibility for, and cost of investigations and salvage of such values that are discovered during operations will be that of the operator, where the claim is unpatented.</P>
            <P>(f) The operator shall protect all survey monuments, witness corners, reference monuments and bearing trees against destruction, obliteration, or damage from mining operations, and shall be responsible for the reestablishment, restoration, or referencing of any monuments, corners and bearing trees which are destroyed, obliterated, or damaged by such mining operations.</P>
            <P>(g) Pending approval of the plan of operations, the Regional Director may approve, on a temporary basis, the continuation of existing operations if necessary to enable timely compliance with these regulations and with Federal, State, or local laws, or if a halt to existing operations would result in an unreasonable economic burden or injury to the operator. Such work must be conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, and in a manner prescribed by the Regional Director and designed to minimize or prevent significant environmental effects.</P>
            <P>(h) Approval of each plan of operations is expressly conditioned upon the Superintendent having such reasonable access to the claim as is necessary to properly monitor and insure compliance with the plan of operations.</P>

            <P>(1) Where the claim was patented without surface use restriction, the operator shall at a minimum:</P>
            <P>(i) Remove all above ground structures, equipment, and other manmade debris used for operations; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Rehabilitate the area of operations to a condition which would not constitute a nuisance; or would not adversely affect, injure or damage, federally owned lands.</P>
            <P>(2) On any claim which was patented with surface use restrictions or is unpatented, each operator must take steps to restore natural conditions and processes, which steps shall include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Removing all above ground structures, equipment and other manmade debris;</P>
            <P>(ii) Providing for the prevention of surface subsidence;</P>
            <P>(iii) Replacing overburden and spoil, wherever economically and technologically practicable;</P>
            <P>(iv) Grading to reasonably conform the contour of the area of operations to a contour similar to that which existed prior to the initiation of operations, where such grading will not jeopardize reclamation;</P>
            <P>(v) Replacing the natural topsoil necessary for vegetative restoration; and</P>
            <P>(vi) Reestablishing native vegetative communities.</P>
            <P>(b) Reclamation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is unacceptable unless it provides for the safe movement of native wildlife, the reestablishment of native vegetative communities, the normal flow of surface and reasonable flow of subsurface waters, the return of the area to a condition which does not jeopardize visitor safety or public use of the unit, and return of the area to a condition equivalent to its pristine beauty.</P>
            <P>(c) Reclamation required by this section shall apply to operations authorized under this part, except that all terms relating to reclamation of previously issued special use permits revoked by this part for operations to be continued under an approved plan of operations shall be incorporated into the operator's reclamation plans.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the purpose and scope of this subpart?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The purpose of this subpart is to ensure that operators exercising non-federal oil and gas rights within a System unit outside of Alaska use technologically feasible, least damaging methods to:</P>
              <P>(1) Protect federally owned or administered lands, waters, or resources of System units;</P>
              <P>(2) Protect NPS visitor uses or experiences, or visitor or employee health and safety; and</P>
              <P>(3) Protect park resources and values under the statute commonly known as the NPS Organic Act;</P>
              <P>(b) This subpart applies to all operators conducting non-federal oil or gas operations on lands or waters within System units outside of Alaska, regardless of the ownership or legislative jurisdiction status of those lands or waters.</P>
              <P>(c) We do not intend for this subpart to result in a taking of a property interest. Application of this subpart is intended to reasonably regulate operations within System units that may affect federally owned or administered lands, waters, and resources, visitor uses and experiences, and visitor and employee health and safety.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When does this subpart apply to me?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This subpart applies to you if you are an operator who conducts or proposes to conduct non-federal oil or gas operations outside of Alaska.</P>
              <P>(b) If you were operating outside of a System unit and your operation has been included within an existing System unit as a result of a change to the boundary, or included within a newly established System unit, you are subject to §§ 9.50 through 9.53.</P>
              <P>(c) If you were operating under an exemption because your operation accessed oil and gas rights inside the System unit boundary from a surface location outside the boundary, and your surface location has been included within an existing System unit as a result of a change to the boundary, or included within a newly established System unit, you are subject to §§ 9.50 through 9.53.</P>

              <P>(a) If you already have an NPS-approved plan of operations, you may continue to operate according to the terms and conditions of that approval, subject to the provisions of this subpart. For purposes of this subpart, we consider your approved plan of operations to be either a temporary access permit or operations permit.</P>
              <P>(b) This section applies to you if we have granted you an exemption to the plan of operations requirement because your operation accesses oil and gas rights inside a System unit boundary from a surface location outside the boundary. You may continue to operate under the exemption provided that your operations comply with the general terms and conditions of §§ 9.120 through 9.122. You are also subject to the prohibitions and penalties in §§ 9.180 through 9.182.</P>

              <P>(a) You must comply with all operating standards in §§ 9.111 through 9.116, as well as with the standards in §§ 9.117 and 9.118, if applicable. The standards apply only to operations that occur within a System unit, including downhole activities, and do not apply to surface activities located outside a System unit. These operating standards are incorporated into the terms and conditions of your operations permit. Violation of these operating standards will subject you to the prohibitions and penalties provisions of §§ 9.180 through 9.182.</P>
              <P>(b) NPS operating standards are applied to ensure protection of federally owned or administered lands, waters, and resources of System units, visitor uses and experiences, and visitor and employee health and safety. The operating standards give us and the operator flexibility to consider using alternative methods, equipment, materials design, and conduct of operations.</P>
              <P>(c) In applying standards to a particular operation, you must use technologically feasible, least damaging methods to protect federally owned or administered lands, waters, and resources of System units, visitor uses and experiences, and visitor and employee health and safety.</P>

              <P>(a) Interested parties may view the publicly available documents at the Superintendent's office during normal business hours or by other means prescribed by the Superintendent. The availability for public inspection of information about the nature, location, character, or ownership of park resources will conform to all applicable law and implementing regulations, standards, and guidelines.<PRTPAGE P="218"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The Superintendent will make available for public inspection any documents that an operator submits to the NPS under this subpart except those that you have identified as proprietary or confidential.</P>
              <P>(c) For the information required in §§ 9.88, 9.89, and 9.122, the operator and the submitter of the information will be deemed to have waived any right to protect from public disclosure information submitted to the NPS. For information required under §§ 9.88, 9.89, and 9.122 that the owner of the information claims to be exempt from public disclosure and is withheld from the NPS, a corporate officer, managing partner, or sole proprietor of the operator must sign and the operator must submit to the Superintendent an affidavit that:</P>
              <P>(1) Identifies the owner of the withheld information and provides the name, address and contact information for a corporate officer, managing partner, or sole proprietor of the owner of the information;</P>
              <P>(2) Identifies the Federal statute or regulation that would prohibit the NPS from publicly disclosing the information if it were in the NPS's possession;</P>
              <P>(3) Affirms that the operator has been provided the withheld information from the owner of the information and is maintaining records of the withheld information, or that the operator has access and will maintain access to the withheld information held by the owner of the information;</P>
              <P>(4) Affirms that the information is not publicly available;</P>
              <P>(5) Affirms that the information is not required to be publicly disclosed under any applicable local, State, tribal, or Federal law;</P>
              <P>(6) Affirms that the owner of the information is in actual competition and identifies competitors or others that could use the withheld information to cause the owner of the information substantial competitive harm;</P>
              <P>(7) Affirms that the release of the information would likely cause substantial competitive harm to the owner of the information and provides the factual basis for that affirmation; and</P>
              <P>(8) Affirms that the information is not readily apparent through reverse engineering with publicly available information.</P>
              <P>(d) If the operator relies upon information from third parties, such as the owner of the withheld information, to make the affirmations in paragraphs (c)(6) through (8) of this section, the operator must provide a written affidavit from the third party that sets forth the relied-upon information.</P>
              <P>(e) The NPS may require any operator to submit to the NPS any withheld information, and any information relevant to a claim that withheld information is exempt from public disclosure.</P>
              <P>(f) If the NPS determines that the information submitted under paragraph (e) of this section is not exempt from disclosure, the NPS will make the information available to the public after providing the operator and owner of the information with no fewer than 10 business days' notice of the NPS's determination.</P>
              <P>(g) The operator must maintain records of the withheld information until the later of the NPS's release of the operator's financial assurance or 7 years after completion of hydraulic fracturing operations. Any subsequent operator will be responsible for maintaining access to records required by this paragraph during its operation of the well. The operator will be deemed to be maintaining the records if it can promptly provide the complete and accurate information to NPS, even if the information is in the custody of its owner.</P>
              <P>(h) If any of the chemical identity information required in § 9.122 is withheld, the operator must provide the generic chemical name in the submission required by § 9.122. The generic chemical name must be only as nonspecific as is necessary to protect the confidential chemical identity, and should be the same as or no less descriptive than the generic chemical name provided to the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Rulemaking requirements.</E> This paragraph applies only to a closure or restriction, or the termination or relaxation of such, which is of a nature, magnitude and duration that will result in a significant alteration in the public use pattern of the area; adversely affect the area's natural, aesthetic, scenic, or cultural values; or require a long-term modification in the resource management objectives of the area. Except in emergency situations, the closure or restriction, or the termination or relaxation of such, must be published as a rulemaking in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Written determination.</E> Except in emergency situations, prior to implementing or terminating a closure or restriction, the superintendent shall prepare a written determination justifying the action. That determination shall set forth the reasons the closure or restriction authorized by paragraph (a) of this section has been established. This determination will be posted on the NPS Web site at <E T="03">www.nps.gov.</E>

            <SUBJECT>Historical operators.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A historical operator will have a right to continue to provide visitor services in a park area under appropriate terms and conditions contained in a visitor services authorization issued by the Director as long as such services are determined by the Director to be consistent with the purposes for which the park area was established. A historical operator may not operate without such an authorization. The authorization will be for a fixed term. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the authorization will result in cancellation of the authorization and consequent loss of historical operator rights under this subpart.</P>

            <P>(b) Nothing in this subpart will prohibit the Director from permitting persons in addition to historical operators to provide visitor services in park areas at the Director's discretion as long as historical operators are permitted to conduct a scope and level of visitor services equal to those provided before January 1, 1979, under terms and <PRTPAGE P="248"/>conditions consistent with this subpart. A historical operator may be permitted by the Director under separate authority to increase the scope or level of visitor services provided prior to January 1, 1979, but no historical operating rights will be obtained in such increase.</P>
            <P>(c) If a historical operator applies for a visitor services authorization in the form of a joint venture, the application will not be considered as validly made unless the historical operator demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Director, that it has the controlling interest in the joint venture.</P>
            <P>(d) A historical operator may apply to the Director for an authorization or amended authorization to provide visitor services similar to those it provided before January 1, 1979. The Director will grant the request if such visitor services are determined by the Director to be:</P>
            <P>(1) Consistent with the protection of park resources and the purposes for which the park area was established;</P>
            <P>(2) Similar in kind and scope to the visitor services provided by the historical operator before January 1, 1979; and</P>
            <P>(3) Consistent with the legal rights of any other person.</P>
            <P>(e) When a historical operator's visitor services authorization expires, and if the applicable visitor services continue to be consistent with the purposes for which the park area was established as determined by the Director, the Director will offer to renew the authorization for a fixed term under such new terms and conditions as the Director determines are in the public interest.</P>
            <P>(f) If the Director determines that authorized visitor services must be curtailed or reduced in scope, level, or season to protect park resources, or for other purposes, the Director will require the historical operator to make such changes in visitor services. If more than one historical operator providing the same type of visitor services is required to have those services curtailed, the Director will establish a proportionate reduction of visitor services among all such historical operators, taking into account historical operating levels and other appropriate factors so as to achieve a fair curtailment of visitor services among the historical operators. If the level of visitor services must be so curtailed that only one historical operator feasibly may continue to provide the visitor services, the Director will select one historical operator to continue to provide the curtailed visitor services through a competitive selection process.</P>
            <P>(g) Any of the following will result in loss of historical operator status:</P>
            <P>(1) Revocation of an authorization for historic types and levels of visitor services for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the authorization.</P>
            <P>(2) A historical operator's declination of a renewal of the authorization made pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) A change in the controlling interest of the historical operator through sale, assignment, devise, transfer, or by any other means, direct or indirect. A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator that results only in the acquisition of the controlling interest by an individual or individuals who were personally engaged in the visitor services activities of the historical operator before January 1, 1979, will not be deemed a change in the historical operator's controlling interest for the purposes of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(4) A historical operator's failure to provide the authorized services for more than 24 consecutive months.</P>
            <P>(h) The Director may authorize other persons to provide visitor services in a park area in addition to historical operators.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preferred operators.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In selecting persons to provide visitor services for a park area, the Director will, if the number of visitor services authorizations is to be limited, give a preference (subject to any rights of historical operators or CIRI under this subpart) to preferred operators determined qualified to provide such visitor services.</P>

            <P>(b) In such circumstances, the Director will publicly solicit competitive offers for persons to apply for a visitor services authorization, or the renewal of such an authorization, to provide such visitor services pursuant to 36 <PRTPAGE P="249"/>CFR part 51 and/or other National Park Service procedures. All offerors, including preferred operators, must submit a responsive offer to the solicitation in order to be considered for the authorization. If the best offer from a preferred operator is at least substantially equal to the best offer from a non-preferred operator, the preferred operator will receive authorization. If an offer from a person besides a preferred operator is determined to be the best offer (and no preferred operator submits a responsive offer that is substantially equal to it), the preferred operator who submitted the best offer from among the offers submitted by preferred operators will be given the opportunity, by amending its offer, to meet the terms and conditions of the best offer received. If the amended offer of such a preferred operator is considered by the Director as at least substantially equal to the best offer, the preferred operator will receive the visitor service authorization. If a preferred operator does not amend its offer to meet the terms and conditions of the best offer, the Director will issue the authorization to the person who submitted the best offer in response to the solicitation.</P>
            <P>(c) The Native Corporation(s) determined to be “most directly affected”under this subpart and local residents have equal preference. The rights of preferred operators under this section take precedence over the right of preference that may be granted to existing satisfactory National Park Service concessioners pursuant to the Concessions Policy Act (16 U.S.C. 20) and its implementing regulations and procedures, but do not take precedence over the rights of historical operators or CIRI as described in this subpart.</P>
            <P>(d) An offer from a preferred operator under this subpart, if the offer is in the form of a joint venture, will not be considered valid unless it documents to the satisfaction of the Director that the preferred operator holds the controlling interest in the joint venture.</P>
            <P>(e) Nothing in this subpart will prohibit the Director from authorizing persons besides preferred operators to provide visitor services in park areas as long as the procedures described in this section have been followed. Preferred operators are not entitled by this section to provide all visitor services in a park area.</P>
            <P>(f) The preferences described in this section may not be sold, assigned, transferred or devised, directly or indirectly.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preference to Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated (CIRI), in cooperation with village corporations within the Cook Inlet region when appropriate, will have a right of first refusal to provide new visitor services within that portion of Lake Clark National Park and Preserve that is within the boundaries of the Cook Inlet region. In order to exercise this right of first refusal, the National Park Service will publicly solicit competitive offers for the visitor services authorization pursuant to 36 CFR part 51 or other applicable National Park Service procedures. CIRI must submit a responsive offer within 90 days of such solicitation. If CIRI makes such an offer and is determined by the Director to be capable of carrying out the terms and conditions of the visitor services authorization, it will receive the authorization. If it does not, the authorization may be awarded to another person pursuant to usual National Park Service policies and procedures if otherwise appropriate.</P>
            <P>(b) The CIRI right of first refusal will have precedence over the rights of preferred operators. An offer from CIRI under this section, if the offer is in the form of a joint venture, will not be considered valid unless it demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that CIRI has a controlling interest in the joint venture.</P>
            <P>(c) The CIRI right of first refusal may not be sold, transferred, devised or assigned, directly or indirectly.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Most directly affected Native Corporation.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Before the award of the first visitor service authorization in a park area to be made after the effective date of this subpart, the Director will provide an opportunity for any Native Corporation interested in providing visitor services within the applicable <PRTPAGE P="250"/>park area to submit an application to the superintendent to be determined the Native Corporation most directly affected by the establishment or expansion of the park area by or under the provisions of ANILCA. An application from an interested Native Corporation will include the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) Name, address, and phone number of the Native Corporation; date of incorporation; its articles of incorporation and structure;</P>
            <P>(2) Location of the corporation's population center or centers; and</P>
            <P>(3) An assessment of the socioeconomic impacts, including historical and traditional use and land-ownership patterns and their effects on the Native Corporation as a result of the expansion or establishment of the applicable park area by ANILCA.</P>
            <P>(4) Any additional information the Native Corporation considers relevant or the Director may reasonably require.</P>
            <P>(b) Upon receipt of all applications from interested Native Corporations, the Director will determine the “most directly affected” Native Corporation considering the following factors:</P>
            <P>(1) Distance and accessibility from the corporation's population center and/or business address to the applicable park area; and</P>
            <P>(2) Socioeconomic impacts, including historical and traditional use and landownership patterns, on Native Corporations and their effects as a result of the expansion or establishment of the applicable park area; and</P>
            <P>(3) Information provided by Native Corporations and other information considered relevant by the Director to the particular facts and circumstances of the effects of the establishment or expansion of the applicable park area.</P>
            <P>(c) In the event that more than one Native Corporation is determined to be equally affected within the meaning of this section, each such Native Corporation will be considered as a preferred operator under this subpart.</P>
            <P>(d) The Director's most directly affected Native Corporation determination applies to the award of all future visitor service authorizations for the applicable park area. However, a Native Corporation that did not apply for this determination in connection with an earlier visitor services authorization may apply for a determination that it is an equally affected Native Corporation for the applicable park area in connection with a later visitor services authorization. Such subsequent applications must contain the information required by paragraph (a) of this section, and must be made in a timely manner as described by the Director in the applicable solicitation document so as not to delay the consideration of offers for the visitor services authorization.</P>

Such an appeal must be submitted in writing within 30 days of receipt of the denial. Appeals must set forth the facts and circumstances that the appellant believes support the appeal. The appellant may request an informal meeting to discuss the appeal with the National Park Service. After consideration of the materials submitted by the appellant and the National Park Service record of the matter, and meeting with the appellant if so requested, the Director will affirm, reverse, or modify the denial appealed and will set forth in writing the basis of the decision. A copy of the decision will be forwarded to the appellant and will constitute the final administrative decision in the matter. No person will be considered to have exhausted administrative remedies with respect to a denial of rights to provide visitor services under this subpart until a final administrative decision has been made pursuant to this section.</P>

            <P>(a) Consistent with the management of fish and wildlife in accordance with recognized scientific principles and the purposes for which each park area was established, designated, or expanded by ANILCA, the purpose of this subpart is to provide the opportunity for local rural residents engaged in a subsistence way of life to do so pursuant to applicable State and Federal law.</P>
            <P>(b) Consistent with sound management principles, and the conservation of healthy populations of fish and wildlife, the utilization of park areas is to cause the least adverse impact possible on local rural residents who depend upon subsistence uses of the resources of the public lands in Alaska.</P>
            <P>(c) Nonwasteful subsistence uses of fish, wildlife and other renewable resources by local rural residents shall be the priority consumptive uses of such resources over any other consumptive uses permitted within park areas pursuant to applicable State and Federal law.</P>
            <P>(d) Whenever it is necessary to restrict the taking of a fish or wildlife population within a park area for subsistence uses in order to assure the continued viability of such population or to continue subsistence uses of such population, the population shall be allocated among local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses in accordance with a subsistence priority system based on the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(1) Customary and direct dependence upon the resource as the mainstay of one's livelihood;</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the definition of a traditional activity for which Section 1110(a) of ANILCA permits snowmachines to be used in the former Mt. McKinley National Park (Old Park) portion of Denali National Park and Preserve?</SUBJECT>
              <P>A <E T="03">traditional activity</E> is an activity that generally and lawfully occurred in the Old Park contemporaneously with the enactment of ANILCA, and that was associated with the Old Park, or a discrete portion thereof, involving the consumptive use of one or more natural resources of the Old Park such as hunting, trapping, fishing, berry picking or similar activities. Recreational use of snowmachines was not a traditional activity. If a traditional activity generally occurred only in a particular area of the Old Park, it would be considered a traditional activity only in the area where it had previously occurred. In addition, a traditional activity must be a legally permissible activity in the Old Park.</P>

              <SUBJECT>May a snowmachine be used in that portion of the park formerly known as Mt. McKinley National Park (Old Park)?</SUBJECT>

              <P>No, based on the application of the definition of traditional activities within the park to the factual history of the Old Park, there are no traditional activities that occurred during periods of adequate snow cover within the Old Park; and, thus, Section 1110(a) of ANILCA does not authorize snowmachine access. Hunting and trapping were not and are not legally permitted activities in the Old Park at any time of the year. Sport fishing has not taken place in the Old Park during periods of adequate snow cover due to weather conditions that are adverse to sport fishing, and the limited fishery resources within the Old Park. During periods of adequate snow cover, berry picking is not feasible, and has not taken place in the Old Park. Under the definition, recreational use of snowmachines is not a traditional activity. There are no villages, homesites or other valid occupancies within the Old Park. Access by snowmachine through the Old Park in transit to <PRTPAGE P="262"/>homesites, villages and other valid occupancies was not lawful prior to the enactment of ANILCA and is available through routes outside the Old Park that have been historically used for that purpose. Therefore, the use of snowmachines is not authorized by section 1110(a) for such travel. Further, Congress did not authorize subsistence activities in the Old Park. In addition, the National Park Service has determined that the use of even a few snowmachines in the Old Park would be detrimental to the resource values of the area. Therefore, because no usage is authorized in the Old Park by section 1110(a) the Old Park remains closed to all snowmachine use in accordance with 36 CFR 2.18.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Maps.</E> Each application, other than an appropriation for Federal-aid highway purposes under Title 23, United States Code, section 317, must be accompanied by a map prepared on tracing linen, or on tracing paper having a 100 percent rag content, and three or, in the case of electric transmission lines, five print copies thereof, showing the survey of the right-of-way, properly located with respect to the public land surveys so that said right-of-way may be accurately located on the ground by any competent engineer or land surveyor. The map should comply with the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) The scale should be 2,000 feet to the inch for rights-of-way for such structures as canals, ditches, pipelines and transmission lines and 1,000 feet to the inch for rights-of-way for reservoirs, except where a larger scale is required to represent properly the details of the proposed developments, in which case the scales should be 1,000 feet to the inch and 500 feet to the inch, respectively. For electric transmission lines having a nominal voltage of less than 33 kV. map scales may at option of the applicant be 5,280 feet to the inch.</P>
            <P>(2) Courses and distances of the center line of the right-of-way or traverse line of the reservoir should be given; the courses referred to the true meridian either by deflection from a line of known bearing or by independent observation, and the distances in feet and decimals thereof. Station numbers with plus distances at deflection points on the traverse line should be shown.</P>
            <P>(3) The initial and terminal points of the survey should be accurately connected by course and distance to the nearest corner of the public-land surveys, unless that corner is more than 6 miles distant, in which case the connection will be made to some prominent natural object or permanent monument, which can be readily recognized and recovered. The station number and plus distance to the point of intersection with a line of the public-land surveys should be ascertained and noted, together with the course and distance along the section line to the nearest existing corner, at a sufficient number of points throughout the township to permit accurate platting of the relative position of the right-of-way to the public-land survey.</P>
            <P>(4) If the right-of-way is across or within lands which are not covered by the public-land surveys, the map shall be made in terms of the boundary survey of the land to the extent it would be required above to be made in terms of the public-land surveys.</P>
            <P>(5) All subdivisions of the public-land surveys within the limits of the survey should be shown in their entirety, based upon the official subsisting plats, with the subdivisions, section, township, and range clearly marked.</P>

            <P>(6) The width of the canal, ditch, or lateral at high-water line should be given and the width of all other rights-of-way shall be given. If the width is <PRTPAGE P="286"/>not uniform, the location and amount of the change in width must be definitely shown. In the case of a pipeline, the diameter of the line should be given. The total distance of the right-of-way on the Federal lands shall be stated.</P>
            <P>(7) Each copy of the map should bear upon its face a statement of the engineer who made the survey and the certificate of the applicant. The statement and certificate referred to are embodied in Forms 1 and 2 (Appendix A) which are made a part hereof and which should be modified so as to be appropriate to the act invoked and the nature of the project.</P>
            <P>(8) Whenever it is found that a public land survey monument or reservation boundary monument will be destroyed or rendered inaccessible by reason of the proposed development, at least two permanent marked witness monuments should be established at suitable points, preferably on the surveyed lines.

It directs any such agency to cooperate with the Secretary of Transportation in this connection.</P>
            <P>(b) Title 23, United States Code, section 317, provides that:</P>
            <P>(1) If the Secretary of Transportation determines that any part of the lands or interests in lands owned by the United States is reasonably necessary for the right-of-way of any highway constructed on the Federal-aid primary system, the Federal-aid secondary system and the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, or under Title 23, United States Code, Chapter 2, or as a source of materials for the construction or maintenance of any such highway adjacent to such lands or interests in lands, the Secretary of Transportation shall file with the Secretary of the Department supervising the administration of such lands or interests in lands a map showing the portion of such lands or interests in lands which it is desired to appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) If within a period of 4 months after such filing the Secretary of such department shall not have certified to the Secretary of Transportation that the proposed appropriation of such land or material is contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the purposes for which such lands or materials have been reserved or shall have agreed to the appropriation and transfer under conditions which he deems necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of the reserve, then such lands and materials may be appropriated and transferred to the State highway department or its nominee, for such purposes and subject to the conditions so specified.</P>

            <P>(a) By accepting a right-of-way for a power transmission line, the applicant thereby agrees and consents to comply <PRTPAGE P="291"/>with and be bound by the following terms and conditions, excepting those which the Secretary may waive in a particular case, in addition to those specified in § 14.9.</P>
            <P>(1) To protect in a workmanlike manner, at crossings and at places in proximity to his transmission lines on the right-of-way authorized, in accordance with the rules prescribed in the National Electric Safety Code, all Government and other telephone, telegraph, and power transmission lines from contact and all highways and railroads from obstruction, and to maintain his transmission lines in such manner as not to menace life or property.</P>
            <P>(2) Neither the privilege nor the right to occupy or use the lands for the purpose authorized shall relieve him of any legal liability for causing inductive or conductive interference between any project transmission line or other project works constructed, operated, or maintained by him on the servient lands, and any radio installation, telephone line, or other communication facilities now or hereafter constructed and operated by the United States or any agency thereof.</P>

            <P>(3) Each application for authority to survey, locate, commence construction work and maintain a facility for the generation of electric power and energy or for the transmission or distribution of electric power and energy of 33 kilovolts or higher under this subpart shall be referred by the authorized officer to the Secretary of the Interior to determine the relationship of the proposed facility to the power marketing program of the United States. Where the proposed facility will not conflict with the program of the United States the authorized officer, upon notification to that effect, will proceed to act upon the application. In the case of necessary changes respecting the proposed location, construction, or utilization of the facility in order to eliminate conflicts with the power-marketing program of the United States, the authorized officer shall obtain from the applicant written consent to or compliance with such requirements before taking further action on the application: <E T="03">Provided however,</E> That if increased costs to the applicant will result from changes to eliminate conflicts with the power-marketing program of the United States, and it is determined that a right-of-way should be granted, such changes will be required upon equitable contract arrangements covering costs and other appropriate factors.</P>
            <P>(4) The applicant shall make provision, or bear the reasonable cost (as may be determined by the Secretary) of making provision for avoiding inductive or conductive interference between any transmission facility or other works constructed, operated, or maintained by it on the right-of-way authorized under the grant and any radio installation, telephone line, or other communication facilities existing when the right-of-way is authorized or any such installation, line or facility thereafter constructed or operated by the United States or any agency thereof. This provision shall not relieve the applicant from any responsibility or requirement which may be imposed by other lawful authority for avoiding or eliminating inductive or conductive interference.</P>
            <P>(5) An applicant for a right-of-way for a transmission facility having a voltage of 66 kilovolts or more must, in addition to the requirements of Subpart C, execute and file with its application a stipulation agreeing to accept the right-of-way grant subject to the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(i) In the event the United States, pursuant to law, acquires the applicant's transmission or other facilities constructed on or across such right-of-way, the price to be paid by the United States shall not include or be affected by any value of the right-of-way granted to the applicant under authority of the regulations of this part.</P>

            <P>(ii) The Department of the Interior shall be allowed to utilize for the transmission of electric power and energy and surplus capacity of the transmission facility in excess of the capacity needed by the holder of the grant (subsequently referred to in this paragraph as “holder”) for the transmission of electric power and energy in connection with the holder's operations, or to increase the capacity of the transmission facility at the Department's <PRTPAGE P="292"/>expense and to utilize the increased capacity for the transmission of electric power and energy utilization by the Department of surplus or increased capacity shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:</P>
            <P>(A) When the Department desires to utilize surplus capacity thought to exist in the transmission facility, notification will be given to the holder and the holder shall furnish to the Department within 30 days a certificate stating whether the transmission facility has any surplus capacity not needed by the holder for the transmission of electric power and energy in connection with the holder's operations and, if so, the amount of such surplus capacity.</P>
            <P>(B) Where the certificate indicates that there is no surplus capacity or that the surplus capacity is less than that required by the Department the authorized officer may call upon the holder to furnish additional information upon which its certification is based. Upon receipt of such additional information the authorized officer shall determine, as a matter of fact, if surplus capacity is available and, if so, the amount of such surplus capacity.</P>
            <P>(C) In order to utilize any surplus capacity determined to be available, or any increased capacity provided by the Department at its own expense, the Department may interconnect its transmission facilities with the holder's transmission facility in a manner conforming to approved standards of practice for the interconnection of transmission circuits.</P>
            <P>(D) The expense of interconnection will be borne by the Department, and the Department will at all times provide and maintain adequate protective equipment to insure the normal and efficient operation of the holder's transmission facilities.</P>
            <P>(E) After any interconnection is completed, the holder shall operate and maintain its transmission facilities in good condition, and, except in emergencies, shall maintain in a closed position all connections under the holder's control necessary to the transmission of the Department's power and energy over the holder's transmission facilities. The parties may by mutual consent open any switch where necessary or desirable for maintenance, repair or construction.</P>
            <P>(F) The transmission of electric power and energy by the Department over the holder's transmission facilities will be effected in such manner, as will not interfere unreasonably with the holder's use of the transmission facilities in accordance with the holder's normal operating standards, except that the Department shall have the exclusive right to utilize any increased capacity of the transmission facility which has been provided at the Department's expense.</P>
            <P>(G) The holder will not be obligated to allow the transmission of electric power and energy by the Department to any person receiving service from the holder on the date of the filing of the application for a grant, other than statutory preference customers including agencies of the Federal Government.</P>
            <P>(H) The Department will pay to the holder an equitable share of the total monthly cost of that part of the holder's transmission facilities utilized by the Department for the transmission of electric power and energy the payment to be an amount in dollars representing the same proportion of the total monthly cost of such part of the transmission facilities as the maximum amount in kilowatts of the power transmitted on a scheduled basis by the Department over the holder's transmission facilities bears to the total capacity in kilowatts of that portion of the transmission facilities. The total monthly cost will be determined in accordance with the system of accounts prescribed by the Federal Power Commission, exclusive of any investment by the Department in the part of the transmission facilities utilized by the Department.</P>

            <P>(I) If, at any time subsequent to a certification by the holder or determination by the authorized officer that surplus capacity is available for utilization by the Department, the holder needs for the transmission of electric power and energy in connection with its operations the whole or any part of the capacity of the transmission facility theretofore certified or determined as being surplus to its needs, the holder may request the authorized officer to <PRTPAGE P="293"/>modify or revoke the previous certification or determination by making application to the authorized officer not later than 36 months in advance of the holder's needs. Any modification or revocation of the certification or determination shall not affect the right of the Department to utilize facilities provided at its expense or available under a contract entered into by reason of the equitable contract arrangements provided for in this section.</P>
            <P>(J) If the Department and the holder disagree as to the existence or amount of surplus capacity in carrying out the terms and conditions of this paragraph, the disagreement shall be decided by a board of three persons composed as follows: The holder and the authorized officer shall each appoint a member of the board and the two members shall appoint a third member. If the members appointed by the holder and the authorized officer are unable to agree on the designation of the third member, he shall be designated by the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals of the circuit in which the major share of the facilities involved is located. The board shall determine the issue and its determination, by majority vote, shall be binding on the Department and the holder.</P>

            <P>(K) As used in this section, the term “transmission facility” includes (<E T="03">1</E>) all types of facilities for the transmission of electric power and energy and facilities for the interconnection of such facilities, and (<E T="03">2</E>) the entire transmission line and associated facilities, from substation or interconnection point to substation or interconnection point, of which the segment crossing the lands of the United States forms a part.</P>
            <P>(L) The terms and conditions prescribed in this paragraph may be modified at any time by means of a supplemental agreement negotiated between the holder and the Secretary of the Interior or his designee.</P>
            <P>(b) Unless otherwise specified in a right-of-way granted under the Act of March 4, 1911, and unless sooner cancelled, the right-of-way shall expire 50 years from the date thereof. If, however, within the period of 1 year prior to the expiration date, the grantee shall file, in accordance with § 14.20, a written application to renew the right-of-way, and shall agree to comply with all the laws and regulations existing at such expiration date governing the occupancy and use of the lands of the United States for the purpose desired, the right-of-way may be renewed for a period of not to exceed 50 years. If such application is filed, the existing right-of-way will be extended subject to then existing and future rules and regulations, pending consideration of the application.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Applications.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applications filed.</E> Application under the Act of February 15, 1901, or the Act of March 4, 1911, for permission to use the desired right-of-way through National Park Service areas must be filed and approved before any rights can be claimed thereunder.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Required showings.</E> (1) A description of the plant or connecting generating plants which generate the power to be transmitted over such line, such description to be in sufficient detail to show, to the satisfaction of the authorized officer, the character, capacity, and location of such plants.</P>
            <P>(2) A description of the transmission line of which the line for which a right-of-way is requested forms a part, giving in reasonable detail the points between which it will extend, its characteristics and purpose. There must also be included a statement as to the voltage for which the line is designed and at which it is to be operated initially, and a statement as to whether it is to serve a single customer, or a number of customers, or is intended to transmit power solely for the applicant's use. If the line is to serve a single customer or is for the applicant's own use, the nature of such use must be given (such as airway beacon, coal mine, and irrigation pumps).</P>

            <P>(3) The application and maps shall specify the width of the right-of-way desired. Rights-of-way for power lines will be limited to 50 feet on each side of the centerline unless sufficient justification is furnished for a greater width and it is otherwise authorized by law.<PRTPAGE P="294"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) If the line is to have a nominal voltage of 66 kilovolts or more, the application should include a one-line diagram of the proposed line and the immediate interconnecting facilities including power plants and substations, a power flow diagram for proposed line and connecting major lines showing conditions under normal use, and typical structure drawings of proposed line showing construction dimensions and list of materials.</P>
            <P>(5) Any application under the Act of March 4, 1911, for a line right-of-way in excess of 100 feet in width or for a structure or facility right-of-way over 10,000 square feet must state the reasons why the larger right-of-way is required. Rights-of-way will not be issued in excess of such sizes in the absence of a satisfactory showing of the need therefor.</P>
            <P>(6)(i) A detailed description of the environmental impact of the project shall be included with the application. It shall provide, among other things, information about the impact of the project on airspace, air and water quality, scenic and esthetic features, historical and archeological features, and wildlife, fish, and marine life.</P>
            <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(iii) If all other requirements are met, the application may be approved if it is determined that the beneficial purposes and effects of the project will not be outweighed by an adverse environmental impact. If the authorized officer determines that the application cannot be approved as proposed, he will, whenever possible, suggest alternative routes or methods of construction, or other modifications which if adopted by the applicant would make the application acceptable.</P>

          <P>Bids may be made by the principal or his agent, either personally or by mail. Bids will be considered only if received at the place and prior to the hour fixed in the notice. No particular form is specified for bids. However, a bid must be in writing, clearly identify the bidder, be signed by the bidder or his designated agent, state the amount of the bid, and refer to the notice. Bids conditioned in ways not provided for by the notice will not be considered. Bids must be accompanied by certified checks, post office money orders, bank drafts, or cashier's checks made payable to the United States of America for 2 percent of the amount of the fair market value or $2,500, whichever is greater, in the case of a freehold interest or for the amount of the first year's rent in the case of a leasehold interest. This payment will be refunded to unsuccessful bidders. A separate nonrefundable payment of $100 to cover costs of publication and of processing of bids will also be included with the bid. The bid and payments must be enclosed in a sealed envelope upon which the prospective bidder shall write: (a) Bid on interest in land of the National Park System, and (b) the scheduled date the bids are to be opened. In the event two or more valid bids are received in the same amount, the determination of which is the highest will be by drawing. Bids will be opened at the time and place specified in the notice. Bidders, their agents or representatives, and any other persons may attend the bid opening. No bid in an amount less than the fair market value, as herein defined, shall be considered.</P>

          <FP>If within 30 days of mailing of such notification, the former owner or owners do not indicate a desire to acquire the interest and make payment or agree to make payment for such interest in an amount equal to the declared high bid, or, if they do indicate such a desire but fail to consummate the transaction within the time period established for the conveyance, then the bid of the declared high bidder will be accepted. In the event that a former owner who indicates a desire to repurchase pursuant to this procedure fails to consummate the transaction within the established time period the declared high bidder shall be permitted, but not required, to consummate the transaction. If the declared high bidder does not choose to consummate the transaction in this circumstance, the entire transaction will be cancelled, and, if appropriate, a new bidding procedure instituted.</FP>

          <P>(b) The lease will not deprive the park area of property necessary for appropriate park protection, interpretation, visitor enjoyment, or administration of the park area;</P>

          <P>Property may be leased under this part only if the lease requires payment of rent to the government equal to or higher than the property's fair market value rent. The determination of fair market value rent shall take into account:</P>
          <P>(a) Any restrictions on the use of the property or terms of the lease that limit the value and/or the highest and best use of the property; and</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 18.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>How are lease proposals solicited and selected if the Director issues a Request for Bids?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) If the amount of the rent is the only criterion for award of a lease, the Director may solicit bids through issuance of a request for bids as described in this section. If historic property is to be leased under the authority of this section, the Director must comply with 36 CFR part 800 (commenting procedures of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation) at an appropriate time during the leasing process.</P>

          <P>(b) A request for bids under this section shall be advertised by public notice published at least twice in local and/or national newspapers of general circulation. The notice shall provide at least a thirty (30) day period from the <PRTPAGE P="301"/>last date of publication for the submission of sealed bids. The notice will provide necessary information to prospective bidders. It may specify a minimum rent and/or require submission of a rent deposit or advance rent payment. Bids will be considered only if timely received at the place designated in the request. Bids must be in the form specified by the Director, or, if no form is specified, a bid must be in writing, signed by the bidder or authorized representative, state the amount of the bid, and refer to the applicable public notice. If the notice requires submission of a rent deposit or advance rent payment, the bids must include the required funds in the form of a certified check, post office money order, bank drafts, or cashier's checks made out to the United States of America. The bid (and payment where applicable) must be enclosed in a sealed envelope upon which the bidder shall write: “Bid on lease of property of the National Park Service” and shall note the date the bids are to be opened.</P>
          <P>(c) Bids will be opened publicly by the Director at a time and place specified in the public notice. Bidders or their representatives may attend the bid opening. The bidder submitting a responsive bid offering the highest rent will be selected for award of the lease (subject to a determination of financial capability by the Director). A responsive bid is a bid that meets the material terms and conditions of the request for bids. The Director shall accept no bid in an amount less than the fair market rental value as determined by the Director. If two or more bids are equal, a drawing shall make the lease award by lot limited to the equal responsive bids received.</P>
          <P>(d) When a property is to be leased through a request for bids, the bidder that is declared by the Director to be the high bidder shall be bound by his bid and this part to execute the offered lease, unless the bid is rejected. If the declared high bidder fails to enter into the lease for any reason, the Director may choose to enter into the lease with the next highest bidder (if that bidder offered to pay at least the fair market rent value). The Director may reject any and all bids in his discretion and resolicit or cancel a lease solicitation under this part at any time without liability to any person.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 18.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>How are lease proposals solicited and selected if the Director issues a Request for Proposals?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) When the award of a lease is to be based on selection criteria in addition to or other than the amount of the rent, the Director must, subject to § 18.9, solicit proposals for the lease through issuance of a public Request for Proposals (RFP).</P>
          <P>(b) An RFP may be preceded by issuance of a public Request for Qualifications (RFQ). The purpose of an RFQ is to select a “short list” of potential offerors that meet minimum management, financial and other qualifications necessary for submission of a proposal in response to an RFP. If the Director issues an RFQ, only persons determined as qualified by the Director under the terms of the RFQ shall be eligible to submit a proposal under the related RFP.</P>

          <P>(c) The Director must provide public notice of the leasing opportunity by publication at least twice in local and/or national newspapers of general circulation and/or through publication in the Commerce Business Daily. The public notice shall contain general information about the leasing opportunity and advise interested persons how to obtain a copy of the RFP (or RFQ where applicable). The RFP (and RFQ where applicable) shall contain appropriate information about the property proposed for lease, including limitations on the uses of the property to be leased, information concerning the leasing process, information and materials that must be contained in a proposal, the time and place for submission of proposals, terms and conditions of the lease, and the criteria under which the Director will evaluate proposals. The RFP may state the fair market value rent as the minimum acceptable rent if determined by the Director at that time. The RFP (and RFQ where applicable) must allow at least sixty (60) days for submission of proposals (or qualifications under an RFQ) unless a shorter period of time is determined to be sufficient in the circumstances of a particular solicitation.<PRTPAGE P="302"/>
          </P>
          <P>(d) The Director may determine that a proposal is non-responsive and not consider it further. A non-responsive proposal is a proposal that was not timely submitted or fails to meet the material terms and conditions of the RFP. After the submission of offers and prior to the selection of the best overall proposal, the Director may request from any offeror additional information or written clarification of a proposal, provided that proposals may not be amended after the submission date unless all offerors that submitted responsive proposals are given an opportunity to amend their proposals. The Director may choose to reject all proposals received at any time and resolicit or cancel a solicitation under this part without liability to any person.</P>
          <P>(e) (1) The criteria to be used in selection of the best proposal are:</P>
          <P>(i) The compatibility of the proposal's intended use of the leased property with respect to preservation, protection, and visitor enjoyment of the park;</P>
          <P>(ii) The financial capability of the offeror to carry out the terms of the lease;</P>
          <P>(iii) The experience of the offeror demonstrating the managerial capability to carry out the terms of the lease;</P>
          <P>(iv) The ability and commitment of the offeror to conduct its activities in the park area in an environmentally enhancing manner through, among other programs and actions, energy conservation, waste reduction, and recycling; and</P>
          <P>(v) Any other criteria the RFP may specify.</P>
          <P>(2) If the property to be leased is an historic property, the compatibility of the proposal with the historic qualities of the property shall be an additional selection criterion. If the RFP requires proposals to include the amount of rent offered, the amount of rent offered also shall be an additional selection criterion.</P>
          <P>(f) The Director will evaluate all responsive proposals received. The responsive proposal determined by the Director to best meet on an overall basis the evaluation criteria will be selected for negotiation of the lease. If two or more responsive proposals are determined by the Director to be substantially equal under the evaluation criteria, the Director shall provide an opportunity for those proposals to be amended by their offerors as necessary for the Director to select the best amended proposal. In such circumstances, the Director will provide each offeror that submitted a substantially equal proposal appropriate information as to how their proposals may be amended in order to enhance the possibility of selection as the best amended proposal. If two or more proposals remain as substantially equal after amendment, the Director will select for negotiation of the lease from among these proposals the proposal that the Director determines on an overall basis will be most beneficial to effective management of the park area.</P>
          <P>(g) The Director will provide the offeror that submitted the best overall responsive proposal as determined by the Director a specified period of time to negotiate the final terms of the lease (and may enter into a letter of intent to negotiate in this connection). The final terms of the lease must be consistent with the requirements of the RFP. If the negotiations do not result in an executed lease within the specified time period, the Director, in his discretion, may extend the negotiation period, terminate negotiations and negotiate with the offeror that submitted the next best responsive proposal, or, cancel the solicitation.</P>
          <P>(h) RFPs may state that the amount of rent to be paid will be negotiated subsequently with the offeror that submitted the best proposal, initially or as amended. The Director may execute a lease only if the Director determines that it requires the lessee to pay at least the fair market value rent of the leased property.</P>
          <P>(i) The Director may execute a lease that includes historic property only after complying with 36 CFR part 800 (commenting procedures of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation).</P>

          <SUBJECT>When may the Director lease property without issuing a request for bids or a request for proposals?</SUBJECT>

          <P>The Director, except as provided in this section, may not lease property <PRTPAGE P="303"/>without issuing a request for bids or a request for proposals in compliance with § 18.7 or § 18.8. The Director under this part may enter into leases with non-profit organizations (recognized as such by the Internal Revenue Service) or units of government without complying with §§ 18.7 or 18.8 if the Director determines that the non-profit or governmental use of the property will contribute to the purposes and programs of the park area. All other requirements of this part are applicable to leases entered into or to be entered into under authority of this section. The Director may enter into leases under this part with a term of sixty (60) days or less without complying with §§ 18.7 or 18.8 if the Director determines that to do so is in the best interests of the administration of the park area. If historic land is to be leased under the authority of this section, the Director must comply with 36 CFR part 800 (commenting procedures of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation) before entering into the lease.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 18.10</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>How long can the term of a lease be?</SUBJECT>
          <P>All leases entered into under this part shall have as short a term as possible, taking into account the financial obligations of the lessee and other factors related to determining an appropriate lease term. No lease shall have a term of more than 60 years. Leases entered under the authority of this part may not be extended, except that, leases with an initial term of one (1) year or more may be extended once for a period not to exceed one (1) additional year if the Director determines that an extension is necessary because of circumstances beyond the Director's control.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 18.11</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>What general provisions must a lease contain?</SUBJECT>
          <P>All leases entered into under this part must contain terms and conditions that are determined necessary by the Director to assure use of the leased property in a manner consistent with the purposes of the applicable park area as established by law, and where applicable, to assure the preservation of historic property.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 18.12</SECTNO>

          <P>(a) A termination for cause or default provision;</P>
          <P>(b) Appropriate provisions requiring the lessee to maintain the leased property in good condition throughout the term of the lease;</P>
          <P>(c) Appropriate provisions stating that subletting of a portion of the leased property and assignment of a lease, if permissible under the terms of the lease, must be subject to the Director's written approval. Such subleases and assignments shall be approved only of the Director determines, among other relevant matters, that the proposed sub-lessee or assignee is financially and managerially capable of carrying out the terms of the lease. Assignment of a lease for the purpose of effectuating an encumbrance to the lease or the leased property is subject to approval pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (l) of this section;</P>
          <P>(d) Appropriate provisions requiring the lessee to secure and maintain from responsible companies liability insurance sufficient to cover losses connected with or occasioned by the use and activities authorized by the lease. Types and amounts of insurance coverage will be specified in writing and periodically reviewed by the Director;</P>
          <P>(e) Appropriate provisions, unless the Director determines otherwise in the circumstances of a particular lease, requiring the lessee to obtain from responsible companies casualty insurance (including flood insurance if applicable) in an amount sufficient to protect the interests of the lessee and the government. In the event of casualty, the lessee shall be required to repair or replace damaged or destroyed property unless otherwise determined by the Director;</P>

          <P>(f) Appropriate provisions requiring the lessee to save, hold harmless, and indemnify the United States of America and its agents and employees for all losses, damages, or judgments and expenses resulting from personal injury, <PRTPAGE P="304"/>death or property damage of any nature arising out of the lessee's activities under the lease, and/or the activities of the lessee's employees, subcontractors, sub-lessees, or agents. No lease entered into this part may contain provisions intended to provide indemnification or other assurances to the lessee regarding the conduct or activities of the Director concerning the lease or the administration of the applicable park area. Leases may contain appropriate provisions that commit the Director to accept responsibility for tortious actions of government officials to the extent authorized by the Federal Torts Claim Act or as otherwise expressly authorized by law;</P>
          <P>(g) Appropriate provisions requiring the lessee to pay for use of all utilities used by the lessee and to pay all taxes and assessments imposed by federal, state, or local agencies applicable to the leased property or to lessee activities;</P>
          <P>(h) Appropriate provisions stating that the lessee has no rights of renewal of the lease or to the award of a new lease upon lease termination or expiration and that the lease is subject to cancellation by the Director in the exercise of the sovereign authority of the United States to the extent provided by applicable law;</P>

Approval by the Director of new construction may only be granted if the Director makes the determinations required by § 18.4;</P>
          <P>(j) Appropriate provisions requiring that:</P>
          <P>(1) Any improvements to or demolition of leased property to be made by the lessee may be undertaken only with written approval from the Director;</P>
          <P>(2) That any improvements to or demolition of historic property may only be approved if the Director determines that the improvements or demolition complies with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (36 CFR part 68); and</P>
          <P>(3) Any improvements made by a lessee shall be the property of the United States;</P>
          <P>(k) Appropriate provisions that describe and limit the type of activities that may be conducted by the lessee on the leased property.

          <P>(l) Appropriate provisions, unless the Director determines not to permit pledges or encumbrances in the circumstances of a particular lease, authorizing the lessee to pledge or encumber the lease as security, provided that any pledge or encumbrance of the lease and the proposed holder of the pledge or encumbrance must be approved in writing in advance by the Director and that a pledge or encumbrance may only grant the holder the right, in the event of a foreclosure, to assume the responsibilities of the lessee under the lease or to select a new lessee subject to the approval of the Director.

          <SUBJECT>General objectives.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Consistent with the objectives set out in section 5 of the Act of August 7, 1961 (75 Stat. 284), development and management of the Cape Cod National Seashore will be conducted in a manner which will assure the widest possible <PRTPAGE P="310"/>public use, understanding and enjoyment of its natural, cultural and scientific features. The regulations in this part are designed and promulgated to establish minimum standards which local zoning bylaws must meet in furtherance of those purposes.</P>
          <P>(b) The standards hereby established for approval of zoning bylaws or amendments of zoning bylaws—are intended: (1) To contribute to the effect of prohibiting the commercial and industrial use, other than existing commercial or industrial use not inconsistent with the purposes of the Act of August 7, 1961 (75 Stat. 284, 291), of all property within the boundaries of the Cape Cod National Seashore and situated in the towns of Provincetown, Truro, Wellfleet, Eastham, Orleans and Chatham; and (2) to promote preservation and development, in accordance with the purposes of the said Act, of the area comprising the seashore, by means of acreage, frontage and setback requirements and other provisions which may be required to be included in zoning bylaws consistent with the laws of Massachusetts. Zoning bylaws or amendments of zoning bylaws applicable to the area within Cape Cod National Seashore, in order that they may be approved, shall conform to the standards herein set forth relating to preservation and development of the seashore in accordance with the purposes of the said Act. The Secretary shall be given notice of any amendments to approved zoning bylaws that affect the Seashore District. Nothing in these standards or in the zoning bylaws adopted pursuant thereto for the area within Cape Cod National Seashore shall preclude the Secretary of the Interior from fulfilling the responsibilities vested in him by the Act of August 7, 1961, or by the Act of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535), as amended and supplemented.</P>
          <P>(c) Wherever the term “improved property” is used in this part it shall mean a detached, one-family dwelling, the land on which it is situated, and accessory structures, and as further defined in section 4(d) of the Act of August 7, 1961 (75 Stat. 284).</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Description.</E> The Seashore District shall include all those portions of the towns of Provincetown, Truro, Wellfleet, Eastham, Orleans and Chatham lying within the exterior boundaries of the Cape Cod National Seashore.</P>
          <P>(b) Zoning bylaws for the Seashore District shall be consistent with the objectives and purposes of the Act of August 7, 1961, so that—to the extent possible under Massachusetts law—the scenic, scientific and cultural values of the area will be protected, undeveloped areas will be preserved in a natural condition, and the distinctive Cape Cod character of existing residential structures will be maintained.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) No moving, alteration, or enlargement of existing one-family residential dwellings or structures accessory thereto situated within this District shall be permitted if such would afford less than a 50-foot setback from all streets measured at a right angle with the street line, and a 25-foot distance from the abutters' property lines (or less than such lesser setback or distance requirements already in existence for such dwellings or accessory structures).</P>
          <P>(2) If through natural phenomena or causes a lot or lots are so diminished in size that an owner would be unable to comply with the setback or sideline requirements herein prescribed, such owner or the zoning authorities may, as provided in § 27.4(b), request the Secretary of the Interior to determine whether a proposed move, reconstruction, alteration of enlargement of an existing residential dwelling or accessory structure would subject the property to acquisition by condemnation.</P>

          <P>(d) Zoning bylaws adopted pursuant to this regulation shall contain provisions designed to preserve the seashore character of the area by appropriate restrictions or prohibitions upon the burning of cover, cutting of timber, filling of land, removal of soil, loam, sand or gravel and dumping, storage, or <PRTPAGE P="311"/>piling of refuse and other unsightly objects or other uses which would detract from the natural or traditional seashore scene.</P>

          <P>(e) Zoning bylaws for the Seashore District may permit residential uses of “improved property” and other uses of such dwellings and their accessory structures: <E T="03">Provided,</E> Such other uses are traditional to these seashore communities, are customarily incidental to the principal residential use and do not alter the essential character of the dwelling and premises as a private residence. Subject to those conditions such uses may include, but are not limited to: (1) Partial use of dwellings by residents for a professional office (as for the practice of theology, law or medicine), as an artists' studio, for appropriate small scale home occupations as the making and selling of traditional Cape Cod products produced on the premises, and for the rental of rooms and serving of meals by residents of the premises to overnight guests; (2) the existence of structures, such as a garage, barn or boathouse accessory to the dwelling; (3) display of a sign which may be indirectly but not directly illuminated and not to exceed two square feet in area, referring to the occupancy, sale, or rental of the premises; (4) traditional agricultural uses of cleared land, but not including such objectionable uses as a piggery or the raising of livestock, poultry or fur-bearing animals for commercial purposes; and (5) the opening of shellfish, the storage and use of fishing equipment, and other traditional fishing activities. No commercial or industrial ventures (other than of the types described above), may be established within the Seashore District.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Variances and exceptions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Zoning bylaws may provide for variances and exceptions.</P>
          <P>(b) Bylaws adopted pursuant to these standards shall contain provisions which constitute notice to applicants for variances and exceptions that, under section 5(d) of the Act of August 7, 1961, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to withdraw the suspension of his authority to acquire, by condemnation, “improved property” that is made the subject of a variance or exception which, in his opinion, fails to conform or is in any manner opposed to or inconsistent with preservation and development of the seashore as contemplated in the said Act. The Secretary may be consulted at any time by zoning authorities or by the owner of “improved property” regarding the effect of a proposed variance or exception upon the status of the affected property with regard to the suspension of the Secretary's authority to condemn. The Secretary, within 60 days of the receipt of a request for such determination, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible, shall advise the owner or zoning authorities whether or not the intended use will subject the property to acquisition by condemnation.</P>
          <P>(c) The Secretary shall be promptly notified of the granting of any variance or exception.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The enabling legislation for Fire Island National Seashore (the Seashore) mandated the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to issue regulations which provide standards for local zoning in order to protect and conserve Fire Island. The regulations in this part set forth Federal standards to which local ordinances for Fire Island must conform to enable certain private property within the Seashore to be exempt from Federal condemnation. The standards also apply to use and development of public property. From time to time these standards may be reviewed and revised. These standards are intended:</P>
            <P>(1) To promote the protection and development of the land within the Seashore, for the purposes of the Fire Island National Seashore Act (the Act), by means of size, location, or use limitations or restrictions on commercial, residential, or other structures with the objective of controlling population density and protecting the island's natural resources;</P>
            <P>(2) To limit development and use of land to single-family homes, to prohibit development and use of multiple family homes, and to prohibit the conversion of structures to multiple family homes;</P>
            <P>(3) To prohibit commercial or industrial uses initiated after September 11, 1964 or the expansion of existing commercial or industrial uses on any property within the Seashore which is inconsistent with the Federal standards and approved local ordinances or the purposes of the Act, is likely to cause a significant harm to the resources of the Seashore or will not provide a service to Fire Island;</P>
            <P>(4) To recognize that the zoning authorities have the primary responsibility for zoning enforcement within the Seashore;</P>
            <P>(5) To provide that private property within the Community Development District may be retained by its owner as long as it is maintained in accordance with approved local ordinances and the Federal standards;</P>
            <P>(6) To provide that, within the Seashore District, private “improved property” may be retained by its owner as long as it is maintained in accordance with approved local ordinances, and the Federal standards;</P>
            <P>(7) To provide that, in the Dune District, private undeveloped property, if otherwise subject to condemnation, may be retained by its owner as long as it is maintained in its natural state; and</P>
            <P>(8) To provide a mechanism for the Superintendent to inform landowners and the zoning authority if a use or development will be inconsistent with the Federal standards or the purposes of the Act and may subject the property to condemnation, subject to available funds.</P>
            <P>(b) The Secretary may utilize any other statutory authority available to the Secretary for the conservation and development of natural resources to the extent the Secretary finds that such authority will further the purpose of the Act.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Administration of the Whiskeytown Unit is required to be coordinated with the other purposes of the Central Valley project and with the purposes of the recreation area as a whole so as to provide for: (1) Public outdoor recreation benefits; (2) conservation of scenic, scientific, historic, and other values contributing to public enjoyment; and (3) such management, utilization and disposal of renewable natural resources as in the judgment of the Secretary of the Interior will promote or is compatible with, and does not significantly impair, public recreation and conservation of scenic, scientific, historic, or other values contributing to public enjoyment.</P>
          <P>(b) The Secretary may not acquire without consent of the owner any privately owned “improved property” or interests therein within the boundaries of the unit, so long as the appropriate local zoning agency (Shasta County), shall have in force and applicable to such property a duly adopted, valid, zoning ordinance that is approved by the Secretary. This suspension of the Secretary's authority to acquire “improved property” without the owner's consent would automatically cease: (1) If the property is made the subject to a variance or exception to any applicable zoning ordinance that does not conform to the applicable standards contained in the regulations in this part; or (2) if such property is put to any use which does not conform to any applicable zoning ordinance approved by the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(c) “Improved property” as used in this section, means any building or group of related buildings, the actual construction of which was begun before February 7, 1963, together with not more than 3 acres of land in the same ownership on which the building or group of buildings is situated, but the Secretary may exclude from such “improved property” any shore or waters, together with so much of the land adjoining such shore or waters, as he deems necessary for public access thereto.</P>

          <P>(d) The regulations in this part specify the standards with which local zoning ordinances for the Whiskeytown Unit must conform if the “improved property” within the boundaries of that unit is to be exempt from acquisition by condemnation. The objectives of the regulations in this part are to: (1) Prohibit new commercial or industrial uses other than those which the Secretary considers to be consistent with the purposes of the act establishing the national recreation area; (2) promote the protection and development of properties in keeping with the purposes of that act by means of use, acreage, frontage, setback, density, height, or other requirements; and (3) <PRTPAGE P="321"/>provide that the Secretary receive notice of any variance granted under, or any exception made to, the application of the zoning ordinance approved by him.</P>
          <P>(e) Following promulgation of the regulations in this part in final form, the Secretary is required to approve any zoning ordinance or any amendment to an approved zoning ordinance submitted to him which conforms to the standards contained in the regulations in this part in effect at the time of adoption of the ordinance or amendment. Within 60 days following submission, the county will be notified of the Secretary's approval or disapproval of the zoning ordinances or amendments thereto. If more than 60 days is required the county will be notified of the expected delay and of the additional time deemed necessary to reach a decision. The Secretary's approval shall remain effective so long as the zoning ordinances or amendments thereto remain in effect as approved.</P>
          <P>(f) Nothing contained in the regulations in this part or in the zoning ordinances or amendments adopted for the Whiskeytown Unit to implement the regulations in this part shall preclude the Secretary from exercising his power of condemnation at any time with respect to property other than “improved property” as defined herein. Nor shall the regulations in this part preclude the Secretary from otherwise fulfilling the responsibilities vested in him by the act authorizing establishment of the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area, by the Act of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535, 16 U.S.C. 3), as amended and supplemented, and such other statutory authorities relating to the National Park System.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 30.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Following issuance of the regulations in this part, Shasta County shall submit to the Secretary for his approval, all zoning ordinances and amendments thereto duly adopted by the county which are in force and applicable to property within the Whiskeytown Unit and which demonstrate conformity with the standards contained in the regulations in this part. This shall include any ordinances and amendments in effect prior to the issuance of the regulations in this part which demonstrate such conformity and any that have been adopted specifically to implement the regulations in this part.</P>
          <P>(b) Any new uses, and the location, design and scope of any new developments, permitted under the regulations in this part shall be harmonized with adjacent uses, developments and the natural features and shall be consistent with the current Master Plan proposed or adopted by the National Park Service for the Whiskeytown Unit, so as to minimize disruption of the natural scene and to further the public recreational purposes of the aforesaid establishment act for this unit.</P>

          <P>(c) Zoning ordinances for the districts hereinafter prescribed shall conform to the general and specific standards contained in the regulations in this part to assure that use and development of the lands within the Whiskeytown Unit are consistent with the objectives of the Congress to protect and preserve the values of the lands in such unit for public use and enjoyment, as set out in the Act of November 8, 1965 (79 Stat. 1295). Except as otherwise provided herein, no additional or increased commercial or industrial uses are permitted within these districts. Any existing nonconforming commercial or industrial uses shall be discontinued within 10 years from the date of this section: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That with the approval of the Secretary such 10-year period may be extended by the county for an additional period of time sufficient to allow the owner a reasonable opportunity to amortize investments made in the property before November 8, 1965.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 30.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Recreation District I.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Definition. This district shall comprise all those portions of the Whiskeytown Unit of the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area delineated as “Recreation District I” on a map bearing the identification NRA-WHI1000, and dated August 1966.</P>

          <P>(b) The following uses are permitted in Recreation District I provided the <PRTPAGE P="322"/>Shasta County Planning Commission has issued a use permit in each case:</P>
          <P>(1) Single-family dwellings, not including tents and trailers, but including servants' quarters in the same structure or in an accessory dwelling, and one noncommercial guest house. Such residential uses shall meet the following requirements:</P>
          <P>(i) Minimum building site area—3 acres; but a lesser acreage may be utilized for this purpose if, on or before February 7, 1963, the site was in separate ownership and within a recorded subdivision.</P>
          <P>(ii) Maximum building height—35 feet.</P>
          <P>(iii) Minimum frontage—150 feet.</P>
          <P>(iv) Minimum front yard setback—75 feet.</P>
          <P>(v) Minimum side yard setback—50 feet.</P>
          <P>(vi) Minimum rear yard setback—25 feet.</P>
          <P>(vii) Maximum percentage of lot coverage permitted—10 percent.</P>

          <P>(2) Moving, alteration, or improvement of existing residences or accessory structures provided there is compliance with the acreage, frontage, setback, density, height, and other requirements prescribed for residential uses under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, <E T="03">And provided, further,</E> That such moving alteration, or improvement does not alter the residential character of the premises. Any moving, alteration or improvement of such structures that would result in a deviation from these prescribed limitations and requirements would subject the property to acquisition without consent of the owner, unless the Secretary has waived such limitations or requirements.</P>
          <P>(3) Tree farming under a timber management plan that conforms to the California Forest Practices Act.</P>
          <P>(4) Riding stables.</P>
          <P>(5) Campgrounds, organizational camps and picnic areas.</P>
          <P>(6) Limited agricultural uses such as truck gardening, provided these uses do not require the extensive cutting or clearing of wooded areas and are not otherwise destructive of natural or recreational values.</P>
          <P>(7) Clearing and removal of trees, shrubbery, and other vegetation to the extent necessary in order to permit the exercise of a use otherwise allowed within this district.</P>
          <P>(8) Recreational pursuits such as horseshoe pitching, archery, croquet, tennis, softball, volley ball, and similar outdoor game-type activities compatible with the recreational purposes of the area.</P>
          <P>(9) Religious and educational uses.</P>
          <P>(10) Removal of gravel, sand, and rock or other alteration of the landscape to the minimum extent necessary for the construction of an access road to the property on which a use is permitted. In all other circumstances, such removal or alteration shall be permitted only to the minimum extent necessary to make possible the exercise of a use otherwise permitted in this district.</P>
          <P>(11) Signs that are appurtenant to any permitted use and which (i) do not exceed 1 square foot in area for any residential use; (ii) do not exceed 4 square feet in area for any other use, including advertisement of the sale or rental of property; and (iii) which are not illuminated by any neon or flashing device. Such signs may be placed only on the property on which the advertised use occurs, or on the property which is advertised for sale or rental. Signs shall be subdued in appearance, harmonizing in design and color with the surroundings and shall not be attached to any tree or shrub. Nonconforming signs may continue such nonconformity until they are destroyed, moved, structurally altered or redesigned, but the period of such nonconformity may not exceed 2 years from the date a zoning ordinance containing this limitation is adopted by Shasta County.</P>
          <P>(12) Accessory uses and temporary removable structures appurtenant to any permitted use.</P>

          <P>(c) Any use not included above as a permitted use shall be deemed a prohibited use. Moreover, all land within the boundaries of the Whiskeytown Unit, except certain “improved property” as defined herein, will be acquired by the United States as rapidly as appropriated funds are made available therefor and before any development occurs thereon. Any property <PRTPAGE P="323"/>that is developed before such acquisition takes place will be subject to acquisition by the Secretary without consent of the owner.</P>

          <P>(b) The following uses are permitted in Recreation District II:</P>

          <P>(viii) Accessory structures, facilities, and utilities as necessary to make possible the exercise of any use otherwise permitted.</P>
          <P>(c) Structures developed for the exercise of the additional uses listed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall not exceed two stories in height (35 feet), shall have a minimum principal use area of 5 acres, and shall have a front yard setback of not less than 100 feet from the nearest right-of-way line of a road or street.

          <P>(d) Any use not included above as a permitted use shall be deemed a prohibited use. Moreover, all land within the boundaries of the Whiskeytown Unit, except certain “improved property” as defined herein, will be acquired by the United States as rapidly as appropriated funds are made available therefor and before any development occurs thereon. Any property that is developed before such acquisition takes place will be subject to acquisition by the Secretary without consent of the owner.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 30.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Variances, exceptions, and use permits.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Zoning ordinances or amendments thereto, for the zoning districts comprising the Whiskeytown Unit of the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area may provide for the granting of variances and exceptions.</P>
          <P>(b) Zoning ordinances or amendments thereto for each of the districts established by the regulations in this part shall contain provisions advising applicants for variances and exceptions that, under section 2(f) of the Act of November 8, 1965, the authority of the Secretary to acquire “improved property” without the owner's consent would be reinstated (1) if such property is made the subject of a variance or exception to any applicable zoning ordinance that does not conform to any applicable standard contained in the regulations in this part; or (2) if such property is put to any use which does not conform to any applicable zoning ordinance approved by the Secretary.</P>

          <P>(c) The Shasta County Planning Commission, or private owners of “improved property” may consult the Secretary as to whether the grant of any proposed variance or exception would terminate the suspension of his authority to acquire the affected property without consent of the owner, and may request the approval of a variance or exception by the Secretary: <E T="03">Provided,</E> The Secretary is notified in writing at least 30 days in advance of the hearing on the application for the variance or exception. The Secretary within 30 days after the receipt of a request for approval of a variance or exception, <PRTPAGE P="324"/>shall advise the owner or the Commission whether or not the intended use will subject the property to acquisition by condemnation. If more than 30 days is required by the Secretary for such determination, he shall so notify the owner or Commission, stating the additional time required and the reasons therefor.</P>
          <P>(d) The Secretary shall be given written notice of any variance granted under, or exception made to the application of, a zoning ordinance or amendment thereof approved by him. The Secretary shall be provided a copy of every use permit granted by the Shasta County Planning Commission authorizing any use or development of lands within the boundaries of the Whiskeytown Unit of the recreation area.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What does this part cover?</SUBJECT>

            <P>This part covers the solicitation, award, and administration of concession contracts. The Director solicits, awards and administers concession contracts on behalf of the Secretary under the authority of the Act of August 25, 1916, as amended and supplemented, 16 U.S.C. 1 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and Title IV of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-391). The purpose of concession contracts is to authorize persons (concessioners) to provide visitor services in park areas. All concession contracts are to be consistent with the requirements of this part. In accordance with section 403 of the 1998 Act, the Director will utilize concession contracts to authorize the provision of visitor services in park areas, except as may otherwise be authorized by law. For example, the Director may enter into commercial use authorizations under section 418 of the 1998 Act and may enter into agreements with non-profit organizations for the sale of interpretive materials and conduct of interpretive programs for a fee or charge in park areas. In addition, the Director may, as part of an interpretive program agreement otherwise authorized by law, authorize a non-profit organization to provide incidental visitor services that are necessary for the conduct of the interpretive program. Nothing in this part <PRTPAGE P="330"/>amends, supersedes, or otherwise affects any provision of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) relating to revenue-producing visitor services.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the policy underlying concessions contracts?</SUBJECT>
            <P>It is the policy of the Congress and the Secretary that visitor services in park areas may be provided only under carefully controlled safeguards against unregulated and indiscriminate use so that visitation will not unduly impair park values and resources. Development of visitor services in park areas will be limited to locations that are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the park area. It is also the policy of the Congress and the Secretary of the Interior that development of visitor services in park areas must be limited to those as are necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the park area in which they are located.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How are terms defined in this part?</SUBJECT>
            <P>To understand this part, you must refer to these definitions, applicable in the singular or the plural, whenever these terms are used in this part:</P>
            <P>The <E T="03">1965 Act</E> means Public Law 89-249, commonly known as the National Park Service Concession Policies Act of 1965.</P>
            <P>A <E T="03">1965 Act concession contract</E> is a concession contract or permit entered into under the authority of the 1965 Act.</P>
            <P>The <E T="03">1998 Act</E> means Title IV of Public Law 105-391.</P>
            <P>The <E T="03">award</E> of a concession contract is the establishment of a legally binding concession contract. It occurs only when the Director and a selected offeror both fully execute a concession contract.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">A concession contract (or contract)</E> means a binding written agreement between the Director and a concessioner entered under the authority of this part or the 1965 Act that authorizes the concessioner to provide certain visitor services within a park area under specified terms and conditions. Concession contracts are not contracts within the meaning of 41 U.S.C. 601 <E T="03">et seq.</E> (the Contract Disputes Act) and are not service or procurement contracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or policies that apply only to federal service contracts or other types of federal procurement actions. Concession contracts will contain such terms and conditions as are required by this part or law and as are otherwise appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this part and the 1998 Act.</P>
            <P>A <E T="03">concessioner</E> is an individual, corporation, or other legally recognized entity that duly holds a concession contract.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Director</E> means the Director of the National Park Service (acting on behalf of the Secretary), or an authorized representative of the Director, except where a particular official is specifically identified in this part. In circumstances where this part calls for an appeal to the Director, the appeal shall be considered by an official of higher authority than the official that made the disputed decision.</P>
            <P>A <E T="03">franchise fee</E> is the consideration paid to the Director by a concessioner for the privileges granted by a concession contract.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Offeror</E> means an individual, corporation, or other legally recognized entity, including an existing concessioner, that submits a proposal for a concession contract. If the entity that is to be the concessioner is not formally in existence as of the time of submission of a proposal, a proposal must demonstrate that the individuals or organizations that intend to establish the entity that will become the concessioner have the ability and are legally obliged to cause the entity to be a qualified person as defined in this part. In addition, if the entity that will be the concessioner is not established at the time of submission of a proposal, the proposal must contain assurances satisfactory to the Director that the entity that will be the concessioner will be a qualified person as of the date of the award of the contract and otherwise have the ability to carry out the commitments made in the proposal.<PRTPAGE P="331"/>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Possessory interest</E> means an interest in real property improvements as defined by the 1965 Act obtained by a concessioner under a possessory interest concession contract. Possessory interest, for the purposes of this part, does not include any interest in property in which no possessory interest, as defined by the 1965 Act, exists.</P>
            <P>A <E T="03">possessory interest concession contract</E> means a 1965 Act concession contract that provides the concessioner a possessory interest.</P>
            <P>A <E T="03">preferred offeror</E> is a concessioner that the Director determines is eligible to exercise a right of preference to the award of a qualified concession contract in accordance with this part.</P>
            <P>A <E T="03">qualified concession contract</E> is a new concession contract that the Director determines to be a qualified concession contract for right of preference purposes.</P>
            <P>A <E T="03">qualified person</E> is an individual, corporation or other legally recognized entity that the Director determines has the experience and financial ability to satisfactorily carry out the terms of a concession contract. This experience and financial ability includes, but is not limited to, the ability to protect and preserve the resources of the park area and the ability to provide satisfactory visitor services at reasonable rates to the public.</P>
            <P>A <E T="03">responsive proposal</E> means a timely submitted proposal that is determined by the Director as agreeing to all of the minimum requirements of the proposed concession contract and prospectus and as having provided the information required by the prospectus.</P>
            <P>A <E T="03">right of preference</E> is the preferential right of renewal set forth in Section 403(7)(C) of the 1998 Act which requires the Director to allow a preferred offeror the opportunity to match the terms and conditions of a competing responsive proposal that the Director has determined to be the best proposal for a qualified concession contract. A right of preference does not provide any rights of any nature to establish or negotiate the terms and conditions of a concession contract to which a right of preference may apply.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Visitor services</E> means accommodations, facilities and services determined by the Director as necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of a park area provided to park area visitors for a fee or charge by a person other than the Director. The fee or charge paid by the visitor may be direct or indirect as part of the provision of comprehensive visitor services (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> when a lodging concessioner may provide free transportation services to guests). Visitor services may include, but are not limited to, lodging, campgrounds, food service, merchandising, tours, recreational activities, guiding, transportation, and equipment rental. Visitor services also include the sale of interpretive materials or the conduct of interpretive programs for a fee or charge to visitors.</P>

            <P>The Director may specify in a prospectus additional solicitation and/or selection procedures consistent with the requirements of this part in the interest of enhancing competition. Such additional procedures may include, but are not limited to, issuance of a two-phased prospectus—a qualifications phase and a proposal phase. The Director will incorporate simplified administrative requirements and procedures in prospectuses for concession contracts that the Director considers are likely to be awarded to a sole proprietorship or are likely to have annual gross receipts of less than $100,000. Such simplified requirements and procedures may include, as appropriate and without limitation, a reduced application package, a shorter proposal submission period, and a reduction of proposal information requirements.</P>

            <SUBJECT>May I clarify, amend or supplement my proposal after it is submitted?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Director may request from any offeror who has submitted a timely proposal a written clarification of its proposal. Clarification refers to making clear any ambiguities that may have been contained in a proposal but does not include amendment or supplementation of a proposal. An offeror may not amend or supplement a proposal after the submission date unless requested by the Director to do so and the Director provides all offerors that submitted proposals a similar opportunity to amend or supplement their proposals. Permitted amendments must be limited to modifying particular aspects of proposals resulting from a general failure of offerors to understand particular requirements of a prospectus or a general failure of offerors to submit particular information required by a prospectus.</P>
            <P>(b) A proposal may suggest changes to the terms and conditions of a proposed concession contract and still be considered as responsive so long as the suggested changes are not conditions to acceptance of the terms and conditions of the proposed concession contract. The fact that a proposal may suggest changes to the proposed concession contract does not mean that the Director may accept those changes without a resolicitation of the concession opportunity.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 51.16</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How will the Director evaluate proposals and select the best one?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Director will apply the selection factors set forth in § 51.17 by assessing each timely proposal under each of the selection factors on the basis of a narrative explanation, discussing any subfactors when applicable. For each selection factor, the Director will assign a score that reflects the determined merits of the proposal under the applicable selection factor and in comparison to the other proposals received, if any. The first four principal selection factors will be scored from zero to five. The fifth selection factor will be scored from zero to four (with a score of one for agreeing to the minimum franchise fee contained in the prospectus). The secondary factor set forth in § 51.17(b)(1) will be scored from zero to three. Any additional secondary selection factors set forth in the prospectus will be scored as specified in the prospectus provided that the aggregate possible point score for all additional secondary selection factors may not exceed a total of three.</P>
            <P>(b) The Director will then assign a cumulative point score to each proposal based on the assigned score for each selection factor.</P>
            <P>(c) The responsive proposal with the highest cumulative point score will be selected by the Director as the best proposal. If two or more responsive proposals receive the same highest point score, the Director will select as the best proposal (from among the responsive proposals with the same highest point score), the responsive proposal that the Director determines on the basis of a narrative explanation will, on an overall basis, best achieve the purposes of this part. Consideration of revenue to the United States in this determination and in scoring proposals under principal selection factor five will be subordinate to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving the resources of the park area and of providing necessary and appropriate visitor services to the public at reasonable rates.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the selection factors?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The five principal selection factors are:</P>
            <P>(1) The responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives, as described in the prospectus, of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the park area;</P>
            <P>(2) The responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives, as described in the prospectus, of providing necessary and appropriate visitor services at reasonable rates;</P>
            <P>(3) The experience and related background of the offeror, including the past performance and expertise of the offeror in providing the same or similar visitor services as those to be provided under the concession contract;</P>
            <P>(4) The financial capability of the offeror to carry out its proposal; and</P>
            <P>(5) The amount of the proposed minimum franchise fee, if any, and/or other forms of financial consideration to the Director.

            <SUBJECT>What happens to a right of preference in the event of termination of a concession contract for unsatisfactory performance or other breach?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Nothing in this part will limit the right of the Director to terminate a concession contract pursuant to its terms at any time for less than satisfactory performance or otherwise. If a concession contract is terminated for less than satisfactory performance or other breach, the terminated concessioner, even if otherwise qualified, will not be eligible to be a preferred offeror. The fact that the Director may not have terminated a concession contract for less than satisfactory performance or other breach will not limit the authority of the Director to determine that a concessioner did not operate satisfactorily on an overall basis during the term of a concession contract.</P>

            <P>In case of a dispute between a new concessioner and a prior concessioner as to the value of the prior concessioner's possessory interest, the dispute will be resolved under the procedures contained in the possessory interest concession contract. A new concessioner will not agree on the value of a prior concessioner's possessory interest without the prior written approval of the Director unless the value is determined through the binding determination process required by the possessory interest concession contract. The Director's written approval is to ensure that the value is consistent with the terms and conditions of the possessory interest concession contract. If a new concessioner and a prior concessioner engage in a binding process to resolve a dispute as to the value of the prior concessioner's possessory interest, the new concessioner must allow the Director to assist the new concessioner in the dispute process to the extent requested by the Director. Nothing in this section may be construed as limiting the rights of the prior concessioner to be paid for its possessory interest or other property by a new concessioner in accordance with the terms of its concession contract.</P>

            <SUBJECT>If a concessioner under a 1965 Act concession contract is awarded a new concession contract, what happens to the concessioner's possessory interest?</SUBJECT>
            <P>In the event a concessioner under a 1965 Act concession contract is awarded a new concession contract replacing a possessory interest concession contract, the concessioner will obtain a leasehold surrender interest in its existing possessory interest real property improvements under the terms of the new concession contract. The concessioner will carry over as the initial value of such leasehold surrender interest (instead of initial construction cost) an amount equal to the value of its possessory interest in real property improvements as of the expiration or other termination of its possessory interest contract. This leasehold surrender interest will apply to the concessioner's possessory interest in real property improvements even if the real property improvements are not capital improvements as defined in this part. In the event that the concessioner had a possessory interest in only a portion of a structure, depreciation for purposes of leasehold surrender interest value under the new concession contract will apply only to the portion of the structure to which the possessory interest applied. The concessioner and the Director will seek to agree on an allocation of the leasehold surrender interest value on a unit by unit basis.</P>

            <P>If a new concessioner is awarded a leasehold surrender interest concession contract and is required to pay a prior concessioner for possessory interest in real property improvements, the new concessioner will have a leasehold surrender interest in the real property improvements under the terms of its new concession contract. The initial value of the leasehold surrender interest (instead of initial construction cost) will be the value of the possessory interest as of the expiration or other termination of the 1965 Act possessory interest concession contract. This leasehold surrender interest will apply even if the related possessory interest real property improvements are not capital improvements as defined in this part. In the event a new concessioner obtains a leasehold surrender interest in only a portion of a structure as a result of the acquisition of a possessory interest from a prior concessioner, depreciation for purposes of leasehold surrender interest value will apply only to the portion of the structure to which the possessory interest applied.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the term of a concession contract?</SUBJECT>
            <P>A concession contract will generally be awarded for a term of 10 years or less unless the Director determines that the contract terms and conditions, including the required construction of capital improvements, warrant a longer term. It is the policy of the Director under these requirements that the term of concession contracts should be as short as is prudent, taking into account the financial requirements of the concession contract, resource protection and visitor needs, and other factors the Director may deem appropriate. In no event will a concession contract have a term of more than 20 years (unless extended in accordance with this part).</P>

            <P>The Director may not include a provision in a concession contract or otherwise grant a concessioner a preferential right to provide new or additional visitor services under the terms of a concession contract or otherwise. For the purpose of this section, a “preferential right to new or additional services” means a right of a concessioner to a preference (in the nature of a right of first refusal or otherwise) to provide new or additional visitor services in a park area beyond those already provided by the concessioner under the terms of a concession contract. A concession contract may be amended to authorize the concessioner to provide minor additional visitor services that are a reasonable extension of the existing services. A concessioner that is allocated park area entrance, user days or similar resource use allocations for the purposes of a concession contract will not obtain any contractual or other rights to continuation of a particular allocation level pursuant to the terms of a concession contract or otherwise. Such allocations will be made, withdrawn and/or adjusted by the Director from time to time in furtherance of the purposes of this part.</P>

            <P>(a) Concession contracts will provide for payment to the government of a franchise fee or other monetary consideration as determined by the Director upon consideration of the probable value to the concessioner of the privileges granted by the contract involved. This probable value will be based upon a reasonable opportunity for net profit in relation to capital invested and the obligations of the contract. Consideration of revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to the objectives of protecting and preserving park areas and of providing necessary and appropriate visitor services at reasonable rates.</P>

            <P>(b) The franchise fee contained in a concession contract with a term of 5 years or less may not be adjusted during the term of the contract. Concession contracts with a term of more than 5 years will contain a provision that provides for adjustment of the contract's established franchise fee at the request of the concessioner or the Director. An adjustment will occur if the concessioner and the Director mutually determine that extraordinary, unanticipated changes occurred after the effective date of the contract that <PRTPAGE P="350"/>have affected or will significantly affect the probable value of the privileges granted by the contract.

In establishing these comparable franchise fees, the Director will take into account, as appropriate, variations in the nature and type of visitor services authorized by particular concession contracts, including, but not limited to, length of the visitor experience, type of equipment utilized, relative expense levels, and other relevant factors. The terms and conditions of an existing concession contract will not be subject to modification or open to renegotiation by the Director because of the award of a new concession contract at the same approximate location or utilizing the same resource.</P>

The construction of capital improvements will be undertaken only pursuant to the leasehold surrender interest provisions of this part and the applicable concession contract.</P>
            <P>(b) Concession contracts may contain provisions that require the concessioner to set aside a percentage of its gross receipts or other funds in a repair and maintenance reserve to be used at the direction of the Director solely for maintenance and repair of real property improvements located in park areas and utilized by the concessioner in its operations. Repair and maintenance reserve funds may not be expended to construct real property improvements, including, without limitation, capital improvements. Repair and maintenance reserve provisions may not be included in concession contracts in lieu of a franchise fee, and funds from the reserves will be expended only for the repair and maintenance of real property improvements assigned to the concessioner by the Director for use in its operations.</P>
            <P>(c) A concession contract must require the concessioner to maintain in good condition through a comprehensive repair and maintenance program all of the concessioner's personal property used in the performance of the concession contract and all real property improvements, including, without limitation, capital improvements, and, government personal property, assigned to the concessioner by a concession contract.</P>

            <P>(b) Unless otherwise provided in a concession contract, the reasonableness of a concessioner's rates and charges to the public will be determined primarily by comparison with those rates and charges for facilities and services of comparable character under similar conditions, with due consideration of the following factors and other factors deemed relevant by the Director: Length of season; peakloads; average percentage of occupancy; accessibility; availability and costs of labor and materials; and types of patronage. Such rates and charges may not exceed the market rates and charges for comparable facilities, goods, and services, after taking these factors into consideration.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Did the 1998 Act repeal the 1965 Act?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Section 415 of the 1998 Act repealed the 1965 Act and related laws as of November 13, 1998. This repeal did not affect the validity of any 1965 Act concession contract. The provisions of this part apply to all 1965 Act concession contracts except to the extent that such provisions are inconsistent with terms and conditions of a 1965 Act concession contract.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 51.102</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What is the effect of the 1998 Act's repeal of the 1965 Act's preference in renewal?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Section 5 of the 1965 Act required the Secretary to give existing satisfactory concessioners a preference in the renewal (termed a “renewal preference” in the rest of this section) of its concession contract or permit. Section 415 of the 1998 Act repealed this statutory renewal preference as of November 13, 1998. It is the final decision of the Director, subject to the right of appeal set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, that holders of 1965 Act concession contracts are not entitled to be given a renewal preference with respect to such contracts (although they may otherwise qualify for a right of preference regarding such contracts under Sections 403(7) and (8) of the 1998 Act as implemented in this part). However, if a concessioner holds an existing 1965 Act concession contract and the contract makes express reference to a renewal preference, the concessioner may appeal to the Director for recognition of a renewal preference.</P>

            <P>(b) Such appeal must be in writing and be received by the Director no later than thirty days after the issuance of a prospectus for a concession contract under this part for which <PRTPAGE P="356"/>the concessioner asserts a renewal preference. The Director must make a decision on the appeal prior to the proposal submission date specified in the prospectus. Where applicable, the Director will give notice of this appeal to all potential offerors that requested a prospectus. The Director may delegate consideration of such appeals only to a Deputy or Associate Director. The deciding official must prepare a written decision on the appeal, taking into account the content of the appeal and other available information.</P>
            <P>(c) If the appeal results in a determination by the Director that the 1965 Act concession contract in question makes express reference to a renewal preference under section 5 of the 1965 Act, the 1998 Act's repeal of section 5 of the 1965 Act was inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the concession contract, and that the holder of the concession contract in these circumstances is entitled to a renewal preference by operation of law, the Director will permit the concessioner to exercise a renewal preference for the contract subject to and in accordance with the otherwise applicable right of preference terms and conditions of this part, including, without limitation, the requirement for submission of a responsive proposal pursuant to the terms of an applicable prospectus. The Director, similarly, will permit any holder of a 1965 Act concession contract that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final order is entitled to a renewal preference, for any reason, to exercise a right of preference in accordance with the otherwise applicable requirements of this part, including, without limitation, the requirement for submission of a responsive proposal pursuant to the terms of an applicable prospectus.</P>

          <P>These post-completion responsibilities apply to each area or facility for which Land and Water Conservation Fund (L&amp;WCF) assistance is obtained, regardless of the extent of participation of the program in the assisted area or facility and consistent with the contractural agreement between NPS and the State. Responsibility for compliance and enforcement of these provisions rests with the State for both State and locally sponsored projects. The responsibilities cited herein are <PRTPAGE P="357"/>applicable to the area depicted or otherwise described on the 6(f)(3) boundary map and/or as described in other project documentation approved by the Department of the Interior. In many instances, this mutually agreed to area exceeds that actually receiving L&amp;WCF assistance so as to assure the protection of a viable recreation entity. For leased sites assisted under L&amp;WCF, compliance with post-completion requirements of the grant ceases following lease expiration unless the grant agreement calls for some other arrangement.</P>

          <P>The information collection requirements contained in § 59.3 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and assigned clearance number 1024-0047. The information is being collected to determine whether to approve a project sponsor's request to convert an assisted site or facility to other than public outdoor recreation uses. The information will be used to assure that the requirements of section 6(f)(3) of the L&amp;WCF Act would be met should the proposed conversion be implemented. Response is required in order to obtain the benefit of Department of the Interior approval.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 59.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Conversion requirements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Background and legal requirements.</E> Section 6(f)(3) of the L&amp;WCF Act is the cornerstone of Federal compliance efforts to ensure that the Federal investments in L&amp;WCF assistance are being maintained in public outdoor recreation use. This section of the Act assures that once an area has been funded with L&amp;WCF assistance, it is continually maintained in public recreation use unless NPS approves substitution property of reasonably equivalent usefulness and location and of at least equal fair market value.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Prerequisites for conversion approval.</E> Requests from the project sponsor for permission to convert L&amp;WCF assisted properties in whole or in part to other than public outdoor recreation uses must be submitted by the State Liaison Officer to the appropriate NPS Regional Director in writing. NPS will consider conversion requests if the following prerequisites have been met:</P>
          <P>(1) All practical alternatives to the proposed conversion have been evaluated.</P>
          <P>(2) The fair market value of the property to be converted has been established and the property proposed for substitution is of at least equal fair market value as established by an approved appraisal (prepared in accordance with uniform Federal appraisal standards) excluding the value of structures or facilities that will not serve a recreation purpose.</P>
          <P>(3) The property proposed for replacement is of reasonably equivalent usefulness and location as that being converted. Dependent upon the situation and at the discretion of the Regional Director, the replacement property need not provide identical recreation experiences or be located at the same site, provided it is in a reasonably equivalent location. Generally, the replacement property should be administered by the same political jurisdiction as the converted property. NPS will consider State requests to change the project sponsor when it is determined that a different political jurisdiction can better carry out the objectives of the original project agreement. Equivalent usefulness and location will be determined based on the following criteria:</P>

          <P>(i) Property to be converted must be evaluated in order to determine what recreation needs are being fulfilled by the facilities which exist and the types of outdoor recreation resources and opportunities available. The property being proposed for substitution must then be evaluated in a similar manner to determine if it will meet recreation needs which are at least like in magnitude and impact to the user community as the converted site. This criterion is applicable in the consideration of all conversion requests with the exception of those where wetlands are proposed as replacement property. Wetland areas and interests therein which have been identified in the wetlands provisions of the Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan shall be considered to be of reasonably equivalent usefulness with the property proposed for conversion regardless <PRTPAGE P="358"/>of the nature of the property proposed for conversion.</P>
          <P>(ii) Replacement property need not necessarily be directly adjacent to or close by the converted site. This policy provides the administrative flexibility to determine location recognizing that the property should meet existing public outdoor recreation needs. While generally this will involve the selection of a site serving the same community(ies) or area as the converted site, there may be exceptions. For example, if property being converted is in an area undergoing major demographic change and the area has no existing or anticipated future need for outdoor recreation, then the project sponsor should seek to locate the substitute area in another location within the jurisdiction. Should a local project sponsor be unable to replace converted property, the State would be responsible, as the primary recipient of Federal assistance, for assuring compliance with these regulations and the substitution of replacement property.</P>
          <P>(iii) The acquisition of one parcel of land may be used in satisfaction of several approved conversions.</P>

          <P>(4) The property proposed for substitution meets the eligibility requirements for L&amp;WCF assisted acquisition. The replacement property must constitute or be part of a viable recreation area. Unless <E T="03">each</E> of the following additional conditions is met, land currently in public ownership, including that which is owned by another public agency, may not be used as replacement land for land acquired as part of an L&amp;WCF project:</P>
          <P>(i) The land was not acquired by the sponsor or selling agency for recreation.</P>
          <P>(ii) The land has not been dedicated or managed for recreational purposes while in public ownership.</P>
          <P>(iii) No Federal assistance was provided in the original acquisition unless the assistance was provided under a program expressly authorized to match or supplement L&amp;WCF assistance.</P>
          <P>(iv) Where the project sponsor acquires the land from another public agency, the selling agency must be required by law to receive payment for the land so acquired.</P>
          <FP>In the case of development projects for which the State match was not derived from the cost of the purchase or value of a donation of the land to be converted, but from the value of the development itself, public land which has not been dedicated or managed for recreation/conservation use may be used as replacement land even if this land is transferred from one public agency to another without cost.</FP>
          <P>(5) In the case of assisted sites which are partially rather than wholly converted, the impact of the converted portion on the remainder shall be considered. If such a conversion is approved, the unconverted area must remain recreationally viable or be replaced as well.</P>
          <P>(6) All necessary coordination with other Federal agencies has been satisfactorily accomplished including, for example, compliance with section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966.</P>
          <P>(7) The guidelines for environmental evaluation have been satisfactorily completed and considered by NPS during its review of the proposed 6(f)(3) action. In cases where the proposed conversion arises from another Federal action, final review of the State's proposal shall not occur until the NPS Regional office is assured that all environmental review requirements related to that other action have been met.</P>
          <P>(8) State intergovernmental clearinghouse review procedures have been adhered to if the proposed conversion and substitution constitute significant changes to the original Land and Water Conservation Fund project.</P>
          <P>(9) The proposed conversion and substitution are in accord with the Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP) and/or equivalent recreation plans.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendments for conversion.</E> All conversions require amendments to the original project agreements. Therefore, amendment requests should be submitted concurrently with conversion requests or at such time as all details of the conversion have been worked out with NPS. Section 6(f)(3) project boundary maps shall be submitted with the amendment request to identify the changes to the original area caused by <PRTPAGE P="359"/>the proposed conversion and to establish a new project area pursuant to the substitution. Once the conversion has been approved, replacement property should be immediately acquired. Exceptions to this rule would occur only when it is not possible for replacement property to be identified prior to the State's request for a conversion. In such cases, an express commitment to satisfy section 6(f)(3) substitution requirements within a specified period, normally not to exceed one year following conversion approval, must be received from the State. This commitment will be in the form of an amendment to the grant agreement.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Obsolete facilities.</E> Recipients are not required to continue operation of a particular facility beyond its useful life. However, when a facility is declared obsolete, the site must nonetheless be maintained for public outdoor recreation following discontinuance of the assisted facility. Failure to so maintain is considered to be a conversion. Requests regarding changes from a L&amp;WCF funded facility to another otherwise eligible facility at the same site that significantly contravene the original plans for the area must be made in writing to the Regional Director. NPS approval must be obtained prior to the occurrence of the change. NPS approval is not necessarily required, however, for each and every facility use change. Rather, a project area should be viewed in the context of overall use and should be monitored in this context. A change from a baseball field to a football field, for example, would not require NPS approval. A change from a swimming pool with substantial recreational development to a less intense area of limited development such as a passive park, or vice versa, would, however, require NPS review and approval. To assure that facility changes do not significantly contravene the original project agreement, NPS shall be notified by the State of <E T="03">all</E> proposed changes in advance of their occurrence. A primary NPS consideration in the review of requests for changes in use will be the consistency of the proposal with the Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan and/or equivalent recreation plans. Changes to other than public outdoor recreation use require NPS approval and the substitution of replacement land in accordance with section 6(f)(3) of the L&amp;WCF Act and paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Residency requirements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Background.</E> Section 6(f)(8) of the L&amp;WCF Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of residence, including preferential reservation or membership systems, except to the extent that reasonable differences in admission and other fees may be maintained on such basis. This prohibition applies to both regularly scheduled and special events. The general provisions regarding non-discrimination at sites assisted under Interior programs and, thereby, all other recreation facilities managed by a project sponsor, are covered in 43 CFR part 17 which implements the provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for the Department.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Policy.</E> There shall be no discrimination for L&amp;WCF assisted programs and services on the basis of residence, except in reasonable fee differentials. Post-completion compliance responsibilities of the recipient should continue to ensure that discrimination on the basis of residency is not occurring.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees.</E> Fees charged to nonresidents cannot exceed twice that charged to residents. Where there is no charge for residents but a fee is charged to nonresidents, nonresident fees cannot exceed fees charged for residents at comparable State or local public facilities. Reservation, membership, or annual permit systems available to residents must also be available to nonresidents and the period of availability must be the same for both residents and nonresidents. Recipients are prohibited from providing residents the option of purchasing annual or daily permits while at the same time restricting nonresidents to the purchase of annual permits only. These provisions apply only to the approved 6(f)(3) areas applicable to the recipient. Nonresident fishing and hunting license fees are excluded from these requirements.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Authorization and expansion of the National Register.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 80 Stat. 915, 16 U.S.C. 470 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> as amended, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to expand and maintain a National Register of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering and culture. The regulations herein set forth the procedural requirements for listing properties on the National Register.</P>
          <P>(b) Properties are added to the National Register through the following processes.</P>
          <P>(1) Those Acts of Congress and Executive orders which create historic areas of the National Park System administered by the National Park Service, all or portions of which may be determined to be of historic significance consistent with the intent of Congress;</P>
          <P>(2) Properties declared by the Secretary of the Interior to be of national significance and designated as National Historic Landmarks;</P>
          <P>(3) Nominations prepared under approved State Historic Preservation Programs, submitted by the State Historic Preservation Officer and approved by the NPS;</P>
          <P>(4) Nominations from any person or local government (only if such property is located in a State with no approved State Historic Preservation Program) approved by the NPS and;</P>
          <P>(5) Nominations of Federal properties prepared by Federal agencies, submitted by the Federal Preservation Officer and approved by NPS.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Effects of listing under Federal law.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The National Register is an authoritative guide to be used by Federal, State, and local governments, private groups and citizens to identify the Nation's cultural resources and to indicate what properties should be considered for protection from destruction or impairment. Listing of private property on the National Register does not prohibit under Federal law or regulation any actions which may otherwise be taken by the property owner with respect to the property.</P>

          <P>(a) The National Register was designed to be and is administered as a planning tool. Federal agencies undertaking a project having an effect on a listed or eligible property must provide the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment pursuant to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. The Council has adopted procedures concerning, <E T="03">inter alia,</E> their commenting responsibility in 36 CFR part 800. Having complied with this procedural requirement the Federal agency may adopt any course of action it believes is appropriate. While the Advisory Council comments must be taken into account and integrated into the decisionmaking process, program decisions rest with the agency implementing the undertaking.</P>
          <P>(b) Listing in the National Register also makes property owners eligible to be considered for Federal grants-in-aid for historic preservation.</P>

          <P>(c) If a property is listed in the National Register, certain provisions of <PRTPAGE P="361"/>the Tax Reform Act of 1976 as amended by the Revenue Act of 1978 and the Tax Treatment Extension Act of 1980 may apply. These provisions encourage the preservation of depreciable historic structures by allowing favorable tax treatments for rehabilitation, and discourage destruction of historic buildings by eliminating certain otherwise available Federal tax provisions both for demolition of historic structures and for new construction on the site of demolished historic buildings. Owners of historic buildings may benefit from the investment tax credit provisions of the Revenue Act of 1978. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 generally replaces the rehabilitation tax incentives under these laws beginning January 1, 1982 with a 25% investment tax credit for rehabilitations of historic commercial, industrial and residential buildings. This can be combined with a 15-year cost recovery period for the adjusted basis of the historic building. Historic buildings with certified rehabilitations receive additional tax savings by their exemption from any requirement to reduce the basis of the building by the amount of the credit. The denial of accelerated depreciation for a building built on the site of a demolished historic building is repealed effective January 1, 1982. The Tax Treatment Extension Act of 1980 includes provisions regarding charitable contributions for conservation purposes of partial interests in historically important land areas or structures.</P>
          <P>(d) If a property contains surface coal resources and is listed in the National Register, certain provisions of the Surface Mining and Control Act of 1977 require consideration of a property's historic values in the determination on issuance of a surface coal mining permit.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Criteria for evaluation.</SUBJECT>

          <P>The criteria applied to evaluate properties (other than areas of the National Park System and National Historic Landmarks) for the National Register are listed below. These criteria are worded in a manner to provide for a wide diversity of resources. The following criteria shall be used in evaluating properties for nomination to the National Register, by NPS in reviewing nominations, and for evaluating National Register eligibility of properties. Guidance in applying the criteria is further discussed in the “How To” publications, Standards &amp; Guidelines sheets and Keeper's opinions of the National Register. Such materials are available upon request.

              <E T="03">National Register criteria for evaluation.</E> The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association and</P>
            <P>(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or</P>
            <P>(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or</P>
            <P>(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or</P>
            <P>(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Criteria considerations.</E> Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years shall not be considered eligible for the National Register. However, such properties will qualify if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria of if they fall within the following categories:</P>
            <P>(a) A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance; or</P>

            <P>(b) A building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant primarily for architectural value, or which is <PRTPAGE P="364"/>the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic person or event; or</P>
            <P>(c) A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no appropriate site or building directly associated with his productive life.</P>
            <P>(d) A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events; or</P>
            <P>(e) A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with the same association has survived; or</P>
            <P>(f) A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional significance; or</P>
            <P>(g) A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Nominations by the State Historic Preservation Officer under approved State Historic Preservation programs.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The State Historic Preservation Officer is responsible for identifying and nominating eligible properties to the National Register. Nomination forms are prepared under the supervision of the State Historic Preservation Officer. The State Historic Preservation Officer establishes statewide priorities for preparation and submittal of nominations for all properties meeting National Register criteria for evaluation within the State. All nominations from the State shall be submitted in accord with the State priorities, which shall be consistent with an approved State historic preservation plan.</P>
          <P>(b) The State shall consult with local authorities in the nomination process. The State provides notice of the intent to nominate a property and solicits written comments especially on the significance of the property and whether or not it meets the National Register criteria for evaluation. The State notice also gives owners of private property an opportunity to concur in or object to listing. The notice is carried out as specified in the subsections below.</P>
          <P>(c) As part of the nomination process, each State is required to notify in writing the property owner(s), except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, of the State's intent to bring the nomination before the State Review Board. The list of owners shall be obtained from either official land recordation records or tax records, whichever is more appropriate, within 90 days prior to the notification of intent to nominate. If in any State the land recordation or tax records is not the most appropriate list from which to obtain owners that State shall notify the Keeper in writing and request approval that an alternative source of owners may be used.</P>

          <FP>The State is responsible for notifying only those owners whose names appear on the list consulted. Where there is more than one owner on the list, each separate owner shall be notified. The State shall send the written notification at least 30 but not more than 75 <PRTPAGE P="365"/>days before the State Review Board meeting. Required notices may vary in some details of wording as the States prefer, but the content of notices must be approved by the National Register. The notice shall give the owner(s) at least 30 but not more than 75 days to submit written comments and concur in or object in writing to the nomination of such property. At least 30 but not more than 75 days before the State Review Board meeting, the States are also required to notify by the above mentioned National Register approved notice the applicable chief elected official of the county (or equivalent governmental unit) and municipal political jurisdiction in which the property is located. The National Register nomination shall be on file with the State Historic Preservation Program during the comment period and a copy made available by mail when requested by the public, or made available at a location of reasonable access to all affected property owners, such as a local library courthouse, or other public place, prior to the State Review Board meeting so that written comments regarding the nomination can be prepared.</FP>
          <P>(d) For a nomination with more than 50 property owners, each State is required to notify in writing at least 30 but not more than 75 days in advance of the State Review Board meeting the chief elected local officials of the county (or equivalent governmental unit) and municipal political jurisdiction in which the property or district is located. The State shall provide general notice to property owners concerning the State's intent to nominate. The general notice shall be published at least 30 days but not more than 75 days before the State Review Board meeting and provide an opportunity for the submission of written comments and provide the owners of private property or a majority of such owners for districts an opportunity to concur in or object in writing to the nomination. Such general notice must be published in one or more local newspapers of general circulation in the area of the nomination. The content of the notices shall be approved by the National Register. If such general notice is used to notify the property owners for a nomination containing more than 50 owners, it is suggested that a public information meeting be held in the immediate area prior to the State Review Board meeting. If the State wishes to individually notify all property owners, it may do so, pursuant to procedures specified in subsection 60.6(c), in which case, the State need not publish a general notice.</P>
          <P>(e) For Multiple Resource and Thematic Group Format submission, each district, site, building, structure and object included in the submission is treated as a separate nomination for the purpose of notification and to provide owners of private property the opportunity to concur in or object in writing to the nomination in accord with this section.</P>
          <P>(f) The commenting period following notifications can be waived only when all property owners and the chief elected local official have advised the State in writing that they agree to the waiver.</P>

          <P>(g) Upon notification, any owner or owners of a private property who wish to object shall submit to the State Historic Preservation Officer a notarized statement certifying that the party is the sole or partial owner of the private property, as appropriate, and objects to the listing. In nominations with multiple ownership of a single private property or of districts, the property will not be listed if a majority of the owners object to listing. Upon receipt of notarized objections respecting a district or single private property with multiple owners, it is the responsibility of the State Historic Preservation Officer to ascertain whether a majority of owners of private property have objected. If an owner whose name did not appear on the list certifies in a written notarized statement that the party is the sole or partial owner of a nominated private property such owner shall be counted by the State Historic Preservation Officer in determining whether a majority of owners has objected. Each owner of private property in a district has one vote regardless of how many properties or what part of one property that party owns and regardless of whether the property contributes to the significance of the district.<PRTPAGE P="366"/>
          </P>
          <P>(h) If a property has been submitted to and approved by the State Review Board for inclusion in the National Register prior to the effective date of this section, the State Historic Preservation Officer need not resubmit the property to the State Review Board; but before submitting the nomination to the NPS shall afford owners of private property the opportunity to concur in or object to the property's inclusion in the Register pursuant to applicable notification procedures described above.</P>
          <P>(i) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(j) Completed nomination forms or the documentation proposed for submission on the nomination forms and comments concerning the significance of a property and its eligibility for the National Register are submitted to the State Review Board. The State Review Board shall review the nomination forms or documentation proposed for submission on the nomination forms and any comments concerning the property's significance and eligibility for the National Register. The State Review Board shall determine whether or not the property meets the National Register criteria for evaluation and make a recommendation to the State Historic Preservation Officer to approve or disapprove the nomination.</P>
          <P>(k) Nominations approved by the State Review Board and comments received are then reviewed by the State Historic Preservation Officer and if he or she finds the nominations to be adequately documented and technically, professionally, and procedurally correct and sufficient and in conformance with National Register criteria for evaluation, the nominations are submitted to the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240. All comments received by a State and notarized statements of objection to listing are submitted with a nomination.</P>
          <P>(l) If the State Historic Preservation Officer and the State Review Board disagree on whether a property meets the National Register criteria for evaluation, the State Historic Preservation Officer, if he or she chooses, may submit the nomination with his or her opinion concerning whether or not the property meets the criteria for evaluation and the opinion of the State Review Board to the Keeper of the National Register for a final decision on the listing of the property. The opinion of the State Review Board may be the minutes of the Review Board meeting. The State Historic Preservation Officer shall submit such disputed nominations if so requested within 45 days of the State Review Board meeting by the State Review Board or the chief elected local official of the local, county or municipal political subdivision in which the property is located but need not otherwise do so. Such nominations will be substantively reviewed by the Keeper.</P>
          <P>(m) The State Historic Preservation Officer shall also submit to the Keeper nominations if so requested under the appeals process in § 60.12.</P>
          <P>(n) If the owner of a private property or the majority of such owners for a district or single property with multiple owners have objected to the nomination prior to the submittal of a nomination, the State Historic Preservation Officer shall submit the nomination to the Keeper only for a determination of eligibility pursuant to subsection (s) of this section.</P>
          <P>(o) The State Historic Preservation Officer signs block 12 of the nomination form if in his or her opinion the property meets the National Register criteria for evaluation. The State Historic Preservation Officer's signature in block 12 certifies that:</P>
          <P>(1) All procedural requirements have been met;</P>
          <P>(2) The nomination form is adequately documented;</P>
          <P>(3) The nomination form is technically and professionally correct and sufficient;</P>
          <P>(4) In the opinion of the State Historic Preservation Officer, the property meets the National Register criteria for evaluation.</P>

          <P>(p) When a State Historic Preservation Officer submits a nomination form for a property that he or she does not believe meets the National Register <PRTPAGE P="367"/>criteria for evaluation, the State Historic Preservation Officer signs a continuation sheet Form NPS 10-900a explaining his/her opinions on the eligibility of the property and certifying that:</P>
          <P>(1) All procedural requirements have been met;</P>
          <P>(2) The nomination form is adequately documented;</P>
          <P>(3) The nomination form is technically and professionally correct and sufficient.</P>
          <P>(q) Notice will be provided in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that the nominated property is being considered for listing in the National Register of Historic Places as specified in § 60.13.</P>
          <P>(r) Nominations will be included in the National Register within 45 days of receipt by the Keeper or designee unless the Keeper disapproves a nomination, an appeal is filed, or the owner of private property (or the majority of such owners for a district or single property with multiple owners) objects by notarized statements received by the Keeper prior to listing. Nominations which are technically or professionally inadequate will be returned for correction and resubmission. When a property does not appear to meet the National Register criteria for evaluation, the nomination will be returned with an explanation as to why the property does not meet the National Register criteria for evaluation.</P>
          <P>(s) If the owner of private property (or the majority of such owners for a district or single property with multiple owners) has objected to the nomination by notarized statement prior to listing, the Keeper shall review the nomination and make a determination of eligibility within 45 days of receipt, unless an appeal is filed. The Keeper shall list such properties determined eligible in the National Register upon receipt of notarized statements from the owner(s) of private property that the owner(s) no longer object to listing.</P>
          <P>(t) Any person or organization which supports or opposes the nomination of a property by a State Historic Preservation Officer may petition the Keeper during the nomination process either to accept or reject a nomination. The petitioner must state the grounds of the petition and request in writing that the Keeper substantively review the nomination. Such petitions received by the Keeper prior to the listing of a property in the National Register or a determination of its eligibility where the private owners object to listing will be considered by the Keeper and the nomination will be substantively reviewed.</P>
          <P>(u) State Historic Preservation Officers are required to inform the property owners and the chief elected local official when properties are listed in the National Register. In the case of a nomination where there are more than 50 property owners, they may be notified of the entry in the National Register by the same general notice stated in § 60.6(d). States which notify all property owners individually of entries in the National Register need not publish a general notice.</P>
          <P>(v) In the case of nominations where the owner of private property (or the majority of such owners for a district or single property with multiple owners) has objected and the Keeper has determined the nomination eligible for the National Register, the State Historic Preservation Officer shall notify the appropriate chief elected local official and the owner(s) of such property of this determination. The general notice may be used for properties with more than 50 owners as described in § 60.6(d) or the State Historic Preservation Officer may notify the owners individually.</P>

          <P>(w) If subsequent to nomination a State makes major revisions to a nomination or renominates a property rejected by the Keeper, the State Historic Preservation Officer shall notify the affected property owner(s) and the chief elected local official of the revisions or renomination in the same manner as the original notification for the nomination, but need not resubmit the nomination to the State Review Board. Comments received and notarized statements of objection must be forwarded to the Keeper along with the revisions or renomination. The State Historic Preservation Officer also certifies by the resubmittal that the affected property owner(s) and the chief elected local official have been renotified. “Major revisions” as used herein <PRTPAGE P="368"/>means revisions of boundaries or important substantive revisions to the nomination which could be expected to change the ultimate outcome as to whether or not the property is listed in the National Register by the Keeper.</P>
          <P>(x) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the State Historic Preservation Officer in the nomination notification process or otherwise need not make available to any person or entity (except a Federal agency planning a project, the property owner, the chief elected local official of the political jurisdiction in which the property is located, and the local historic preservation commission for certified local governments) specific information relating to the location of properties proposed to be nominated to, or listed in, the National Register if he or she determines that the disclosure of specific information would create a risk of destruction or harm to such properties.</P>
          <P>(y) With regard to property under Federal ownership or control, completed nomination forms shall be submitted to the Federal Preservation Officer for review and comment. The Federal Preservation Officer, may approve the nomination and forward it to the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Nominations by Federal agencies.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, requires that, with the advice of the Secretary and in cooperation with the State Historic Preservation Officer of the State involved, each Federal agency shall establish a program to locate, inventory and nominate to the Secretary all properties under the agency's ownership or control that appear to qualify for inclusion on the National Register. Section 2(a) of Executive Order 11593 provides that Federal agencies shall locate, inventory, and nominate to the Secretary of the Interior all sites, buildings, districts, and objects under their jurisdiction or control that appear to qualify for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Additional responsibilities of Federal agencies are detailed in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, Executive Order 11593, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974, and procedures developed pursuant to these authorities, and other related legislation.</P>
          <P>(b) Nomination forms are prepared under the supervision of the Federal Preservation Officer designated by the head of a Federal agency to fulfill agency responsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended.</P>
          <P>(c) Completed nominations are submitted to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer for review and comment regarding the adequacy of the nomination, the significance of the property and its eligibility for the National Register. The chief elected local officials of the county (or equivalent governmental unit) and municipal political jurisdiction in which the property is located are notified and given 45 days in which to comment. The State Historic Preservation Officer signs block 12 of the nomination form with his/her recommendation.</P>
          <P>(d) After receiving the comments of the State Historic Preservation Officer, and chief elected local official, or if there has been no response within 45 days, the Federal Preservation Officer may approve the nomination and forward it to the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240. The Federal Preservation Officer signs block 12 of the nomination form if in his or her opinion the property meets the National Register criteria for evaluation. The Federal Preservation Officer's signature in block 12 certifies that:</P>

          </P>
          <P>(4) In the opinion of the Federal Preservation Officer, the property meets the National Register criteria for evaluation.</P>
          <P>(e) When a Federal Preservation Officer submits a nomination form for a property that he or she does not believe meets the National Register criteria for evaluation, the Federal Preservation Officer signs a continuation sheet Form NPS 10-900a explaining his/her opinions on the eligibility of the property and certifying that:</P>
          <P>(1) All procedural requirements have been met;</P>
          <P>(2) The nomination form is adequately documented;</P>
          <P>(3) The nomination form is technically and professionally correct and sufficient.</P>
          <P>(f) The comments of the State Historic Preservation Officer and chief local official are appended to the nomination, or, if there are no comments from the State Historic Preservation Officer an explanation is attached. Concurrent nominations (see § 60.10) cannot be submitted, however, until the nomination has been considered by the State in accord with Sec. 60.6, supra. Comments received by the State concerning concurrent nominations and notarized statements of objection must be submitted with the nomination.</P>
          <P>(g) Notice will be provided in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that the nominated property is being considered for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in accord with § 60.13.</P>
          <P>(h) Nominations will be included in the National Register within 45 days of receipt by the Keeper or designee unless the Keeper disapproves such nomination or an appeal is filed. Nominations which are technically or professionally inadequate will be returned for correction and resubmission. When a property does not appear to meet the National Register criteria for evaluation, the nomination will be returned with an explanation as to why the property does not meet the National Register criteria for evaluation.</P>
          <P>(i) Any person or organization which supports or opposes the nomination of a property by a Federal Preservation Officer may petition the Keeper during the nomination process either to accept or reject a nomination. The petitioner must state the grounds of the petition and request in writing that the Keeper substantively review the nomination. Such petition received by the Keeper prior to the listing of a property in the National Register or a determination of its eligibility where the private owner(s) object to listing will be considered by the Keeper and the nomination will be substantively reviewed.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Concurrent State and Federal nominations.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) State Historic Preservation Officers and Federal Preservation Officers are encouraged to cooperate in locating, inventorying, evaluating, and nominating all properties possessing historical, architectural, archeological, or cultural value. Federal agencies may nominate properties where a portion of the property is not under Federal ownership or control.</P>
          <P>(b) When a portion of the area included in a Federal nomination is not located on land under the ownership or control of the Federal agency, but is an integral part of the cultural resource, the completed nomination form shall be sent to the State Historic Preservation Officer for notification to property owners, to give owners of private property an opportunity to concur in or object to the nomination, to solicit written comments and for submission to the State Review Board pursuant to the procedures in § 60.6.</P>

          <P>(c) If the State Historic Preservation Officer and the State Review Board agree that the nomination meets the National Register criteria for evaluation, the nomination is signed by the State Historic Preservation Officer and returned to the Federal agency initiating the nomination. If the State Historic Preservation Officer and the State Review Board disagree, the nomination shall be returned to the Federal agency with the opinions of the State Historic Preservation Officer and the State Review Board concerning the adequacy of the nomination and whether or not the property meets the criteria for evaluation. The opinion of the State Review Board may be the minutes of the State Review Board meeting. The State Historic Preservation <PRTPAGE P="370"/>Officer's signed opinion and comments shall confirm to the Federal agency that the State nomination procedures have been fulfilled including notification requirements. Any comments received by the State shall be included with the letter as shall any notarized statements objecting to the listing of private property.</P>
          <P>(d) If the owner of any privately owned property, (or a majority of the owners of such properties within a district or single property with multiple owners) objects to such inclusion by notarized statement(s) the Federal Historic Preservation Officer shall submit the nomination to the Keeper for review and a determination of eligibility. Comments, opinions, and notarized statements of objection shall be submitted with the nomination.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Requests for nominations.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer as appropriate shall respond in writing within 60 days to any person or organization submitting a completed National Register nomination form or requesting consideration for any previously prepared nomination form on record with the State or Federal agency. The response shall provide a technical opinion concerning whether or not the property is adequately documented and appears to meet the National Register criteria for evaluation in § 60.4. If the nomination form is determined to be inadequately documented, the nominating authority shall provide the applicant with an explanation of the reasons for that determination.</P>
          <P>(b) If the nomination form does not appear to be adequately documented, upon receiving notification, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide necessary additional documentation.</P>
          <P>(c) If the nomination form appears to be adequately documented and if the property appears to meet the National Register criteria for evaluation, the State Historic Preservation Officer shall comply with the notification requirements in § 60.6 and schedule the property for presentation at the earliest possible State Review Board meeting. Scheduling shall be consistent with the State's established priorities for processing nominations. If the nomination form is adequately documented, but the property does not appear to meet National Register criteria for evaluation, the State Historic Preservation Officer need not process the nomination, unless so requested by the Keeper pursuant to § 60.12.</P>
          <P>(d) The State Historic Preservation Officer's response shall advise the applicant of the property's position in accord with the State's priorities for processing nominations and of the approximate date the applicant can expect its consideration by the State Review Board. The State Historic Preservation Officer shall also provide notice to the applicant of the time and place of the Review Board meeting at least 30 but not more than 75 days before the meeting, as well as complying with the notification requirements in § 60.6.</P>
          <P>(e) Upon action on a nomination by the State Review Board, the State Historic Preservation Officer shall, within 90 days, submit the nomination to the National Park Service, or, if the State Historic Preservation Officer does not consider the property eligible for the National Register, so advise the applicant within 45 days.</P>
          <P>(f) If the applicant substantially revises a nomination form as a result of comments by the State or Federal agency, it may be treated by the State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer as a new submittal and reprocessed in accord with the requirements in this section.</P>
          <P>(g) The Federal Preservation Officer shall request the comments of the State Historic Preservation Officer and notify the applicant in writing within 90 days of receipt of an adequately documented nomination form as to whether the Federal agency will nominate the property. The Federal Preservation Officer shall submit an adequately documented nomination to the National Park Service unless in his or her opinion the property is not eligible for the National Register.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Nomination appeals.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Any person or local government may appeal to the Keeper the failure or refusal of a nominating authority to nominate a property that the person or local government considers to meet the National Register criteria for evaluation upon decision of a nominating authority to not nominate a property for any reason when requested pursuant to § 60.11, or upon failure of a State Historic Preservation Officer to nominate a property recommended by the State Review Board. (This action differs from the procedure for appeals during the review of a nomination by the National Park Service where an individual or organization may “petition the Keeper during the nomination process,” as specified in §§ 60.6(t) and 60.9(i). Upon receipt of such petition the normal 45-day review period will be extended for 30 days beyond the date of the petition to allow the petitioner to provide additional documentation for review.)</P>
          <P>(b) Such appeal shall include a copy of the nomination form and documentation previously submitted to the State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer, an explanation of why the applicant is submitting the appeal in accord with this section and shall include pertinent correspondence from the State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer.</P>
          <P>(c) The Keeper will respond to the appellant and the State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer with a written explanation either denying or sustaining the appeal within 45 days of receipt. If the appeal is sustained, the Keeper will:</P>
          <P>(1) Request the State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer to submit the nomination to the Keeper within 15 days if the nomination has completed the procedural requirements for nomination as described in §§ 60.6 or 60.9 except that concurrence of the State Review Board, State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer is not required; or</P>
          <P>(2) If the nomination has not completed these procedural requirements, request the State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer to promptly process the nomination pursuant to §§ 60.6 or 60.9 and submit the nomination to the Keeper without delay.</P>
          <P>(d) State Historic Preservation Officers and Federal Preservation Officers shall process and submit such nominations if so requested by the Keeper pursuant to this section. The Secretary reserves the right to list properties in the National Register or determine properties eligible for such listing on his own motion when necessary to assist in the preservation of historic resources and after notifying the owner and appropriate parties and allowing for a 30-day comment period.</P>
          <P>(e) No person shall be considered to have exhausted administrative remedies with respect to failure to nominate a property to the National Register until he or she has complied with procedures set forth in this section. The decision of the Keeper is the final administrative action on such appeals.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Publication in the Federal Register and other NPS notification.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) When a nomination is received, NPS will publish notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that the property is being considered for listing in the National Register. A 15-day commenting period from date of publication will be provided. When necessary to assist in the preservation of historic properties this 15-day period may be shortened or waived.</P>

          <P>(b) NPS shall notify the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer, Federal Preservation Officer, person or local government when there is no approved State program of the listing of the property in the National Register and will publish notice of the listing in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>

          <P>(c) In nominations where the owner of any privately owned property (or a majority of the owners of such properties within a district or single property with multiple owners) has objected and the Keeper has determined the nomination eligible for the National Register, NPS shall notify the State Historic Preservation Officer, the Federal Preservation Officer (for Federal or concurrent nominations), the person or local government where there is no approved State Historic <PRTPAGE P="372"/>Preservation Program and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. NPS will publish notice of the determination of eligibility in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

          <SUBJECT>Changes and revisions to properties listed in the National Register.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Boundary changes.</E> (1) A boundary alteration shall be considered as a new property nomination. All forms, criteria and procedures used in nominating a property to the National Register must be used. In the case of boundary enlargements only those owners in the newly nominated as yet unlisted area need be notified and will be counted in determining whether a majority of private owners object to listing. In the case of a diminution of a boundary, owners shall be notified as specified in § 60.15 concerning removing properties from the National Register. A professionally justified recommendation by the State Historic Preservation Officer, Federal Preservation Officer, or person or local government where there is no approved State Historic Preservation Program shall be presented to NPS. During this process, the property is not taken off the National Register. If the Keeper or his or her designee finds the recommendation in accordance with the National Register criteria for evaluation, the change will be accepted. If the boundary change is not accepted, the old boundaries will remain. Boundary revisions may be appealed as provided for in §§ 60.12 and 60.15.</P>
          <P>(2) Four justifications exist for altering a boundary: Professional error in the initial nomination, loss of historic integrity, recognition of additional significance, additional research documenting that a larger or smaller area should be listed. No enlargement of a boundary should be recommended unless the additional area possesses previously unrecognized significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering or culture. No diminution of a boundary should be recommended unless the properties being removed do not meet the National Register criteria for evaluation. Any proposal to alter a boundary has to be documented in detail including photographing the historic resources falling between the existing boundary and the other proposed boundary.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Relocating properties listed in the National Register.</E> (1) Properties listed in the National Register should be moved only when there is no feasible alternative for preservation. When a property is moved, every effort should be made to reestablish its historic orientation, immediate setting, and general environment.</P>
          <P>(2) If it is proposed that a property listed in the National Register be moved and the State Historic Preservation Officer, Federal agency for a property under Federal ownership or control, or person or local government where there is no approved State Historic Preservation Program, wishes the property to remain in the National Register during and after the move, the State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer having ownership or control or person or local government where there is no approved State Historic Preservation Program, shall submit documentation to NPS prior to the move. The documentation shall discuss:</P>
          <P>(i) The reasons for the move;</P>
          <P>(ii) The effect on the property's historical integrity;</P>
          <P>(iii) The new setting and general environment of the proposed site, including evidence that the proposed site does not possess historical or archeological significance that would be adversely affected by the intrusion of the property; and</P>
          <P>(iv) Photographs showing the proposed location.</P>

          <P>(3) Any such proposal with respect to the new location shall follow the required notification procedures, shall be approved by the State Review Board if it is a State nomination and shall continue to follow normal review procedures. The Keeper shall also follow the required notification procedures for nominations. The Keeper shall respond to a properly documented request within 45 days of receipt from the State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer, or within 90 days of receipt from a person or local government where there is no approved State Historic Preservation Program, concerning whether or not the move is <PRTPAGE P="373"/>approved. Once the property is moved, the State Historic Preservation Officer, Federal Preservation Officer, or person or local government where there is no approved State Historic Preservation Program shall submit to the Keeper for review:</P>
          <P>(i) A letter notifying him or her of the date the property was moved;</P>
          <P>(ii) Photographs of the property on its new site; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Revised maps, including a U.S.G.S. map,</P>
          <P>(iv) Acreage, and</P>
          <P>(v) Verbal boundary description.</P>
          <FP>The Keeper shall respond to a properly documented submittal within 45 days of receipt with the final decision on whether the property will remain in the National Register. If the Keeper approves the move, the property will remain in the National Register during and after the move unless the integrity of the property is in some unforeseen manner destroyed. If the Keeper does not approve the move, the property will be automatically deleted from the National Register when moved. In cases of properties removed from the National Register, if the State, Federal agency, or person or local government where there is no approved State Historic Preservation Program has neglected to obtain prior approval for the move or has evidence that previously unrecognized significance exists, or has accrued, the State, Federal agency, person or local government may resubmit a nomination for the property.</FP>
          <P>(4) In the event that a property is moved, deletion from the National Register will be automatic unless the above procedures are followed prior to the move. If the property has already been moved, it is the responsibility of the State, Federal agency or person or local government which nominated the property to notify the National Park Service. Assuming that the State, Federal agency or person or local government wishes to have the structure reentered in the National Register, it must be nominated again on new forms which should discuss:</P>
          <P>(i) The reasons for the move;</P>
          <P>(ii) The effect on the property's historical integrity, and</P>
          <P>(iii) The new setting and general environment, including evidence that the new site does not possess historical or archeological significance that would be adversely affected by intrusion of the property.</P>
          <FP>In addition, new photographs, acreage, verbal boundary description and a U.S.G.S. map showing the structure at its new location must be sent along with the revised nomination. Any such nomination submitted by a State must be approved by the State Review Board.</FP>
          <P>(5) Properties moved in a manner consistent with the comments of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in accord with its procedures (36 CFR part 800), are granted as exception to § 60.12(b). Moving of properties in accord with the Advisory Council's procedures should be dealt with individually in each memorandum of agreement. In such cases, the State Historic Preservation Officer or the Federal Preservation Officer, for properties under Federal ownership or control, shall notify the Keeper of the new location after the move including new documentation as described above.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Removing properties from the National Register.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Grounds for removing properties from the National Register are as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) The property has ceased to meet the criteria for listing in the National Register because the qualities which caused it to be originally listed have been lost or destroyed, or such qualities were lost subsequent to nomination and prior to listing;</P>
          <P>(2) Additional information shows that the property does not meet the National Register criteria for evaluation;</P>
          <P>(3) Error in professional judgment as to whether the property meets the criteria for evaluation; or</P>

          <P>(4) Prejudicial procedural error in the nomination or listing process. Properties removed from the National Register for procedural error shall be reconsidered for listing by the Keeper after correction of the error or errors by the State Historic Preservation Officer, Federal Preservation Officer, person or local government which originally nominated the property, or by <PRTPAGE P="374"/>the Keeper, as appropriate. The procedures set forth for nominations shall be followed in such reconsiderations. Any property or district removed from the National Register for procedural deficiencies in the nomination and/or listing process shall automatically be considered eligible for inclusion in the National Register without further action and will be published as such in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(b) Properties listed in the National Register prior to December 13, 1980, may only be removed from the National Register on the grounds established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) Any person or organization may petition in writing for removal of a property from the National Register by setting forth the reasons the property should be removed on the grounds established in paragraph (a) of this section. With respect to nominations determined eligible for the National Register because the owners of private property object to listing, anyone may petition for reconsideration of whether or not the property meets the criteria for evaluation using these procedures. Petitions for removal are submitted to the Keeper by the State Historic Preservation Officer for State nominations, the Federal Preservation Officer for Federal nominations, and directly to the Keeper from persons or local governments where there is no approved State Historic Preservation Program.</P>
          <P>(d) Petitions submitted by persons or local governments where there is no approved State Historic Preservation Program shall include a list of the owner(s). In such cases the Keeper shall notify the affected owner(s) and the chief elected local official and give them an opportunity to comment. For approved State programs, the State Historic Preservation Officer shall notify the affected owner(s) and chief elected local official and give them an opportunity to comment prior to submitting a petition for removal. The Federal Preservation Officer shall notify and obtain the comments of the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer prior to forwarding an appeal to NPS. All comments and opinions shall be submitted with the petition.</P>
          <P>(e) The State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer shall respond in writing within 45 days of receipt to petitions for removal of property from the National Register. The response shall advise the petitioner of the State Historic Preservation Officer's or Federal Preservation Officer's views on the petition.</P>
          <P>(f) A petitioner desiring to pursue his removal request must notify the State Historic Preservation Officer or the Federal Preservation Officer in writing within 45 days of receipt of the written views on the petition.</P>
          <P>(g) The State Historic Preservation Officer may elect to have a property considered for removal according to the State's nomination procedures unless the petition is on procedural grounds and shall schedule it for consideration by the State Review Board as quickly as all notification requirements can be completed following procedures outlined in § 60.6, or the State Historic Preservation Officer may elect to forward the petition for removal to the Keeper with his or her comments without State Review Board consideration.</P>
          <P>(h) Within 15 days after receipt of the petitioner's notification of intent to pursue his removal request, the State Historic Preservation Officer shall notify the petitioner in writing either that the State Review Board will consider the petition on a specified date or that the petition will be forwarded to the Keeper after notification requirements have been completed. The State Historic Preservation Officer shall forward the petitions to the Keeper for review within 15 days after notification requirements or Review Board consideration, if applicable, have been completed.</P>
          <P>(i) Within 15 days after receipt of the petitioner notification of intent to pursue his petition, the Federal Preservation Officer shall forward the petition with his or her comments and those of the State Historic Preservation Officer to the Keeper.</P>

          <P>(j) The Keeper shall respond to a petition for removal within 45 days of receipt, except where the Keeper must notify the owners and the chief elected local official. In such cases the Keeper shall respond within 90 days of receipt. <PRTPAGE P="375"/>The Keeper shall notify the petitioner and the applicable State Historic Preservation Officer, Federal Preservation Officer, or person or local government where there is no approved State Historic Preservation Program, of his decision. The State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer transmitting the petition shall notify the petitioner, the owner(s), and the chief elected local official in writing of the decision. The Keeper will provide such notice for petitions from persons or local governments where there is no approved State Historic Preservation Program. The general notice may be used for properties with more than 50 owners. If the general notice is used it shall be published in one or more newspapers with general circulation in the area of the nomination.</P>
          <P>(k) The Keeper may remove a property from the National Register on his own motion on the grounds established in paragraph (a) of this section, except for those properties listed in the National Register prior to December 13, 1980, which may only be removed from the National Register on the grounds established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In such cases, the Keeper will notify the nominating authority, the affected owner(s) and the applicable chief elected local official and provide them an opportunity to comment. Upon removal, the Keeper will notify the nominating authority of the basis for the removal. The State Historic Preservation Officer, Federal Preservation Officer, or person or local government which nominated the property shall notify the owner(s) and the chief elected local official of the removal.</P>
          <P>(l) No person shall be considered to have exhausted administrative remedies with respect to removal of a property from the National Register until the Keeper has denied a petition for removal pursuant to this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Authorization.</SUBJECT>

          <P>The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470 <E T="03">et seq.</E>):</P>
          <P>(a) Requires the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to promulgate regulations for:</P>
          <P>(1) Approving and overseeing State historic preservation programs;</P>
          <P>(2) Certifying local governments to carry out the purposes of the Act;</P>
          <P>(3) Ensuring that applicable State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPOs) allocate to certified local governments (CLGs) a share of grants that the SHPOs receive under the Act; and</P>
          <P>(4) Assisting Indian tribes in preserving their particular “historic properties” (as defined by the Act);</P>
          <P>(b) Directs the Secretary to administer a program of grants-in-aid to States and Indian tribes for historic preservation projects and programs that the Secretary has approved; and</P>
          <P>(c) Requires the Secretary to make available information concerning professional standards, methods, and techniques for the preservation of “historic properties” (as defined by the Act) and the administration of historic preservation programs.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 61.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>As used in this part:</P>
          <P>(a) All terms that the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, defines have the same meaning in the regulations in this part that the statute provides; see especially sections 101(a)(1)(A), 101(b), 101(c)(4), 108, and 301.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Act</E> means the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 470 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Chief elected local official</E> means the elected head of a local government.<PRTPAGE P="376"/>
          </P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">The Secretary's Standards</E> means only the “Standards” portions and not the “Guidelines” portions of “the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation.” The Secretary's Standards provide broad national principles of archeological and historic preservation practices and methods. “The Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation” also contains “the Secretary's Guidelines” which provide broad national guidance on how to apply “the Secretary's Standards.”</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">State historic preservation program</E> or <E T="03">State program</E> means a State government organization or program meeting the requirements that section 101(b) of the Act specifies.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 61.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Implementation of this part.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">National Park Service policy of management by exception.</E> The National Park Service (NPS) will administer the regulations in this part in such a way (and where feasible) as to:</P>
          <P>(1) Limit the use of direct Federal management review procedures to high risk situations, to new programs, or to activities that are appropriate for the Federal Government to oversee;</P>
          <P>(2) Presume that State, tribal, and local government historic preservation officials manage their programs in an accountable way unless situations indicate the contrary; and</P>
          <P>(3) Rely to the maximum extent feasible on State, tribal, and local government systems of financial and program management that meet Federal standards. At the discretion of the Secretary, each State, tribal, and local government may substitute its own fiscal audit and management systems for the Secretary's comparable fiscal audit and management requirements, so long as the State, tribal, or local government system establishes and maintains accounting standards substantially similar to Federal standards and provides for independent peer review.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">The Secretary's Standards.</E> NPS will use the Secretary's Standards as technical performance standards for matters covered by this part. NPS may also use as technical performance standards (for matters covered by this part) additional guidance that NPS identifies and provides from time to time after appropriate consultation and notice.</P>
          <P>(c) Each State historic preservation program staff member, State Historic Preservation Review Board (Review Board) member, and certified local government (CLG) historic preservation review commission (Commission) member whom the Secretary has approved as meeting “the Secretary's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards” will retain that status, regardless of subsequent revisions to those Standards, until such time as that individual no longer works in that program, or serves on that Review Board, or serves on that Commission with which that individual was affiliated as of the date of that individual's approval.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 61.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>State programs.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) For a State to participate in the program that this part describes, the Governor must appoint and designate a State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) to administer the State historic preservation program.</P>
          <P>(b) It is the responsibility of the SHPO to carry out the duties and activities that section 101 (b)(3) of the Act describes. In performing those duties and activities:</P>
          <P>(1) The SHPO must carry out a historic preservation planning process that includes the development and implementation of a comprehensive statewide historic preservation plan that provides guidance for effective decision making about historic property preservation throughout the State.</P>
          <P>(2) The SHPO, in addition to surveying and maintaining inventories of historic properties, may also obtain:</P>

          <P>(i) Comparative data valuable in determining the National Register eligibility of properties;<PRTPAGE P="377"/>
          </P>
          <P>(ii) Information on properties that may become eligible for the National Register of Historic Places with the passage of time; and/or</P>
          <P>(iii) Information on the absence of historic properties for use in planning for public and private development projects.</P>
          <P>(3) The SHPO must provide for adequate public participation in the State historic preservation program as a whole.</P>
          <P>(i) As part of the process of recommending a property to the National Register, the SHPO must comply with the consultation and notification procedures contained in 36 CFR part 60.</P>
          <P>(ii) The SHPO may authorize other persons or entities to fulfill the notice requirements in 36 CFR part 60 pursuant to the Secretary's written guidance.</P>
          <P>(iii) The SHPO also may authorize the historic preservation review commission (Commission) of a certified local government (CLG) to act in place of the State Historic Preservation Review Board (Review Board) for the purpose of considering National Register nominations within its jurisdiction, provided that the Commission both meets the professional qualifications required for the Review Board when considering such nominations and otherwise follows the Secretary's written guidance.</P>
          <P>(iv) In accordance with the Secretary's written guidance and with the consent of both the property owners in a nomination and the chief elected local official, the Review Board (or the Commission acting in its place) may consider the nomination without a face-to-face meeting.</P>
          <P>(4) The SHPO may carry out all or any part of his or her responsibilities by contract or cooperative agreement with any qualified nonprofit organization, educational institution, or otherwise pursuant to State law. However, the SHPO may not delegate the responsibility for compliance with the Act or with grant assistance terms and conditions.</P>
          <P>(c) The Secretary will consider individual SHPO proposals for programs that, for a specified period, include fewer duties than those section 101(b)(3) of the Act specifies, if a different approach would better serve an appropriate balance of historic property, customer or constituent, and historic preservation needs.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures for review and approval of State historic preservation programs.</E> (1) In accordance with the Act, the Secretary will evaluate each State program for consistency with the Act periodically, but not less often than every four years. If the Secretary determines that it meets the program requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), (e) and (f) of this section, he or she will approve the State program as set forth in this section.</P>
          <P>(2) The Secretary may use on-site and/or off-site inquiries to perform such evaluation. The Secretary will provide the SHPO with a timely report containing written findings and analyses that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the State program.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Approval method.</E> (i) If the Secretary determines that a State program is consistent with the Act, the report will include notice that the State program's approved status continues.</P>
          <P>(ii) If the Secretary determines that a State program has major aspects not consistent with the Act, the report will include notice of deficiencies along with required actions for correcting them. Unless circumstances warrant immediate action, the Secretary will provide a specified period to allow the SHPO either to correct the deficiencies or to present for Secretarial approval a justifiable plan and timetable for correcting the deficiencies. During this period, the SHPO has the opportunity to request that the Secretary reconsider any findings and required actions.</P>
          <P>(iii) The Secretary will provide timely notice of continued approved State program status to a SHPO successfully resolving deficiencies. Once the Secretary renews a State program's approved status, he or she generally will not review the program until the next regular evaluation period. However, if the Secretary deems it necessary, he or she may conduct a review more often.</P>

          <P>(iv) The Secretary will provide timely notice of the revocation of a program's approved status to any SHPO whose program has deficiencies that warrant immediate action or that remain uncorrected after the expiration <PRTPAGE P="378"/>of the period specified pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. The Secretary will then initiate financial suspension and other actions in accordance with the Act, applicable regulatory requirements, and related guidance that the National Park Service issues.</P>
          <P>(e) The SHPO must appoint or employ a professionally qualified staff.</P>
          <P>(1) Except as approved pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the staff must include at a minimum, one individual meeting “the Secretary's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards” for history, one individual meeting “the Secretary's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards” for historic or prehistoric archeology, and one individual meeting “the Secretary's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards” for architectural history. “The Secretary's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards” and related guidance are part of the larger “Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation.” The SHPO may determine that additional professional staff members representing the required or other disciplines are necessary to administer the State program in accordance with the Act.</P>
          <P>(2) The Secretary will consider proposals from a SHPO for a minimum required staff composition that differs from the requirement that paragraph (e)(1) of this section specifies, if the proposal addresses better an appropriate balance of historic property, customer or constituent, and historic preservation needs in that State.</P>
          <P>(3) When a staff position that paragraph (e)(1) of this section requires becomes vacant, the SHPO must fill the vacancy in a timely manner. In the interim, the SHPO must ensure that appropriately qualified individuals address technical matters. A vacancy in a required position that persists for more than six months is cause for review, comment, and appropriate action by the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(f) Unless State law provides for a different method of appointment, the SHPO must appoint an adequate and qualified State historic preservation Review Board (Review Board).</P>
          <P>(1) All Review Board members must have demonstrated competence, interest, or knowledge in historic preservation. A majority of Review Board members must meet “the Secretary of the Interior's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards” which are part of the larger “Secretary's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation.” The members meeting “the Secretary's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards” must include at a minimum, one individual meeting “the Secretary's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards” for history, one individual meeting “the Secretary's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards” for prehistoric archeology or historic archeology, and one individual meeting “the Secretary's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards” for architectural history. One person may meet the Standards for more than one required discipline. The other Review Board members, if any, who comprise the majority that meets “the Secretary's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards” may represent, subject to the SHPO's selection, any of the disciplines that those “Standards” describe.</P>
          <P>(2) The Secretary will consider proposals from a SHPO for a minimum required Review Board composition that differs from the requirement that paragraph (f)(1) of this section specifies, if the proposal addresses better an appropriate balance of historic property, customer or constituent, and historic preservation needs in that State.</P>
          <P>(3) When a required Review Board position becomes vacant, the SHPO must fill the vacancy in a timely manner. In the interim, the SHPO must ensure that the Review Board has access to advice from appropriately qualified individuals. A lapse of more than one year in filling the vacancy is cause for review, comment, and appropriate action by the Secretary.</P>

          <P>(4) The Review Board must meet as often as is necessary to complete its work in a timely fashion but no less often than once a year.<PRTPAGE P="379"/>
          </P>
          <P>(5) The Review Board must adopt written procedures governing its operations consistent with the provisions of this section and related guidance that the National Park Service issues.</P>
          <P>(6) Review Board responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
          <P>(i) Providing advice to the SHPO on the full range of Historic Preservation Fund-supported activities, that section 101 (b)(3) of the Act describes;</P>
          <P>(ii) Reviewing and making recommendations on National Register nomination proposals;</P>
          <P>(iii) Participating in the review of appeals to National Register nominations; and</P>
          <P>(iv) Performing such other duties as may be appropriate.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 61.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Grants to State programs.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Each State with an approved State program is eligible for grants-in-aid from the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF).</P>
          <P>(b) The National Park Service (NPS) will administer HPF matching grants-in-aid in accordance with the Act, OMB Circular A-133 and 43 CFR part 12, and related guidance that NPS issues. Failure by a State program to meet these requirements is cause for comment and appropriate action by the Secretary.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 61.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Certified local government programs.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Each approved State program must provide a mechanism for certification (by the State Historic Preservation Officer and the Secretary) of local governments to carry out the purposes of the Act.</P>
          <P>(b) Each State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) must follow procedures that the Secretary approves for the certification of local governments. Each SHPO also must follow procedures for removal of certified local government (CLG) status for cause. A SHPO must submit any proposed amendment to its procedures to the Secretary for approval. The Secretary will act on each proposal in a timely fashion generally within 45 days of receipt.</P>
          <P>(c) When a SHPO approves a local government certification request in accordance with the State program's National Park Service (NPS)-approved certification process, the SHPO must prepare a written certification agreement between the SHPO and the local government. The certification agreement must list the specific responsibilities of the local government when certified. The SHPO must submit to the Secretary the written certification agreement and any additional information as is necessary for the Secretary to certify the local government pursuant to the Act and this part. If the Secretary does not disapprove the proposed certification within 15 working days of receipt, the Secretary has certified the local government.</P>
          <P>(d) Beyond the minimum responsibilities set out in the Act for all CLGs, the SHPO may make additional delegations of responsibility to individual CLGs. However, these delegations may not include the SHPO's overall responsibility derived from the Act or where law or regulation specifies.</P>
          <P>(e) The SHPO must ensure that each local government satisfies the following minimum requirements as conditions for certification. Each CLG must:</P>
          <P>(1) Enforce appropriate State or local legislation for the designation and protection of historic properties. The State procedures must define what constitutes appropriate legislation, as long as:</P>
          <P>(i) Designation provisions in such legislation include the identification and registration of properties for protection that meet criteria established by the State or the locality for significant historic and prehistoric resources within the jurisdiction of the local government;</P>
          <P>(ii) Protection provisions in such legislation include a local review process under State or local law for proposed demolitions of, changes to, or other action that may affect historic properties as paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section describes; and</P>
          <P>(iii) The legislation otherwise is consistent with the Act.</P>

          <P>(2) Establish by State or local law and maintain an adequate and qualified historic preservation review commission (Commission). All Commission members must have a demonstrated interest, competence, or knowledge in <PRTPAGE P="380"/>historic preservation. Unless State or local legislation provides for a different method of appointment, the chief elected local official must appoint all Commission members.</P>
          <P>(i) The State procedures must encourage certified local governments to include individuals who meet “the Secretary's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards” among the membership of the Commission, to the extent that such individuals are available in the community.</P>
          <P>(ii) The State procedures may specify the minimum number of Commission members who must meet “the Secretary's (Historic Preservation) Professional Qualifications Standards.” The State procedures may also specify which, if any, disciplines the Commission's membership must include from among those disciplines that the Standards describe. Membership requirements set by the State procedures for Commissions must be cognizant of the needs and functions of Commissions in the State and subject to the availability of such professionals in the community concerned.</P>
          <P>(iii) Provided that the Commission is otherwise adequate and qualified to carry out the responsibilities delegated to it, the SHPO may certify a local government without the minimum number or types of disciplines established in State procedures, if the local government can demonstrate that it has made a reasonable effort to fill those positions, or that an alternative composition of the Commission best meets the needs of the Commission and of the local government.</P>
          <P>(iv) The SHPO must make available to each Commission orientation materials and training designed to provide a working knowledge of the roles and operations of Federal, State, and local historic preservation programs, and historic preservation in general.</P>
          <P>(3) Maintain a system for the survey and inventory of historic properties. The SHPO must ensure that such systems and the data that they produce are capable of integration into and are compatible with statewide inventories and (when and as appropriate) with State and local planning processes.</P>
          <P>(4) Provide for adequate public participation in the local historic preservation program as a whole. The SHPO must provide each CLG with appropriate guidance on mechanisms to ensure adequate public participation in the local historic preservation program including the process for evaluating properties for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.</P>
          <P>(5) Satisfactorily perform the responsibilities delegated to it under the Act. The SHPO must monitor and evaluate the performance of each CLG according to written standards and procedures that the SHPO establishes. If a SHPO's evaluation of a CLG's performance indicates that such performance is inadequate, the SHPO must suggest in writing ways to improve performance. If, after a period of time that the SHPO stipulates, the SHPO determines that the CLG has not improved its performance sufficiently, the SHPO may recommend that the Secretary decertify the local government. If the Secretary does not object within 30 working days of receipt, the Secretary has approved the decertification.</P>
          <P>(f) Effects of certification include:</P>
          <P>(1) Inclusion in the process of nominating properties to the National Register of Historic Places in accordance with sections 101 (c)(2)(A) and (c)(2)(B) of the Act. The SHPO may delegate to a CLG any of the responsibilities of the SHPO and the Review Board in processing National Register nominations as specified in 36 CFR part 60 (see also § 61.4(b)(3)), except for the authority to nominate properties directly to the National Register. A CLG may make nominations directly to NPS only when the State does not have an approved program pursuant to § 61.4.</P>
          <P>(2) Eligibility to apply for a portion of the State's annual Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) grant award. Each State must transfer at least 10 percent of its annual HPF grant award to CLGs for historic preservation projects and programs in accordance with the Act and as § 61.7 specifies.</P>

          <P>(g) The District of Columbia is exempt from the requirements of this section because there are no subordinated local governments in the District. If any other jurisdiction that section 301(2) of the Act defines as a State believes that its political subdivisions lack authorities similar to those of <PRTPAGE P="381"/>local governments in other States, and hence cannot satisfy the requirements for local government certification, it may apply to the Secretary for exemption from the requirements of this section.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Procedures for direct certification by the Secretary where there is no approved State program pursuant to § 61.4.</E> To the extent feasible, the Secretary will ensure that there is consistency and continuity in the CLG program of a State that does not have an approved State program.</P>
          <P>(1) Where there is no approved State program, a local government wishing to become certified must apply directly to the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(2) The application must demonstrate that the local government meets the specifications for certification set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) The Secretary will review certification applications under this paragraph (h) and take action in a timely fashion generally within 90 days of receipt.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 61.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Subgrants to certified local governments.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Each SHPO must transfer at least 10 percent of its annual Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) grant award to CLGs as subgrants for historic preservation projects and programs in accordance with the Act. In any year that the annual HPF State grant appropriation exceeds $65,000,000, SHPOs must transfer one half of the amount over $65,000,000 to CLGs according to procedures that the Secretary will establish.</P>
          <P>(b) Each CLG is eligible to receive funds from the 10 percent (or greater) CLG share of the State's total annual HPF grant award. However, the SHPO need not award funds to all CLGs.</P>
          <P>(c) Each SHPO must maintain and follow a procedure that the Secretary approves for the use and distribution of funds from the State's annual HPF grant award to CLGs to ensure that no CLG receives a disproportionate share of the allocation. The procedure will provide a clear basis for the funding decisions. The SHPO must submit any proposed amendment to its procedure to the Secretary for approval. The Secretary will respond to such a proposal in a timely fashion generally within 45 days of receipt.</P>
          <P>(d) Each SHPO must notify annually each CLG of its opportunity to apply for HPF funding as well as what is entailed in the application and project selection process.</P>
          <P>(e) Each CLG receiving an HPF grant award from the CLG share is a subgrantee of the State. The SHPO must ensure that each CLG adheres to all applicable grant conditions and government-wide and program specific requirements that the National Park Service issues. The SHPO may require specific uses of funds subgranted to CLGs. CLGs may not apply subgranted HPF monies as matching share for any other Federal grant.</P>
          <P>(f) Where there is no approved State program pursuant to § 61.4, the Secretary will determine the method for allocating funds to CLGs in that State in accordance with the procedures set forth for the State in this section. To the extent feasible, the Secretary will ensure consistency and continuity in the funding allocation policy of the CLG program for a State that does not have an approved historic preservation program.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Information collection.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3507 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> has approved the collection of information contained in this part. OMB has assigned clearance number 1024-0038 to this collection of information. The National Park Service (NPS) collects this information as part of the process for reviewing the procedures <PRTPAGE P="382"/>and programs of State and local governments participating in the national historic preservation program and the Historic Preservation Fund grant program. NPS will use the information to evaluate those programs and procedures for consistency with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and compliance with government-wide grant requirements. The obligation to respond is required to obtain a benefit under these programs. Note that a Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. NPS provides no assurance of confidentiality to respondents with the exception of locational information concerning some properties that government historic preservation property inventories include. Pursuant to section 304 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, NPS tightly controls release of information when such release could have the potential of damaging those qualities which make a property historic.</P>
          <P>(b) We estimate the public reporting burden for the collection of this information to average 14.06 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Ms. Diane M. Cooke, Information Collection Officer, National Park Service, 1849 C Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20240 and to the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of the Interior (1024-0038), Washington, D.C. 20503.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose</SUBJECT>
          <P>The procedures in this part set forth the processes and criteria for the identification, evaluation, designation and monitoring of national natural landmarks.</P>
          <P>(a) The National Natural Landmarks Program focuses attention on areas of exceptional natural value to the nation as a whole rather than to one particular State or locality. The program recognizes areas preserved by Federal, State and local agencies as well as private organizations and individuals and encourages the owners of national natural landmarks to voluntarily observe preservation precepts.</P>
          <P>(b) The National Natural Landmarks Program identifies and preserves natural areas that best illustrate the biological and geological character of the United States, enhances the scientific and educational values of preserved areas, strengthens public appreciation of natural history, and fosters a greater concern for the conservation of the nation's natural heritage.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The following definitions apply to this part:</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">National Natural Landmark</E> is an area designated by the Secretary of the Interior as being of national significance to the United States because it is an outstanding example(s) of major biological and geological features found within the boundaries of the United States or its Territories or on the Outer Continental Shelf.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">National Registry of Natural Landmarks</E> is the official listing of all designated national natural landmarks.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">National significance</E> describes an area that is one of the best examples of a biological community or geological feature within a natural region of the <PRTPAGE P="383"/>United States, including terrestrial communities, landforms, geological features and processes, habitats of native plant and animal species, or fossil evidence of the development of life.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Natural region</E> is a distinct physiographic province having similar geologic history, structures, and landforms. The basic physiographic characteristics of a natural region influence its vegetation, climate, soils, and animal life. Examples include the Atlantic Coastal Plain, Great Basin, and Brooks Range natural regions.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Owner</E> means the individual(s), corporation(s), or partnership(s) holding fee simple title to property, or the head of the public agency or subordinate employee of the public agency to whom such authority was delegated and who is responsible for administering publicly owned land. Owner does not include individuals, partnerships, corporations, or public agencies holding easements or less than fee interests (including leaseholds) of any form. A Native American tribe that is the beneficial fee simple owner of lands, with the United States as trustee, will be considered as owner of private property for the purposes of this part. Similarly, individual member(s) of a Native American tribe who are beneficial owner(s) of property, allottee(s) held in trust by the United States, will be considered as owner(s) of private property for the purposes of this part.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Potential national natural landmark</E> means an area that, based on recommendation or initial comparison with other areas in the same natural region, seems to merit further study of its merits for possible national natural landmark designation.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Prejudicial procedural error</E> is one that reasonably may be considered to have affected the outcome of the designation process.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Representative</E> refers to any public or private individual, agency, or organization that is performing actions related to the identification, evaluation, designation or monitoring of national natural landmarks on behalf of or in cooperation with the National Park Service (NPS), either under a contractual agreement or as a volunteer.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Scientist</E> refers to an individual whose combination of academic training and professional field experience in the natural region qualifies him/her to identify and comparatively evaluate natural areas at the regional or national level.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 62.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Effects of designation.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Designation of an area by the Secretary as a national natural landmark is not a land withdrawal, does not change the ownership of an area, and does not dictate activity. However, Federal agencies consider the unique properties of designated national natural landmarks and of areas that meet the criteria for national significance in their planning and impact analysis (see § 62.6(f)), and there may be State or local planning or land use implications. Designation as a national natural landmark does not require or mandate under Federal law any further State or local planning, zoning or other land-use action or decision. Owners who agree to have their lands designated as a national natural landmark do not give up under Federal law any legal rights and privileges of ownership or use of the area. The Department does not gain any property interests in these lands.</P>
          <P>(b) Benefits of national natural landmark designation include the positive recognition and appreciation of nationally significant resources and the ability of public agencies and private individuals and organizations to make more informed development and planning decisions early in regional planning processes. In addition, some private owners of commercially operated national natural landmarks that are open to public visitation may choose to recognize and emphasize the national significance of the areas by providing descriptive information to the public. Under section 170(h) of the United States Internal Revenue Code, some owners of national natural landmarks may be eligible to claim a charitable contribution deduction on their Federal income tax for qualified interests in their natural landmark property donated for a qualified conservation purpose to a qualified conservation organization.</P>

          <P>(c) The Secretary will provide an annual report to the Congress on damaged or threatened designated national <PRTPAGE P="384"/>natural landmarks (see § 62.6(b)). The Secretary will also report to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation any designated national natural landmarks that may be irreparably lost or destroyed by surface mining activity (see § 62.6(e)).</P>

          <SUBJECT>Natural landmark designation and recognition process.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Identification.</E> Potential national natural landmarks are identified in the following manner.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Natural region studies.</E> The NPS conducts inventories of the characteristic biological and geological features in each natural region to provide a scientific basis for identifying potential national natural landmarks. The NPS is responsible for the completion of these studies, which are generally done by qualified scientists under contract. A study provides a classification and description of biological and geological features in that natural region and an annotated list of areas that illustrate those features. During a study, the NPS or any representative of the NPS may enter onto land only after receiving written permission from the owner(s) of that land, except when the land is publicly owned land and otherwise open to the public.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Other entities.</E> (i) Any public or private entity may suggest an area for study and possible national natural landmark designation. The entities include:</P>
          <P>(A) Federal agency programs that conduct inventories in order to identify areas of special interest, for example, essential wildlife habitat, research natural areas, and areas of critical environmental concern; and</P>
          <P>(B) State natural area programs that systematically and comprehensively classify, identify, locate and assess the protective status of the biological and geological features located in a State.</P>
          <P>(ii) If an individual, agency or organization that suggests an area for national natural landmark consideration is not the owner of the area, written permission of the owner(s) is required to enter onto the PNNL to gather information, except when the land is publicly owned and otherwise open to the public.</P>
          <P>(3) After receiving the suggestions from a natural region study and suggestions from other sources, the NPS determines which PNNL merit further study for possible national natural landmark designation. This determination is based on comparison with existing national natural landmarks in the natural region, the national natural landmark criteria (see § 62.5) and other information.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">First Notification.</E> (1) Before a potential national natural landmark is evaluated by scientists as described in paragraph (c) of this section, the NPS notifies the owner(s) in writing, except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(i) This notice advises the owner(s) that the PNNL is being considered for study for possible national natural landmark designation and provides information on the National Natural Landmarks Program, including an explanation of the effects of national natural landmark designation as described in § 62.3.</P>
          <P>(ii) The notice also provides the owner with available information on the area and its tentatively identified significance, solicits the owner's comments on the area, including any information on current or anticipated land use or activities that may affect the area's natural values, integrity, or other matters of concern, and informs the owner of the source of the suggestion for consideration.</P>
          <P>(iii) The notice also requests owner permission to enter the property, unless the area is otherwise open to the public, so the NPS or its representative can conduct an on-site evaluation of the PNNL as described under paragraph (c) of this section, and advises the owner of the procedures the NPS will follow in considering the PNNL for possible designation.</P>

          <P>(2) Before a potential national natural landmark having 50 or more owners is evaluated by scientists as described in paragraph (c) of this section, the NPS provides general notice to property owners. This general notice is published in one or more local newspapers of general circulation in the area in which the potential national natural landmark is located. The notice provides the same information <PRTPAGE P="385"/>listed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) During an on-site evaluation as described in paragraph (c) of this section, the NPS or any representative of the NPS will not enter onto land without permission from the owner(s), except when the land is publicly owned and otherwise open to the public. The NPS may complete evaluations of PNNL by using other information, including information that was previously gathered by other Federal or State agencies or gained from other scientific studies. The NPS notifies owners if areas are evaluated from existing information not requiring land entry.</P>
          <P>(4) The described procedures for providing written notification to owners and receiving responses from owners about the first notification are the responsibility of the NPS and cannot be delegated to any representative of the NPS.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Evaluation.</E> (1) The NPS uses the national natural landmark criteria in § 62.5 to evaluate the potential natural landmark. Potential national natural landmarks are evaluated on a natural region basis; i.e., similar areas that represent a particular type of feature located in the same natural region are compared to identify examples that are most illustrative and have the most intact, undisturbed integrity.</P>
          <P>(2) Evaluations are done by qualified scientists who are familiar with the natural region and its types of biological and geological features. Evaluators make a detailed description of the area, including a proposed boundary map, and assess its regional standing using the national natural landmark criteria (see § 62.5) and any additional information provided by the NPS. Evaluation reports must have been completed or updated within the previous 2 years in order to be considered by the NPS.</P>
          <P>(3) Completed evaluation reports are reviewed by no fewer than three peer reviewers, who are scientists familiar with the biological or geological features of the area or natural region. These reviewers provide the NPS with information on the scientific merit and strength of supportive documentation in the evaluation report. On the basis of evaluation report(s) and the findings of the peer reviewers, the NPS makes a determination that:</P>
          <P>(i) The PNNL does or does not appear to qualify for national natural landmark designation; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Additional information is required before a decision can be made about the status of the PNNL.</P>
          <P>(4) When a PNNL does not seem to qualify for national natural landmark designation, the NPS notifies the owner(s) as prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Second Notification.</E> (1) When the Director determines that an area meets the criteria for national significance, the NPS notifies the owner(s) in writing, except as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(i) The notice references the rules in this part, advises the owners of the procedures the NPS follows and of the effects of national natural landmark designation as described in § 62.3, provides the owner(s) with a copy of the evaluation report, and provides the owner(s) with the opportunity to comment. The list of owners must be obtained from official land or tax records, whichever is most appropriate, within 90 days before issuing the second notification.</P>
          <P>(ii) If in any State the land or tax records are not helpful, the NPS can seek alternative sources to identify the owners.</P>
          <P>(iii) The NPS is responsible for notifying only owners whose names appear on the list.</P>
          <P>(2) If an area has more than 50 owners, the NPS provides a general notice to the property owners. NPS will publish a general notice in one or more local newspapers of general circulation in the region in which the area is located. A copy of the evaluation report is made available on request. In addition, the NPS may conduct a public information meeting, if widespread local public interest warrants it or if requested by the executive of the local governmental jurisdiction in which the area is located.</P>

          <P>(3) In addition, NPS notifies appropriate authorities, organizations and individuals. The notices reference these rules and advise the recipient of the proposed action, of the procedures <PRTPAGE P="386"/>the NPS follows, and of the effects of national natural landmark designation as described in § 62.3. Notice of the proposed action is published also in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> NPS will notify:</P>
          <P>(i) The executive of the local governmental jurisdiction in which the area (PNNL) is located;</P>
          <P>(ii) The governor of the State;</P>
          <P>(iii) Other appropriate State officials;</P>
          <P>(iv) Senators and members of Congress who represent the district in which the area is located;</P>
          <P>(v) Native American tribal governments and native villages and corporations in the region; and</P>
          <P>(vi) Other interested authorities, organizations and individuals as deemed appropriate.</P>
          <P>(4) All notified entities, including non-owners, have 60 days to provide comments before NPS decides whether the area meets the criteria for national significance. To assist in the evaluation of an area, comments should, among other factors, discuss the area's features and integrity. Information is also welcome on current or anticipated land use or threats that could effect the area. Any party may request a reasonable extension of the comment period when additional time is required to study and comment on a landmark proposal. The Director may grant these requests if he or she determines they are in the public interest. All comments received are considered in the national natural landmark designation process.</P>
          <P>(5) Upon individual or general notification, any owner of private property within a PNNL who wishes to object to national natural landmark designation must submit a notarized statement to the Director to certify that he or she is the sole or partial owner of record and he or she objects to the designation. These statements will be submitted during the 60-day comment period. Upon receipt of objections to the designation of a PNNL consisting of multiple parcels of land, the NPS must determine how much of it consists of owners who object to designation. If an owner whose name is not on the ownership list developed by the NPS certifies in a notarized statement that he or she is the sole or partial owner of the area, NPS will take into account his or her views about designation. In circumstances where a single parcel of land within a PNNL has more than one fee simple owner, an objection to designation of that property must be submitted by a majority of the owners.</P>
          <P>(6) All described procedures for the notification of owners and receiving responses from owners in the second notification process are the responsibility of the NPS and cannot be delegated to any representative of the NPS.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Significance determination.</E> (1) NPS will review all documentation including, but not limited to, evaluation reports, peer reviews, and received comments. If NPS determines that a PNNL does not meet the criteria for national significance (see § 62.5), the NPS will notify the owner(s) in writing that their land is no longer under consideration for national natural landmark designation. If PNNL are owned by 50 or more parties, the NPS will publish a general notice as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In addition, the NPS will notify in writing officials, individuals and organizations notified under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) When the NPS determines that a PNNL meets the criteria for national significance, the NPS determines whether any private property owners submitted valid written objection to designation.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Areas meeting criteria.</E> When the Director of NPS determines by all available information that a PNNL meets the criteria for national significance, but some private property owners submitted written objections to the proposed national natural landmark designation, the NPS maintains all this information about the area and which shall be available as part of the environmental analysis for any major federal action for purposes of NEPA which impacts the NNL or these other lands. Notice of this action is provided by the NPS to the owners as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section and to officials, individuals and organizations notified under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. If some but not all of the property owners within a PNNL object to designation, the NPS will exclude the objecting properties and proceed with the process only if enough area remains of non-objecting properties to <PRTPAGE P="387"/>allow sufficient representation of the significant natural features.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">National Park System Advisory Board.</E> (1) The Director of the NPS reviews the documentation of each area that meets the criteria for national significance. When the Director determines that the requirements of this part were met and that enough non-objecting valid private property owners exist to encompass an adequate portion of the nationally significant features, the Director submits the information on the area (PNNL) to the National Park System Advisory Board. The board reviews the information and recommends whether or not the land with consenting owners qualifies for national natural landmark designation.</P>

          <P>(2) Notice of Advisory Board meetings to review national natural landmark nominations and meeting agendas are provided at least 60 days in advance of the meeting by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The NPS also mails copies of the notice directly to consenting owners of areas that are to be considered at each meeting. Interested parties are encouraged to submit written comments and recommendations that will be presented to the board. Interested parties may also attend the board meeting and upon request may address the board concerning an area's national significance.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Submission to the Secretary.</E> The Director submits the recommendation of the Advisory Board and materials that the Director developed to the Secretary for consideration of the nominated area for national natural landmark designation.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Designation.</E> The Secretary reviews the materials that the Director submitted and any other documentation and makes a decision on national natural landmark designation. Areas that the Secretary designates as national natural landmarks are added to the National Registry of Natural Landmarks.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Third notification.</E> When the Secretary designates an area as a national natural landmark, the Secretary notifies in writing the landmark owner(s) of areas with fewer than 50 owners. A general notice of designated areas with 50 or more owners is published in one or more local newspapers of general circulation in the area. The Secretary also notifies the executive of the local governmental jurisdiction in which the landmark is located, Native American tribal governments and native villages and corporations in the area, the governor of the State, the congressional members who represent the district and State in which the landmark is located, and other interested authorities, organizations and individuals as deemed appropriate. The NPS prepares the notifications and is responsible for their distribution. Notices of new designations are also published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(k) <E T="03">Presentation of plaque and certificate.</E> (1) After the Secretary designates an area as a national natural landmark, the NPS may provide each owner who so requests with a certificate signed by the Secretary of the Interior and the Director of the NPS at no cost to the owner(s). This certificate recognizes the owner's interest in protecting and managing the area in a manner that prevents the loss or deterioration of the natural values on which landmark designation is based.</P>
          <P>(2) If appropriate, NPS may also provide without charge a bronze plaque for display in or near the national natural landmark. Upon request, and to the extent NPS resources permit, the NPS may help arrange and participate in a presentation ceremony. In accepting a plaque or certificate, owners give up none of the rights and privileges of ownership or use of the landmark and the Department of the Interior does not acquire any interest in the designated property. After a presentation, the plaque remains the property of NPS. If the landmark designation is removed in accordance with the procedures in § 62.8, NPS may reclaim the plaque.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Natural landmark criteria.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> (1) <E T="03">National significance</E> describes an area that is one of the best examples of a biological or geological feature known to be characteristic of a given natural region. Such features include terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; geologic structures, exposures and landforms that record active geologic processes or portions of earth history; and fossil evidence of biological evolution. Because <PRTPAGE P="388"/>the general character of natural diversity is regionally distinct and correlated with broad patterns of physiography, many types of natural features are entirely inside one of the 33 physiographic provinces of the nation, as defined by Fenneman (Physiographic Divisions of the United States, 1928) and modified as needed by the NPS.</P>
          <P>(2) Because no uniform, nationally applicable classification scheme for biological communities or geological features is accepted and used by the majority of organizations involved in natural-area inventories, a classification system for each inventory of a natural region was developed to identify the types of regionally characteristic natural features sought for representation on the National Registry of Natural Landmarks. Most types represent the scale of distinct biological communities or individual geological, paleontological, or physiographic features, most of which can be mapped at the Earth's surface at 1:24,000 scale or are traceable in the subsurface. In some cases, the NPS may further evaluate only a significant segment of a given natural feature, where the segment is biologically or geologically representative and where the entire feature is so large as to be impracticable for natural landmark consideration (e.g., a mountain range). Almost two-thirds of all national natural landmarks range from about 10 to 5,000 acres, but some are larger or smaller because of the wide variety of natural features recognized by the National Natural Landmarks Program.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> NPS uses the following criteria to evaluate the relative quality of areas as examples of regionally characteristic natural features:</P>

          <SUBJECT>Natural landmark monitoring.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Owner contact.</E> The Field Offices of the NPS maintain periodic contacts with the owners of designated national natural landmarks to determine whether the landmarks retain the values that qualified them for landmark designation and to update administrative records on the areas.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Section</E> 8 <E T="03">Report.</E> (1) The Secretary, through the NPS, prepares an annual <PRTPAGE P="389"/>report to the Congress on all designated national natural landmarks with known or anticipated damage or threats to one or more of the resources that made them nationally significant. This report is mandated by Section 8 of the National Park System General Authorities Act of 1970, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 1a-5).</P>
          <P>(2) A landmark is included in this report if it has lost or is in imminent danger of losing all or part of its natural character to such a degree that one or more of the values that made it nationally significant are or will be irreversibly damaged or destroyed. In assessing the status of a landmark, NPS considers the condition of the landmark at the time of designation, including any changes that have occurred and any threats that could impact it in the future.</P>
          <P>(3) Section 8 also requires the Secretary to make recommendations to the Congress on qualified areas for consideration as additions to the National Park System. No legal mandate requires that the Congress take further action about national natural landmarks listed as damaged or threatened or about areas that are recommended for possible future additions to the National Park System.</P>
          <P>(4) NPS Regional Offices are responsible for monitoring the condition of, and for completing status reports on, all designated national natural landmarks in their regions. In some cases, the NPS may arrange with outside individuals, agencies or organizations to monitor the status of selected national natural landmarks. NPS or its representative usually monitors national natural landmark condition and status during a visit.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Monitoring.</E> (1) The NPS or its representative notifies the owner(s) of a national natural landmark of his or her pending visit to the area to determine its status and condition, and informs the owner(s) of the purposes of monitoring and its relation to the Secretary's annual report on threatened or damaged landmarks.</P>
          <P>(2) While monitoring conditions of designated national natural landmarks, neither NPS nor its representative will enter onto private property or onto public lands that are not otherwise open to the public without first obtaining permission from the owner(s) or administrator(s). The NPS may monitor landmark condition without entering onto lands where required permission has not been granted by using other existing information, including telephone conversations with the owner(s) or manager(s) of the area, written materials provided by the owner or manager, or information previously developed by other Federal or State agencies or other scientific studies. The NPS provides owners with copies of monitoring reports on their property, which will include the name and affiliation of the individual(s) who completed the report.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Section 8 report preparation.</E> (1) After completion of landmark monitoring, the NPS Regional Offices forward their findings and recommendations to the NPS Washington Office. The NPS Washington Office reviews the Regional Office findings and recommendations and prepares a draft report listing only the national natural landmarks with significant known or anticipated damage or threats to the integrity of one or more of the resources that made the area nationally significant.</P>
          <P>(2) Pertinent portions of this draft report, including any executive summary, are provided to the owner(s) or administrator(s) of national natural landmarks listed as is feasible, as well as to other interested authorities, organizations and individuals. All individuals have 30 days to provide written comments to the NPS on the draft report. Comments may include additional information on the condition of landmarks or on the nature or imminence of reported damage or threats to these landmarks. Owners are also asked to indicate whether they would like to receive a copy of the final report, as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>

          <P>(3) The NPS reviews all comments on the draft report and prepares a final report, which the Director transmits to the Secretary for submission to the Congress. Upon release of the final report, the NPS will provide a copy of the report to the owner(s) of landmarks who are listed in the report and have <PRTPAGE P="390"/>requested copies and to other interested authorities, organizations and individuals.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Mining in the Parks Act.</E> If the NPS determines that an entire or partial national natural landmark may be irreparably lost or destroyed by surface mining activity, including exploration for or removal or production of minerals or materials, NPS notifies the person that is conducting the activity and prepares a report that identifies the basis for the finding that the activity may cause irreparable loss or destruction. The NPS also notifies the owner(s) of the national natural landmark in writing of its finding. The NPS submits to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation the report and a request for advice about alternative measures that may be taken by the United States to mitigate or abate the activity. The authority for this action is contained in Section 9 of the Mining in the Parks Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1908).</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">National Environmental Policy Act.</E> Federal agencies should consider the existence and location of designated national natural landmarks, and of areas found to meet the criteria for national significance, in assessing the effects of their activities on the environment under section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321). The NPS is responsible for providing requested information about the National Natural Landmarks Program for these assessments.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 62.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Natural landmark modifications.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Determination of need for modifications.</E> After designation, the modification of the boundaries of a natural landmark, and/or revision of information about it, may be appropriate. For example, because of new information or changes in the condition of an NNL, the boundary may have to be reduced or expanded or information about the NNL may have to be revised. Additional study may reveal that the area has nationally significant values that had not been previously documented. The NPS determines that landmark modifications are necessary through administration of the program. In addition, the NPS may receive suggestions for landmark modifications from other Federal agencies, State natural area programs, and other public and private organizations or individuals. The NPS determines the validity of these suggestions by applying the natural landmark criteria or by conducting additional study.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Boundary expansion.</E> (1) Three justifications exist for enlarging the boundary of a national natural landmark: better documentation of the extent of nationally significant features, professional error in the original designation, or additional landowners with nationally significant features on their property desiring the designation.</P>
          <P>(2) If the NPS determines that an expansion of the boundary of the national natural landmark is appropriate, it will use the designation process outlined in § 62.4(b) through (j). If a boundary is expanded, only the owners in the newly considered but as yet not designated portion of the area are notified and asked if they object to designation.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Boundary reduction.</E> Two justifications exist for reducing the boundary of a national natural landmark: Loss of integrity of the natural features or professional error in the original designation. If the NPS determines that a reduction in the national natural landmark boundary is indicated, the designation removal process outlined in § 62.8 is used.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Change in description of values.</E> If the NPS determines that a change in the description of the national natural landmark's nationally significant values is warranted, the NPS prepares the recommended changes and the Director submits the changes and all supportive documentation to the National Park System Advisory Board. The Advisory Board reviews the information submitted by the Director and makes recommendations to the Secretary. The Secretary reviews the supportive documentation and the recommendations of the board, and may approve changes in the description of a landmark's nationally significant values.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Minor technical corrections.</E> Minor technical corrections to a national natural landmark boundary and other administrative changes in landmark documentation not covered under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section may be approved by the Director without a review by the Advisory Board or <PRTPAGE P="391"/>the approval by the Secretary. Minor technical boundary corrections are defined as those that involve a change in less than five percent of the total area of the national natural landmark. The NPS notifies owners of proposed minor technical boundary corrections or other administrative changes in documentation, as described in this paragraph (e). Based upon owner response to this notification, the NPS determines whether the proposed change is a minor technical correction to landmark documentation that can be made administratively or whether the procedures outlined in § 62.4(d) through (j) must be followed.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 62.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Natural landmark designation removal.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Criteria for removal.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, national natural landmark designation is removed from an area:</P>
          <P>(i) When it can be shown that an error in professional judgment was made such that the site did not meet the criteria for national significance at the time of designation;</P>
          <P>(ii) When the values which originally qualified it for designation have been lost or destroyed; or</P>
          <P>(iii) When applicable designation procedures were not followed because of prejudicial failure.</P>
          <P>(2) Any affected owner of a designated national natural landmark may initiate the removal by submitting to the Director a request for removal of designation, stating the grounds for this removal and specifying the error in professional judgment, loss of natural values or prejudicial procedural error. A prejudicial procedural error is one that reasonably may be considered to have affected the outcome of the designation process.</P>
          <P>(3) Within 60 days of receiving a removal request, the NPS notifies the party submitting the request of whether the NPS considers the documentation sufficient to consider removal of the natural landmark designation.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Review of removal information.</E> The NPS reviews the information outlining the grounds for removal. When necessary, an on-site evaluation of the area may be made, as outlined in § 62.4(c). Based on all available information, the NPS determines whether the area no longer merits designation as a national natural landmark.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Notifications.</E> When NPS has determined that area no longer merits designation as a national natural landmark, the NPS notifies the owner(s) and other interested parties as specified in § 62.4(d)(1)-(3). Notice of the proposed removal is also published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The notified individuals may comment within 60 days of the date of the notice before a recommendation for removal is submitted to the Secretary. All comments received will be considered in the review and in the decision to remove the national natural landmark designation.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Removal from the registry.</E> (1) The Director reviews the information about a recommended removal from the Registry and determines whether the procedural requirements in this section have been met. If the Director confirms the findings, he or she submits a recommendation for removal to the National Park System Advisory Board. The Advisory Board reviews the submitted information and recommends the removal from or retention of the area in the registry.</P>
          <P>(2) The recommendations of the Advisory Board and the Director are submitted by the Director to the Secretary for his or her consideration. If the Secretary concurs, he or she directs the removal of the landmark from the National Registry of Natural Landmarks. Any area from which designation is withdrawn solely because of procedural error as described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section continues to meet the criteria for national significance.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Notification of removal from the registry.</E> When the Secretary removes a landmark from the National Registry of Natural Landmarks, the Secretary will notify the national natural landmark owner(s), the executive of the local government jurisdiction in which the area is located, Native American tribal governments and native villages and corporations in the area, the governor of the State, Congressional members who represent the Congressional District and State in which the area is located, and other interested authorities, organizations, and individuals, as <PRTPAGE P="392"/>outlined in § 62.4(d)(1), (2) and (3). The NPS is responsible for preparing and distributing the written notices. The NPS periodically publishes notice(s) of removal in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The NPS may reclaim the natural landmark plaque when a landmark is removed from the National Registry of Natural Landmarks.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Previously designated landmarks.</E> (1) NPS will notify owners of national natural landmarks designated before the effective date of these regulations to give them an opportunity within 90 days of the notice to request the removal of a national natural landmark designation from their property by writing to the Director. If owners do not respond within 90 days of the notification, the national natural landmark designations of their properties will be retained.</P>
          <P>(2) When only some owners of a national natural landmark in multiple ownership request the removal of a national natural landmark designation from their portions, the NPS determines whether, after removal of these portions, a sufficient acreage of the national natural landmark remains to demonstrate the original nationally significant features without undue compromise. If so, the boundaries of the national natural landmark are adjusted to remove the properties of owners who object to the designation. If not, the entire national natural landmark designation is removed and the area is removed from the National Registry of Natural Landmarks.</P>
          <P>(3) Any removals of existing national natural landmark designations and related recommended boundary adjustments, must be presented by the Director to the National Park System Advisory Board for review before being presented to the Secretary who formally removes a national natural landmark from the national registry or approves changes in the national natural landmark boundary. Areas from which the designation has been removed may be reconsidered for designation under these regulations if ownership or other circumstances change.</P>

          <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Agreements.</E> The NPS may enter into contracts, memoranda of agreement, cooperative agreements, or other types of agreements with other Federal agencies, States, counties, local communities, private organizations, owners, Native American tribal governments, or other interested individuals or groups to assist in administering the National Natural Landmarks Program. The agreements may include but are not limited to provisions about identification, evaluation, monitoring or protecting national natural landmarks.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Information dissemination.</E> The NPS may conduct educational and scientific activities to disseminate information on national natural landmarks, the National Natural Landmarks Program, and the benefits derived from systematic surveys of significant natural features to the general public and to interested local, State and Federal agencies and private groups. Dissemination of information on ecologically or geologically fragile or sensitive areas may be restricted when release of the information may endanger or harm the sensitive resources.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedural requirements.</E> Any individual, agency, or organization acting as a representative of the NPS in the identification, evaluation, monitoring or protection of national natural landmarks is required to follow this part.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional program information.</E> Further guidance on the operation of the National Natural Landmarks Program, as based on this part, may be found in other program documents that are available from the NPS.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Administrative recourse.</E> Any person has the right to insist that NPS take into account all the provisions in this part for national natural landmark designation or removal.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose and authorities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) These regulations have been developed to assist Federal agencies in identifying and evaluating the eligibility of properties for inclusion in the National Register. The regulations explain how to request determinations of eligibility under section 2(b) of Executive Order 11593 and the regulations of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (36 CFR part 800) for implementation of sections 1(3) and 2(b) of Executive Order 11593 and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended Federal agencies request determinations of eligibility in considering historic properties on lands under their jurisdiction or control or on lands to be affected by proposed actions.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 63.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Determination of eligibility process.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The Department of the Interior will respond within 45 days of receipt of a documented request for a determination of eligibility from a Federal agency when it is submitted in accordance with the following regulations and is accompanied by documentation that clearly portrays the nature and significance of the property.</P>
          <P>(a) The agency shall consult the State Historic Preservation Officer as the first step in identifying historic properties for information concerning:</P>
          <P>(1) Properties listed in the National Register.</P>
          <P>(2) Properties in the process of nomination to the National Register.</P>
          <P>(3) Properties determined eligible by the Secretary of the Interior for listing in the National Register.</P>
          <P>(4) Any other available information that would assist in identifying properties in the area affected by the proposed action.</P>

          <P>(b) If the State Historic Preservation Officer has inadequate information to document the presence or absence of historic properties in the project area, the Federal agency should refer to the Department of the Interior's criteria for the identification of historic properties and the guidelines for level of documentation to accompany requests for determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the National Register published as a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall, in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, apply the National Register Criteria for Evaluation contained in 36 CFR 60.6 to all potentially eligible properties that may be affected by the proposed action. If a property appears to meet the Criteria and the State Historic Preservation Officer agrees, the agency should follow the procedures in § 63.3. If there is a question whether the Criteria are met, the agency shall complete the procedures in § 63.3(d). A question on whether a property meets the Criteria exists when the agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer disagree or when the agency determines that a question exists. The Department of the Interior will provide general and specific advice concerning the identification of historic properties and will bring to the attention of a Federal agency any information received from the public regarding potential historic properties in the area affected by its plans or projects.</P>
          <P>(d) The agency shall submit a letter of request for a determination of eligibility with a description, statement of significance, photographs, and a map, or a statement in accord with § 63.3 below, if applicable, directly to the Keeper of the National Register, National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240. If available, the opinion of the State Historic Preservation Officer on the eligibility of the property should also be forwarded with the request.</P>

          <P>(e) The Keeper, National Register, will respond in writing to the agency's request within 45 days of receipt of a documented request submitted in accord with § 63.2(d) of these procedures. <PRTPAGE P="394"/>If the opinion of the State Historic Preservation Officer is not included with the request, the Keeper of the National Register will provide to the State Historic Preservation Officer a copy of the request and will ask for his opinion on the property. If the Keeper does not receive the State Historic Preservation Officer's response within three weeks of the State Historic Preservation Officer's receipt of a letter from the Keeper requesting an opinion, the Keeper will proceed with the determination and will inform the agency that the State Historic Preservation Officer did not give an opinion. If the Keeper of the National Register determines that documentation submitted with the request is not sufficient to make a professional evaluation of the significance of the property, he will advise the agency in writing of the additional information needed. The Keeper of the National Register will respond to the agency's request within 45 days of receipt of documentation on the property requested by the Keeper.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Procedures to be applied when the Agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer agree a property is eligible.</SUBJECT>
          <P>If during the consultation described in § 63.2(c), both the agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer agree that a property meets the Criteria, the Federal agency or the State Historic Preservation Officer shall forward to the Keeper of the National Register (a) a letter signed by the agency stating that the agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer agree that the property is eligible for inclusion in the National Register, and (b) a statement signed by the State Historic Preservation Officer that in his opinion the property is eligible for the National Register. Either the letter or the statement must contain substantive information on the property, including a description, specific boundaries, its significance under National Register Criteria, and an explanation of why the property is eligible for listing in the National Register. The Keeper of the National Register shall give written notice of his determination to both the agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer within 10 working days of receipt. If the property has not been accurately identified and evaluated, the Keeper will inform the agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer within 10 working days and will recommend that the agency follow the process set forth at § 63.2. Notwithstanding such recommendation, the Federal agency or the Keeper of the National Register may consider the property eligible for the purpose of obtaining the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's comments. Documentation concerning properties determined eligible for the National Register shall be kept on file by the agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Other properties on which determinations of eligibility may be made by the Secretary of the Interior.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Keeper of the National Register will make determinations of eligibility on properties nominated by Federal agencies under section 2(a) of Executive Order 11593 prior to returning the nominations for such properties to the agency for technical or professional revision or because of procedural requirements. Such determinations of eligibility will be made only if sufficient information exists to establish the significance of the property and its eligibility for the National Register</P>

          <P>(b) Any property or district removed from the National Register for procedural deficiencies in the nomination and/or listing process shall automatically be considered eligible for inclusion in the National Register without further action and will be published as such in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

          <P>The Keeper of the National Register will conduct an annual review of the condition of properties determined eligible for the National Register. The Keeper of the National Register will obtain from the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation information on decisions made concerning eligible properties in accord with memorandum of agreement under the Council's “Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties” (36 CFR part 800). If there is no memorandum of agreement or if no provision has been made in a memorandum of agreement for nomination of an eligible property and if the property retains the characteristics that made it eligible for the National Register, the Keeper of the National Register will take the following steps:</P>
          <P>(a) For a property owned by a Federal agency, or under the jurisdiction or control of the agency to the extent that the agency substantially exercises the attributes of ownership, the Keeper of the National Register will request the Federal agency to nominate the property to the National Register within six months.</P>
          <P>(b) If the property is not under Federal jurisdiction or control, the Keeper of the National Register will request that the State Historic Preservation Office nominate the property to the National Register within six months.</P>
          <P>(c) If the Keeper of the National Register determines that a property has lost the characteristics that made it eligible for the National Register, he will inform the State Historic Preservation Officer and the Federal agency and remove the property from the list of eligible properties.</P>

Financial assistance may be terminated upon determination by the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation that satisfactory progress has not been maintained.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Acquisition Procedures.</E> All acquisition must conform to the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, Pub. L. 91-646, as set forth in the Bureau of Outdoor recreation Manual, part 645. Real property must be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, and the property owner given a statement of just compensation for his property. In no event can the amount established as just compensation be less than the fair market value established by the approved appraisal.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Appraisals.</E> The State or local applicant should secure at least one appraisal of the appropriate type by a qualified professional appraiser for each parcel to be acquired. Standards for appraisals shall be consistent with the current Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisition, published by the Land Acquisition Conference and as set forth in Bureau of Outdoor Recreation Manual, paragraph 675.2.5.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Appraisal Review.</E> The appraisal will be reviewed and approved by a qualified staff or fee appraiser prior to the initiation of negotiations. The Bureau reserves the right to review all appraisal documentation prior to or after the acquisition.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Record Retention.</E> All documentation supporting the acquisition of land and improvements, or interests therein, must be kept available for examination by duly authorized representatives of the Bureau, the Department of the Interior and the General Accounting Office. All such records shall be retained and be available for inspection for a period of three years after final payment by the Federal Government.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Development Procedures.</E> Development work may be accomplished by contract or by force account. Allowable construction costs cover all necessary construction activities, from site preparation to completion of the facility.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Construction by Force Account.</E> Labor costs charged to a project for force account work will be based on payrolls documented and approved in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices of the State or local agency. Payrolls must be supported by time and attendance or equivalent records for individual employees. Salaries and wages of employee chargeable to more than one cost objective will be supported by appropriate time distribution records. The method used should produce an equitable distribution of time and effort. Costs for equipment owned by the participant may be charged against the project based on an equipment use rate developed by the participant in accordance with guidelines provided by the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation. Other costs such as material costs will be charged to a project as outlined in OMB Circular A-102 and the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation Manual, part 670.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Construction by Contract</E>—(i) <E T="03">Bids and Awards.</E> Competitive open bidding shall be required for contracts in excess of $10,000 in accordance with Attachment O of OMB Circular A-102.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose and authority.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The purpose of the National Historic Landmarks Program is to identify and designate National Historic Landmarks, and encourage the long range preservation of nationally significant properties that illustrate or commemorate the history and prehistory of the United States. These regulations set forth the criteria for establishing national significance and the procedures used by the Department of the Interior for conducting the National Historic Landmarks Program.</P>

          <P>(a) In the Historic Sites Act of 1935 (45 Stat. 666, 16 U.S.C. 461 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) the Congress declared that it is a national policy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings and objects of national significance for the inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States and</P>
          <P>(b) To implement the policy, the Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to perform the following duties and functions, among others:</P>
          <P>(1) To make a survey of historic and archeological sites, buildings and objects for the purpose of determining which possess exceptional value as commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States;</P>
          <P>(2) To make necessary investigations and researches in the United States relating to particular sites, buildings or objects to obtain true and accurate historical and archeological facts and information concerning the same; and</P>
          <P>(3) To erect and maintain tablets to mark or commemorate historic or prehistoric places and events of national historical or archeological significance.</P>
          <P>(c) The National Park Service (NPS) administers the National Historic Landmarks Program on behalf of the Secretary.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 65.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Effects of designation.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The purpose of the National Historic Landmarks Program is to focus attention on properties of exceptional value to the nation as a whole rather than to a particular State or locality. The program recognizes and promotes the preservation efforts of Federal, State and local agencies, as well as of private organizations and individuals and encourages the owners of landmark properties to observe preservation precepts.</P>
          <P>(b) Properties designated as National Historic Landmarks are listed in the National Register of Historic Places upon designation as National Historic Landmarks. Listing of private property on the National Register does not prohibit under Federal law or regulations any actions which may otherwise be taken by the property owner with respect to the property.</P>
          <P>(c) Specific effects of designation are:</P>

          <P>(1) The National Register was designed to be and is administered as a planning tool. Federal agencies undertaking a project having an effect on a listed or eligible property must provide the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment pursuant to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. The Advisory Council has adopted procedures concerning, <E T="03">inter alia,</E> their commenting responsibility in 36 CFR part 800.</P>
          <P>(2) Section 110(f) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, requires that before approval of any Federal undertaking which may directly and adversely affect any National Historic Landmark, the head of the responsible Federal agency shall, to the maximum extent possible, undertake such planning and actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to such landmark, and shall afford the Advisory Council a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking.</P>
          <P>(3) Listing in the National Register makes property owners eligible to be considered for Federal grants-in-aid and loan guarantees (when implemented) for historic preservation.</P>
          <P>(4) If a property is listed in the National Register, certain special Federal income tax provisions may apply to the owners of the property pursuant to section 2124 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 and the Tax Treatment Extension Act of 1980.</P>
          <P>(5) If a property contains surface coal resources and is listed in the National Register, certain provisions of the Surface Mining and Control Act of 1977 require consideration of a property's historic values in determining issuance of a surface coal mining permit.</P>
          <P>(6) Section 8 of the National Park System General Authorities Act of 1970, as amended (90 Stat. 1940, 16 U.S.C. 1-5), directs the Secretary to prepare an annual report to Congress which identifies all National Historic Landmarks that exhibit known or anticipated damage or threats to the integrity of their resources. In addition, National Historic Landmarks may be studied by NPS for possible recommendation to Congress for inclusion in the National Park System.</P>
          <P>(7) Section 9 of the Mining in the National Parks Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 1342, 16 U.S.C. 1980) directs the Secretary of the Interior to submit to the Advisory Council a report on any surface mining activity which the Secretary has determined may destroy a National Historic Landmark in whole or in part, and to request the advisory Council's advice on alternative measures to mitigate or abate such activity.</P>

          <SUBJECT>National Historic Landmark criteria.</SUBJECT>

          <P>The criteria applied to evaluate properties for possible designation as National Historic Landmarks or possible determination of eligibility for National Historic Landmark designation are listed below. These criteria shall be used by NPS in the preparation, review and evaluation of National Historic Landmark studies. They shall be used by the Advisory Board in reviewing National Historic Landmark studies and preparing recommendations to the Secretary. Properties shall be designated National Historic Landmarks only if they are nationally significant. Although assessments of national significance should reflect both public perceptions and professional judgments, the evaluations of properties being considered for landmark designation are <PRTPAGE P="405"/>undertaken by professionals, including historians, architectural historians, archeologists and anthropologists familiar with the broad range of the nation's resources and historical themes. The criteria applied by these specialists to potential landmarks do not define significance nor set a rigid standard for quality. Rather, the criteria establish the qualitative framework in which a comparative professional analysis of national significance can occur. The final decision on whether a property possesses national significance is made by the Secretary on the basis of documentation including the comments and recommendations of the public who participate in the designation process.</P>
          <P>(a) Specific Criteria of National Significance: The quality of national significance is ascribed to districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects that possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States in history, architecture, archeology, engineering and culture and that possess a high degree of integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association, and:</P>
          <P>(1) That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to, and are identified with, or that outstandingly represent, the broad national patterns of United States history and from which an understanding and appreciation of those patterns may be gained; or</P>
          <P>(2) That are associated importantly with the lives of persons nationally significant in the history of the United States; or</P>
          <P>(3) That represent some great idea or ideal of the American people; or</P>
          <P>(4) That embody the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type specimen exceptionally valuable for a study of a period, style or method of construction, or that represent a significant, distinctive and exceptional entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or</P>
          <P>(5) That are composed of integral parts of the environment not sufficiently significant by reason of historical association or artistic merit to warrant individual recognition but collectively compose an entity of exceptional historical or artistic significance, or outstandingly commemorate or illustrate a way of life or culture; or</P>
          <P>(6) That have yielded or may be likely to yield information of major scientific importance by revealing new cultures, or by shedding light upon periods of occupation over large areas of the United States. Such sites are those which have yielded, or which may reasonably be expected to yield, data affecting theories, concepts and ideas to a major degree.</P>
          <P>(b) Ordinarily, cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historic buildings and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years are not eligible for designation. Such properties, however, will qualify if they fall within the following categories:</P>
          <P>(1) A religious property deriving its primary national significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance; or</P>
          <P>(2) A building or structure removed from its original location but which is nationally significant primarily for its architectural merit, or for association with persons or events of transcendent importance in the nation's history and the association consequential; or</P>
          <P>(3) A site of a building or structure no longer standing but the person or event associated with it is of transcendent importance in the nation's history and the association consequential; or</P>
          <P>(4) A birthplace, grave or burial if it is of a historical figure of transcendent national significance and no other appropriate site, building or structure directly associated with the productive life of that person exists; or</P>
          <P>(5) A cemetery that derives its primary national significance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, or from an exceptionally distinctive design or from an exceptionally significant event; or</P>

          <P>(6) A reconstructed building or ensemble of buildings of extraordinary national significance when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when <PRTPAGE P="406"/>no other buildings or structures with the same association have survived; or</P>
          <P>(7) A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own national historical significance; or</P>
          <P>(8) A property achieving national significance within the past 50 years if it is of extraordinary national importance.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Designation of National Historic Landmarks.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Potential National Historic Landmarks are identified primarily by means of theme studies and in some instances by special studies. Nominations and recommendations made by the appropriate State officials, Federal Preservation Officers and other interested parties will be considered in scheduling and conducting studies.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Theme studies.</E> NPS defines and systematically conducts organized theme studies which encompass the major aspects of American history. The theme studies provide a contextual framework to evaluate the relative significance of historic properties and determine which properties meet National Historic Landmark criteria. Theme studies will be announced in advance through direct notice to appropriate State officials, Federal Preservation Officers and other interested parties and by notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Within the established thematic framework, NPS will schedule and conduct National Historic Landmark theme studies according to the following priorities. Themes which meet more of these priorities ordinarily will be studied before those which meet fewer of the priorities:</P>
          <P>(1) Theme studies not yet begun as identified in “History and Prehistory in the National Park System,” 1982.</P>
          <P>(2) Theme studies in serious need of revision.</P>
          <P>(3) Theme studies which relate to a significant number of properties listed in the National Register bearing opinions of State Historic Preservation Officers and Federal Preservation Officers that such properties are of potential national significance. (Only those recommendations which NPS determines are likely to meet the landmarks criteria will be enumerated in determining whether a significant number exists in a theme study.)</P>
          <P>(4) Themes which reflect the broad planning needs of NPS and other Federal agencies and for which the funds to conduct the study are made available from sources other than the regularly programmed funds of the National Historic Landmarks Program.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Special Studies.</E> NPS will conduct special studies for historic properties outside of active theme studies according to the following priorities:</P>
          <P>(1) Studies authorized by Congress or mandated by Executive Order will receive the highest priority.</P>
          <P>(2) Properties which NPS determines are endangered and potentially meet the National Historic Landmarks criteria, whether or not the theme in which they are significant has been studied.</P>
          <P>(3) Properties listed in the National Register bearing State or Federal agency recommendations of potential national significance where NPS concurs in the evaluation and the property is significant in a theme already studied.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) When a property is selected for study to determine its potential for designation as a National Historic Landmark, NPS will notify in writing, except as provided below, (i) the owner(s), (ii) the chief elected local official, (iii) the appropriate State official, (iv) the Members of Congress who represent the district and State in which the property is located, and, (v) if the property is on an Indian reservation, the chief executive officer of the Indian tribe, that it will be studied to determine its potential for designation as a National Historic Landmark. This notice will provide information on the National Historic Landmarks Program, the designation process and the effects of designation.</P>

          <P>(2) When the property has more than 50 owners, NPS will notify in writing (i) the chief elected local official, (ii) the appropriate State official, (iii) the Members of Congress who represent the district and State in which the property is located, and, (iv) if the property is on an Indian reservation, the chief executive officer of the Indian tribe, and (v) provide general notice to the property owners. This general notice <PRTPAGE P="407"/>will be published in one or more local newspapers of general circulation in the area in which the potential National Historic Landmark is located and will provide information on the National Historic Landmarks Program, the designation process and the effects of designation. The researcher will visit each property selected for study unless it is determined that an onsite investigation is not necessary. In the case of districts with more than 50 owners NPS may conduct a public information meeting if widespread public interest so warrants or on request by the chief elected local official.</P>
          <P>(3) Properties for which a study was conducted before the effective date of these regulations are not subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(4) The results of each study will be incorporated into a report which will contain at least</P>
          <P>(i) A precise description of the property studied; and</P>
          <P>(ii) An analysis of the significance of the property and its relationship to the National Historic Landmark criteria.</P>
          <P>(d)(1) Properties appearing to qualify for designation as National Historic Landmarks will be presented to the Advisory Board for evaluation except as specified in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) Before the Advisory Board's review of a property, NPS will provide written notice of this review, except as provided below, and a copy of the study report to (i) the owner(s) of record; (ii) the appropriate State official; (iii) the chief elected local official; (iv) the Members of Congress who represent the district and State in which the property is located; and, (v) if the property is located on an Indian reservation, the chief executive officer of the Indian tribe. The list of owners shall be obtained from official land or tax record, whichever is most appropriate, within 90 days prior to the notification of intent to submit to the Advisory Board. If in any State the land or tax record is not the appropriate list an alternative source of owners may be used. NPS is responsible for notifying only those owners whose names appear on the list. Where there is more than one owner on the list each separate owner shall be notified.</P>

          <P>(3) In the case of a property with more than 50 owners, NPS will notify, in writing, (i) the appropriate State official; (ii) the chief elected local official; (iii) the Members of Congress who represent the district and State in which the property is located; (iv) if the property is located on an Indian reservation, the chief executive officer of the Indian tribe; and, (v) will provide general notice to the property owners. The general notice will be published in one or more local newspapers of general circulation in the area in which the property is located. A copy of the study report will be made available on request. Notice of Advisory Board review will also be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>

          <P>(4) Notice of Advisory Board review will be given at least 60 days in advance of the Advisory Board meeting. The notice will state date, time and location of the meeting; solicit written comments and recommendations on the study report; provide information on the National Historic Landmarks Program, the designation process and the effects of designation and provide the owners of private property not more than 60 days in which to concur in or object in writing to the designation. Notice of Advisory Board meetings and the agenda will also be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Interested parties are encouraged to submit written comments and recommendations which will be presented to the Advisory Board. Interested parties may also attend the Advisory Board meeting and upon request will be given an opportunity to address the Board concerning a property's significance, integrity and proposed boundaries.</P>

          <P>(5) Upon notification, any owner of private property who wishes to object shall submit to the Chief, History Division, a notarized statement that the party is the sole or partial owner of record of the property, as appropriate, and objects to the designations. Such notice shall be submitted during the 60-day commenting period. Upon receipt of notarized objections respecting a district or an individual property with multiple ownership it is the responsibility of NPS to ascertain whether a <PRTPAGE P="408"/>majority of owners have so objected. If an owner whose name did not appear on the list certifies in a written notarized statement that the party is the sole or partial owner of a nominated private property such owner shall be counted by NPS in determining whether a majority of owners has objected. Each owner of private property in a district has one vote regardless of how many properties or what part of one property that party owns and regardless of whether the property contributes to the significance of the district.</P>
          <P>(6) The commenting period following notification can be waived only when all property owners and the chief elected local official have agreed in writing to the waiver.</P>
          <P>(e)(1) The Advisory Board evaluates such factors as a property's significance, integrity, proposed boundaries and the professional adequacy of the study. If the Board finds that these conditions are met, it may recommend to the Secretary that a property be designated or declared eligible for designation as a National Historic Landmark. If one or more of the conditions are not met, the Board may recommend that the property not be designated a landmark or that consideration of it be deferred for further study, as appropriate. In making its recommendation, the Board shall state, if possible, whether or not it finds that the criteria of the landmarks program have been met. A simple majority is required to make a recommendation of designation. The Board's recommendations are advisory.</P>
          <P>(2) Studies submitted to the Advisory Board (or the Consulting Committee previously under the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service) before the effective date of these regulations need not be resubmitted to the Advisory Board. In such instances, if a property appears to qualify for designation, NPS will provide notice and a copy of the study report to the parties as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section and will provide at least 30 days in which to submit written comments and to provide an opportunity for owners to concur in or object to the designation.</P>
          <P>(3) The Director reviews the study report and the Advisory Board recommendations, certifies that the procedural requirements set forth in this section have been met and transmits the study reports, the recommendations of the Advisory Board, his recommendations and any other recommendations and comments received pertaining to the properties to the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(f) The Secretary reviews the nominations, recommendations and any comments and, based on the criteria set forth herein, makes a decision on National Historic Landmark designation. Properties that are designated National Historic Landmarks are entered in the National Register of Historic Places, if not already so listed.</P>
          <P>(1) If the private owner or, with respect to districts or individual properties with multiple ownership, the majority of such owners have objected to the designation by notarized statements, the Secretary shall not make a National Historic Landmark designation but shall review the nomination and make a determination of its eligibility for National Historic Landmark designation.</P>
          <P>(2) The Secretary may thereafter designate such properties as National Historic Landmarks only upon receipt of notarized statements from the private owner (or majority of private owners in the event of a district or a single property with multiple ownership) that they do not object to the designation.</P>
          <P>(3) The Keeper may list in the National Register properties considered for National Historic Landmark designation which do not meet the National Historic Landmark criteria but which do meet the National Register criteria for evaluation in 36 CFR part 60 or determine such properties eligible for the National Register if the private owners or majority of such owners in the case of districts object to designation. A property determined eligible for National Historic Landmark designation is determined eligible for the National Register.</P>

          <P>(g) Notice of National Historic Landmark designation, National Register listing, or a determination of eligibility will be sent in the same manner as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section. For properties which are determined eligible the Advisory <PRTPAGE P="409"/>Council will also be notified. Notice will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(h)(1) The Secretary may designate a National Historic Landmark without Advisory Board review through accelerated procedures described in this section when necessary to assist in the preservation of a nationally significant property endangered by a threat of imminent damage or destruction.</P>
          <P>(2) NPS will conduct the study and prepare a study report as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) If a property appears to qualify for designation, the National Park Service will provide notice and a copy of the study report to the parties specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) and will allow at least 30 days for the submittal of written comments and to provide owners of private property an opportunity to concur in or object to designation as provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section except that the commenting period may be less than 60 days.</P>
          <P>(4) The Director will review the study report and any comments, will certify that procedural requirements have been met, and will transmit the study report, his and any other recommendations and comments pertaining to the property to the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(5) The Secretary will review the nomination and recommendations and any comments and, based on the criteria set forth herein, make a decision on National Historic Landmark designation or a determination of eligibility for designation if the private owners or a majority of such owners of historic districts object.</P>
          <P>(6) Notice of National Historic Landmark designation or a determination of eligibility will be sent to the same parties specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 65.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Recognition of National Historic Landmarks.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Following designation of a property by the Secretary as a National Historic Landmark, the owner(s) will receive a certificate of designation. In the case of a district, the certificate will be delivered to the chief elected local official or other local official, or to the chief officer of a private organization involved with the preservation of the district, or the chief officer of an organization representing the owners of the district, as appropriate.</P>
          <P>(b) NPS will invite the owner of each designated National Historic Landmark to accept, free of charge, a landmark plaque. In the case of a district, the chief elected local official or other local official, or the chief officer of an organization involved in the preservation of the district, or chief officer of an organization representing the owners of the district, as appropriate, may accept the plaque on behalf of the owners. A plaque will be presented to properties where the appropriate recipient(s) (from those listed above) agrees to display it publicly and appropriately.</P>
          <P>(c) The appropriate recipient(s) may accept the plaque at any time after designation of the National Historic Landmark. In so doing owners give up none of the rights and privileges of ownership or use of the landmark property nor does the Department of the Interior acquire any interest in property so designated.</P>
          <P>(d) NPS will provide one standard certificate and plaque for each designated National Historic Landmark. The certificate and plaque remain the property of NPS. Should the National Historic Landmark designation at any time be withdrawn, in accordance with the procedures specified in § 65.9 of these rules, or should the certificate and plaque not be publicly or appropriately displayed, the certificate and the plaque, if issued, will be reclaimed by NPS.</P>
          <P>(e) Upon request, and if feasible, NPS will help arrange and participate in a presentation ceremony.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Monitoring National Historic Landmarks.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) NPS maintains a continuing relationship with the owners of National Historic Landmarks. Periodic visits, contacts with State Historic Preservation Officers, and other appropriate means will be used to determine whether landmarks retain their integrity, to advise owners concerning accepted preservation standards and techniques and to update administrative records on the properties.<PRTPAGE P="410"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) Reports of monitoring activities form the basis for the annual report submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Interior, as mandated by section 8, National Park System General Authorities Act of 1970, as amended (90 Stat. 1940, 16 U.S.C. 1a-5). The Secretary's annual report will identify those National Historic Landmarks which exhibit known or anticipated damage or threats to their integrity. In evaluating National Historic Landmarks for listing in the report, the seriousness and imminence of the damage or threat are considered, as well as the integrity of the landmark at the time of designation taking into account the criteria in § 65.4.</P>
          <P>(c) As mandated in section 9, Mining in the National Parks Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 1342, 16 U.S.C. 1980), whenever the Secretary of the Interior finds that a National Historic Landmark may be irreparably lost or destroyed in whole or in part by any surface mining activity, including exploration for, removal or production of minerals or materials, the Secretary shall (1) notify the person conducting such activity of that finding;</P>
          <P>(2) Submit a report thereon, including the basis for his finding that such activity may cause irreparable loss or destruction of a National Historic Landmark, to the Advisory Council; and</P>
          <P>(3) Request from the Council advice as to alternative measures that may be taken by the United States to mitigate or abate such activity.</P>
          <P>(d) Monitoring activities described in this section, including the preparation of the mandated reports to Congress and the Advisory Council are carried out by NPS regional offices under the direction of the Preservation Assistance Division, NPS [Address: Chief, Resource Assistance Division, National Park Service, 440 G Street NW, Washington, DC 20243] in consultation with the History Division, NPS.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Alteration of National Historic Landmark boundaries.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Two justifications exist for enlarging the boundary of a National Historic Landmark:</E> Documentation of previously unrecognized significance or professional error in the original designation. Enlargement of a boundary will be approved only when the area proposed for addition to the National Historic Landmark possesses or contributes directly to the characteristics for which the landmark was designated.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Two justifications exist for reducing the boundary of a National Historic Landmark:</E> Loss of integrity or professional error in the original designation. Reduction of a boundary will be approved only when the area to be deleted from the National Historic Landmark does not possess or has lost the characteristics for which the landmark was designated.</P>
          <P>(c) A proposal for enlargement or reduction of a National Historic Landmark boundary may be submitted to or can originate with the History Division, NPS. NPS may restudy the National Historic Landmark and subsequently make a proposal, if appropriate, in the same manner as specified in § 65.5 (c) through (h). In the case of boundary enlargements only those owners in the newly nominated but as yet undesignated area will be notified and will be counted in determining whether a majority of private owners object to listing.</P>

          <P>(d)(1) When a boundary is proposed for a National Historic Landmark for which no specific boundary was identified at the time of designation, NPS shall provide notice, in writing, of the proposed boundary to (i) the owner(s); (ii) the appropriate State official; (iii) the chief elected local official; (iv) the Members of Congress who represent the district and State in which the landmark is located, and (v) if the property is located on an Indian reservation, the chief executive officer of the Indian tribe, and shall allow not less than 30 nor more than 60 days for submitting written comments on the proposal. In the case of a landmark with more than 50 owners, the general notice specified in § 65.5(d)(3) will be used. In the case of National Historic Landmark districts for which no boundaries have been established, proposed boundaries shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for comment and be submitted to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and to the Committee on Interior and <PRTPAGE P="411"/>Insular Affairs of the United States House of Representatives and not less than 30 nor more than 60 days shall be provided for the submittal of written comments on the proposed boundaries.</P>
          <P>(2) The proposed boundary and any comments received thereon shall be submitted to the Associated Director for National Register Programs, NPS, who may approve the boundary without reference to the Advisory Board or the Secretary.</P>

          <P>(3) NPS will provide written notice of the approved boundary to the same parties specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(4) Management of the activities described in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section is handled by the National Register of Historic Places, NPS, [Address: National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240].</P>
          <P>(e) A technical correction to a boundary may be approved by the Chief, History Division, without Advisory Board review or Secretarial approval. NPS will provide notice, in writing, of any technical correction in a boundary to the same parties specified in (d)(1).</P>

          <SUBJECT>Withdrawal of National Historic Landmark designation.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) National Historic Landmarks will be considered for withdrawal of designation only at the request of the owner or upon the initiative of the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(b) Four justifications exist for the withdrawal of National Historic Landmark designation:</P>
          <P>(1) The property has ceased to meet the criteria for designation because the qualities which caused it to be originally designated have been lost or destroyed, or such qualities were lost subsequent to nomination, but before designation;</P>
          <P>(2) Additional information shows conclusively that the property does not possess sufficient significance to meet the National Historic Landmark criteria;</P>
          <P>(3) Professional error in the designation; and</P>
          <P>(4) Prejudicial procedural error in the designation process.</P>
          <P>(c) Properties designated as National Historic Landmarks before December 13, 1980, can be dedesignated only on the grounds established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(d) The owner may appeal to have a property dedesignated by submitting a request for dedesignation and stating the grounds for the appeal as established in subsection (a) to the Chief, History Division, National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240. An appellant will receive a response within 60 days as to whether NPS considers the documentation sufficient to initiate a restudy of the landmark.</P>
          <P>(e) The Secretary may initiate a restudy of a National Historic Landmark and subsequently a proposal for withdrawal of the landmark designation as appropriate in the same manner as a new designation as specified in § 65.5 (c) through (h). Proposals will not be submitted to the Advisory Board if the grounds for removal are procedural, although the Board will be informed of such proposals.</P>
          <P>(f)(1) The property will remain listed in the National Register if the Keeper determines that it meets the National Register criteria for evaluation in 36 CFR 60.4, except if the property is redesignated on procedural grounds.</P>

          <P>(2) Any property from which designation is withdrawn because of a procedural error in the designation process shall automatically be considered eligible for inclusion in the National Register as a National Historic Landmark without further action and will be published as such in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>

          <P>(g)(1) The National Park Service will provide written notice of the withdrawal of a National Historic Landmark designation and the status of the National Register listing, and a copy of the report on which those actions are based to (i) the owner(s); (ii) the appropriate State official; (iii) the chief elected local official; (iv) the Members of Congress who represent the district and State in which the landmark is located; and (v) if the landmark is located on an Indian reservation, the chief executive officer of the Indian tribe. In the case of a landmark with <PRTPAGE P="412"/>more than 50 owners, the general notice specified in § 65.5(d)(3) will be used.</P>

          <P>(2) Notice of withdrawal of designation and related National Register listing and determinations of eligibility will be published periodically in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

          <SECTNO>§ 65.10</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Appeals for designation.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Any applicant seeking to have a property designated a National Historic Landmark may appeal, stating the grounds for appeal, directly to the Director, National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240, under the following circumstances:</P>
          <P>Where the applicant—</P>
          <P>(1) Disagrees with the initial decision of NPS that the property is not likely to meet the criteria of the National Historic Landmarks Program and will not be submitted to the Advisory Board; or</P>
          <P>(2) Disagrees with the decision of the Secretary that the property does not meet the criteria of the National Historic Landmarks Program.</P>
          <P>(b) The Director will respond to the appellant within 60 days. After reviewing the appeal the Director may:</P>
          <P>(1) Deny the appeal;</P>
          <P>(2) Direct that a National Historic Landmark nomination be prepared and processed according to the regulations if this has not yet occurred; or</P>
          <P>(3) Resubmit the nomination to the Secretary for reconsideration and final decision.</P>
          <P>(c) Any person or organization which supports or opposes the consideration of a property for National Historic Landmark designation may submit an appeal to the Director, NPS, during the designation process either supporting or opposing the designation. Such appeals received by the Director before the study of the property or before its submission to the National Park System Advisory Board will be considered by the Director, the Advisory Board and the Secretary, as appropriate, in the designation process.</P>
          <P>(d) No person shall be considered to have exhausted administrative remedies with respect to failure to designate a property a National Historic Landmark until he or she has complied with the procedures set forth in this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program authority and function.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code designates the Secretary as the authority for the issuance of certifications of historic district statutes and of State and local historic districts, certifications of significance, and certifications of rehabilitation in connection with certain tax incentives involving historic preservation. These certification responsibilities have been delegated to the National Park Service (NPS); the following office issues those certifications: National Park Service, Washington Area Service Office, Technical Preservation Services, Heritage Preservation Services (WASO), 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240.<PRTPAGE P="413"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) NPS WASO establishes program direction and considers appeals of certification denials. It is the responsibility of owners wishing certifications to provide sufficient documentation to the Secretary to make certification decisions. These procedures, upon their effective date, are applicable to future and pending certification requests, except as otherwise provided herein.</P>
          <P>(c) States receiving Historic Preservation Fund grants from the Department participate in the review of requests for certification, through recommendations to the Secretary by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO). The SHPO acts on behalf of the State in this capacity and, therefore, the NPS is not responsible for any actions, errors or omissions of the SHPO.</P>
          <P>(1) Requests for certifications and approvals of proposed rehabilitation work are sent by an owner first to the appropriate SHPO for review. State comments are recorded on National Park Service Review Sheets (NPS Forms 10-168 (d) and (e)) and are carefully considered by the Secretary before a certification decision is made. Recommendations of States with approved State programs are generally followed, but by law, all certification decisions are made by the Secretary, based upon professional review of the application and related information. The decision of the Secretary may differ from the recommendation of the SHPO.</P>
          <P>(2) A State may choose not to participate in the review of certification requests. States not wishing to participate in the comment process should notify the Secretary in writing of this fact. Owners from such nonparticipating States may request certifications by sending their applications directly to the appropriate NPS WASO listed above. In all other situations, certification requests are sent first to the appropriate SHPO.</P>
          <P>(d) The Internal Revenue Service is responsible for all procedures, legal determinations, and rules and regulations concerning the tax consequences of the historic preservation provisions described in this part. Any certification made by the Secretary pursuant to this part shall not be considered as binding upon the Internal Revenue Service or the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to tax consequences under the Internal Revenue Code. For example, certifications made by the Secretary do not constitute determinations that a structure is of the type subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167 of the Code.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>As used in these regulations:</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Certified Historic Structure</E> means a building (and its structural components) which is of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which is either:</P>
          <P>(a) Individually listed in the National Register; or</P>
          <P>(b) Located in a registered historic district and certified by the Secretary as being of historic significance to the district.</P>

          <P>Portions of larger buildings, such as single condominium apartment units, are no independently considered certified historic structures. Rowhouses, even with abutting or party walls, are considered as separate buildings. For purposes of the certification decisions set forth in this part, a certified historic structure encompasses the historic building and its site, landscape features, and environment, generally referred to herein as a “property” as defined below. The NPS decision on listing a property in the National Register of Historic Places, including boundary determinations, does not limit the scope of review of the rehabilitation project for tax certification purposes. Such review will include the entire historic property as it existed prior to rehabilitation and any related new construction. For purposes of the charitable contribution provisions only, a certified historic structure need not be depreciable to qualify; may be a structure other than a building; and may also be a remnant of a building such as a facade, if that is all that remains. For purposes of the other rehabilitation tax credits under section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code, any property located in a registered historic district is considered a certified <PRTPAGE P="414"/>historic structure so that other rehabilitation tax credits are not available; exemption from this provision can generally occur only if the Secretary has determined, prior to the rehabilitation of the property, that it is not of historic significance to the district.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Introduction to certifications of significance and rehabilitation and information collection.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Who may apply:</P>

          <P>(1) Ordinarily, only the fee simple owner of the property in question may apply for the certifications described in §§ 67.4 and 67.6 hereof. If an application for an evaluation of significance or rehabilitation project is made by someone other than the fee simple owner, however, the application must be accompanied by a written statement from the fee simple owner indicating that he or she is aware of the application and has no objection to the request for certification.<PRTPAGE P="415"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) Upon request of a SHPO the Secretary may determine whether or not a particular property located within a registered historic district qualifies as a certified historic structure. The Secretary shall do so, however, only after notifying the fee simple owner of record of the request, informing such owner of the possible tax consequences of such a decision, and permitting the property owner a 30-day time period to submit written comments to the Secretary prior to decision. Such time period for comment may be waived by the fee simple owner.</P>
          <P>(3) The Secretary may undertake the certifications described in §§ 67.4 and 67.6 on his own initiative after notifying the fee simple owner and the SHPO and allowing a comment period as specified in § 67.3(a)(2).</P>
          <P>(4) Owners of properties which appear to meet National Register criteria but are yet listed in the National Register or which are located within potential historic districts may request preliminary determinations from the Secretary as to whether such properties may qualify as certified historic structures when and if the properties or the potential historic districts in which they are located are listed in the National Register. Preliminary determinations may also be requested for properties outside the period or area of significance of registered historic districts as specified in § 67.5(c). Procedures for obtaining these determinations shall be the same as those described in § 67.4. Such determinations are preliminary only and are not binding on the Secretary. Preliminary determinations of significance will become final as of the date of the listing of the individual property or district in the National Register. For properties outside the period or area of significance of a registered historic district, preliminary determinations of significance will become final, except as provided below, when the district documentation on file with the NPS is formally amended. If during review of a request for certification of rehabilitation, it is determined that the property does not contribute to the significance of the district because of changes which occurred after the preliminary determination of significance was made, certified historic structure designation will be denied.</P>
          <P>(5) Owners of properties not yet designated certified historic structures may obtain determinations from the Secretary on whether or not rehabilitation proposals meet the Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation. Such determinations will be made only when the owner has requested a preliminary determination of the significance of the property as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and such request for determination has been acted upon by the NPS. Final certifications of rehabilitation will be issued only to owners of certified historic structures. Procedures for obtaining these determinations shall be the same as those described in sec. 67.6.</P>
          <P>(b) How to apply:</P>

          <P>(1) Requests for certifications of historic significance and of rehabilitation shall be made on Historic Preservation Certification Applications (NPS Form No. 10-168). Normally, two copies of the application are required; one to be retained by the SHPO and the other to be forwarded to the NPS. The information collection requirements contained in the application and in this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 and assigned clearance number 1024-0009. Part 1 of the application shall be used in requesting a certification of historic significance or nonsignificance and preliminary determinations, while part 2 of the application shall be used in requesting an evaluation of a proposed rehabilitation project or, in conjunction with a Request for Certification of Completed Work, a certification of a completed rehabilitation project. Information contained in the application is required to obtain a benefit. Public reporting burden for this form is estimated to average 2.5 hours per response including the time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing and reviewing the form. Direct comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspect of this form may be made to the Chief, Administrative Services Division, National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013-7127 and to the Office of Management and Budget, <PRTPAGE P="416"/>Paperwork Reduction Project Number 1024-0009, Washington, DC 20503.</P>
          <P>(2) Application forms are available from NPS WASO or the SHPOs.</P>
          <P>(3) Requests for certifications, preliminary determinations, and approvals of proposed rehabilitation projects shall be sent to the SHPO in participating States. Requests in nonparticipating States shall be sent directly to the appropriate NPS WASO.</P>
          <P>(4) Generally reviews of certification requests are concluded within 60 days of receipt of a complete, adequately documented application, as defined § 67.4 and § 67.6 (30 days at the State level and 30 days at the Federal level). Where a State has chosen not to participate in the review process, review by the NPS generally is concluded within 60 days of receipt of a complete, adequately documented application. Where adequate documentation is not provided, the owner will be notified of the additional information needed to undertake or complete review. The time periods in this part are based on the receipt of a complete application; they will be adhered to as closely as possible and are defined as calendar days. They are not, however, considered to be mandatory, and the failure to complete review within the designated periods does not waive or alter any certification requirement.</P>
          <P>(5) Approval of applications and amendments to applications is conveyed only in writing by duly authorized officials of the NPS acting on behalf of the Secretary. Decisions with respect to certifications are made on the basis of the descriptions contained in the application form and other available information. In the event of any discrepancy between the application form and other, supplementary material submitted with it (such as architectural plans, drawings, specifications, etc.), the applicant shall be requested to resolve the discrepancy in writing. In the event the discrepancy is not resolved, the description in the application form shall take precedence. Falsification of factual representations in the application is subject to criminal sanctions of up to $10,000 in fines or imprisonment for up to five years pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001.</P>
          <P>(6) It is the owner's responsibility to notify the Secretary if application reviews are not completed within the time periods specified above. The Secretary in turn will consult with the appropriate office to ensure that the review is completed in as timely manner as possible in the circumstances.</P>
          <P>(7) Although certifications of significance and rehabilitation are discussed separately below, owners must submit part 1 of the Historic Preservation Certification Application prior to, or with, part 2. Part 2 of the application will not be processed until an adequately documented part 1 is on file and acted upon unless the property is already a certified historic structure. Reviews of rehabilitation projects will also not be undertaken if the owner has objected to the listing of the property in the National Register.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 67.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Certifications of historic significance.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Requests for certifications of historic significance should be made by the owner to determine—</P>
          <P>(1) That a property located within a registered historic district is of historic significance to such district; or</P>
          <P>(2) That a property located within a registered historic district is not of historic significance to such district; or</P>
          <P>(3) That a property not yet on the National Register appears to meet National Register criteria; or</P>
          <P>(4) That a property located within a potential historic district appears to contribute to the significance of such district.</P>

          <P>(b) To determine whether or not a property is individually listed or is part of a district in the National Register, the owner may consult the listing of National Register properties in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> (found in most large libraries), or contact the appropriate SHPO for current information.</P>

          <P>(c) If a property is located within the boundaries of a registered historic district and the owner wishes the Secretary to certify whether the property contributes or does not contribute to the historic significance of the district or if the owner is requesting a preliminary determination of significance in accordance with § 67.3(a)(4), the owner <PRTPAGE P="417"/>must complete part 1 of the Historic Preservation Certification Application according to instructions accompanying the application. Such documentation includes but is not limited to:</P>
          <P>(1) Name and mailing address of owner;</P>
          <P>(2) Name and address of property;</P>
          <P>(3) Name of historic district;</P>
          <P>(4) Current photographs of property; photographs of the building and its site and landscape features prior to alteration if rehabilitation has been completed; photograph(s) showing the property along with adjacent properties and structures on the street; and photographs of interior features and spaces adequate to document significance;</P>
          <P>(5) Brief description of appearance including alterations, distinctive features and spaces, and date(s) of construction;</P>
          <P>(6) Brief statement of significance summarizing how the property does or does not reflect the values that give the district its distinctive historical and visual character, and explaining any significance attached to the property itself (i.e., unusual building techniques, important event that took place there, etc.).</P>
          <P>(7) Sketch map clearly delineating property's location within the district; and</P>
          <P>(8) Signature of fee simple owner requesting or concurring in a request for evaluation.</P>
          <P>(d) If a property is individually listed in the National Register, it is generally considered a certified historic structure and no further certification is required. More specific considerations in this regard are as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) If the property is individually listed in the National Register and the owner believes it has lost the characteristics which caused it to be nominated and therefore wishes it delisted, the owner should refer to the delisting procedures outlined in 36 CFR part 60.</P>
          <P>(2) Some properties individually listed in the National Register include more than one building. In such cases, the owner must submit a single part 1 application, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, which includes descriptions of all the buildings within the listing. The Secretary will utilize the Standards for Evaluating Significance within Registered Historic Districts (§ 67.5) for the purpose of determining which of the buildings included within the listing are of historic significance to the property. The requirements of this paragraph are applicable to certification requests received by the SHPOs (and the NPS WASO in the case of nonparticipating States only) upon the effective date of these regulations.</P>
          <P>(e) Properties containing more than one building where the buildings are judged by the Secretary to have been functionally related historically to serve an overall purpose, such as a mill complex or a residence and carriage house, will be treated as a single certified historic structure, whether the property is individually listed in the National Register or is located within a registered historic district, when rehabilitated as part of an overall project. Buildings that are functionally related historically are those which have functioned together to serve an overall purpose during the property's period of significance. In the case of a property within a registered historic district which contains more than one building where the buildings are judged to be functionally related historically, an evaluation will be made to determine whether the component buildings contribute to the historic significance of the property and whether the property contributes to the significance of the historic district as in § 67.4(i). For questions concerning demolition of separate structures as part of an overall rehabilitation project, see § 67.6.</P>

          <P>(f) Applications for preliminary determinations for individual listing must show how the property individually meets the National Register Criteria for Evaluation. An application for a property located in a potential historic district must document how the district meets the criteria and how the property contributes to the significance of that district. An application for a preliminary determination for a property in a registered historic district which is outside the period or area of significance in the district documentation on file with the NPS must document and justify the expanded significance of the district and how the <PRTPAGE P="418"/>property contributes to the significance of the district or document the individual significance of the property. Applications must contain substantially the same level of documentation as National Register nominations, as specified in 36 CFR part 60 and National Register Bulletin 16, “Guidelines for Completing National Register of Historic Places Forms” (available from SHPOs and NPS WASO). Applications must also include written assurance from the SHPO that the district nomination is being revised to expand its significance or, for certified districts, written assurance from the duly authorized representative that the district documentation is being revised to expand its significance, or that the SHPO is planning to nominate the property or the district. Owners should understand that confirmation of intent to nominate by a SHPO does not constitute listing in the National Register, nor does it constitute a certification of significance as required by law for Federal tax incentives. Owners should further understand that they are proceeding at their own risk. If the property or district is not listed in the National Register for procedural, substantive or other reasons; if the district documentation is not formally amended; or if the significance of the property has been lost as a result of alterations or damage, these preliminary determinations of significance will not become final. The SHPO must nominate the property or the district or the SHPO for National Register districts and the duly authorized representative in the case of certified districts must submit documentation and have it approved by the NPS to amend the National Register nomination or certified district or the property or district must be listed before the preliminary certification of significance can become final.</P>
          <P>(g) For purposes of the other rehabilitation tax credits under section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code, properties within registered historic districts are presumed to contribute to the significance of such districts unless certified as nonsignificant by the Secretary. Owners of non-historic properties within registered historic districts, therefore, must obtain a certification of nonsignificance in order to qualify for those investment tax credits. If an owner begins or completes a substantial rehabilitation (as defined by the Internal Revenue Service) of a property in a registered historic district without knowledge of requirements for certification of nonsignificance, he or she may request certification that the property was not of historic significance to the district prior to substantial rehabilitation in the same manner as stated in paragraph (c) of this section. The owner should be aware, however, that the taxpayer must certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that, at the beginning of such substantial rehabilitation, he or she in good faith was not aware of the certification requirement by the Secretary of the Interior.</P>
          <P>(h) The Secretary discourages the moving of historic buildings from their original sites. However, if a building is to be moved as part of a rehabilitation for which certification is sought, the owner must follow different procedures depending on whether the building is individually listed in the National Register or is within a registered historic district. When a building is moved, every effort should be made to re-establish its historic orientation, immediate setting, and general environment. Moving a building may result in removal of the property from the National Register or, for buildings within a registered historic district, denial or revocation of a certification of significance; consequently, a moved building may, in certain circumstances, be ineligible for rehabilitation certification.</P>
          <P>(1) Documentation must be submitted that demonstrates:</P>
          <P>(i) The effect of the move on the building's integrity and appearance (any proposed demolition, proposed changes in foundations, etc.);</P>
          <P>(ii) Photographs of the site and general environment of the proposed site;</P>
          <P>(iii) Evidence that the proposed site does not possess historical significance that would be adversely affected by the moved building;</P>
          <P>(iv) The effect of the move on the distinctive historical and visual character of the district, where applicable; and</P>
          <P>(v) The method to be used for moving the building.<PRTPAGE P="419"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) For buildings individually listed in the National Register, the procedures contained in 36 CFR part 60 must be followed prior to the move, or the building will be removed from the National Register, will not be considered a certified historic structure, and will have to be renominated for listing. The owner may submit a part 1 application in order to receive a preliminary determination from the NPS of whether a move will cause the property to be removed from the National Register. However, preliminary approval of such a part 1 application does not satisfy the requirements of 36 CFR part 60. The SHPO must follow the remaining procedures in that regulation so that the NPS can determine that the moved building will remain listed in the National Register and retain its status as a certified historic structure.</P>
          <P>(3) If an owner moves (or proposes to move) a building into a registered historic district or moves (or proposes to move) a building elsewhere within a registered historic district, a part 1 application containing the required information described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section must be submitted. The building to be moved will be evaluated to determine if it contributes to the historic significance of the district both before and after the move as in § 67.4(i).</P>
          <P>(i) Properties within registered historic districts will be evaluated to determine if they contribute to the historic significance of the district by application of the Secretary's Standards for Evaluating Significance within Registered Historic Districts as set forth in § 67.5.</P>
          <P>(j) Once the significance of a property located within a registered historic district or a potential historic district has been determined by the Secretary, written notification will be sent to the owner and the SHPO in the form of a certification of significance or nonsignificance.</P>
          <P>(k) Owners shall report to the Secretary through the SHPO any substantial damage, alteration or changes to a property that occurs after issuance of a certification of significance and prior to a final certification of rehabilitation. The Secretary may withdraw a certification of significance, upon thirty days notice to the owner, if a property has been damaged, altered or changed effective as of the date of the occurrence. The property may also be removed from the National Register, in accordance with the procedures in 36 CFR part 60. A revocation of certification of significance pursuant to this part may be appealed under § 67.10. For damage, alteration or changes caused by unacceptable rehabilitation work, see § 67.6(f).</P>

          <SUBJECT>Standards for evaluating significance within registered historic districts.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Properties located within registered historic districts are reviewed by the Secretary to determine if they contribute to the historic significance of the district by applying the following Standards for Evaluating Significance within Registered Historic Districts.</P>
          <P>(1) A building contributing to the historic significance of a district is one which by location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association adds to the district's sense of time and place and historical development.</P>
          <P>(2) A building not contributing to the historic significance of a district is one which does not add to the district's sense of time and place and historical development; or one where the location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association have been so altered or have so deteriorated that the overall integrity of the building has been irretrievably lost.</P>
          <P>(3) Ordinarily buildings that have been built within the past 50 years shall not be considered to contribute to the significance of a district unless a strong justification concerning their historical or architectural merit is given or the historical attributes of the district are considered to be less than 50 years old.</P>

          <P>(b) A condemnation order may be presented as evidence of physical deterioration of a building but will not of itself be considered sufficient evidence to warrant certification of nonsignificance for loss of integrity. In certain cases it may be necessary for the owner <PRTPAGE P="420"/>to submit a structural engineer's report to help substantiate physical deterioration and/or structural damage. Guidance on preparing a structural engineer's report is available from the appropriate SHPO or NPS WASO.</P>
          <P>(c) Some properties listed in the National Register, primarily districts, are resources whose concentration or continuity possesses greater historical significance than many of their individual component buildings and structures. These usually are documented as a group rather than individually. Accordingly, this type of National Register documentation is not conclusive for the purposes of this part and must be supplemented with information on the significance of the specific property. Certifications of significance and nonsignificance will be made on the basis of the application documentation, existing National Register documentation, and other available information as needed. The Keeper may amend the National Register documentation by issuing a supplementary record if the application material warrants such an amendment. If a certification request is received for a property which is not yet listed on the National Register or which is outside a district's established period or area of significance, a preliminary determination of significance will be issued only if the request includes adequate documentation and if there is written assurance from the SHPO that the SHPO plans to nominate the property or district or that the district nomination in question is being revised to expand its significance or for certified districts, written assurance from the duly authorized representative that the district documentation is being revised to expand the significance. Certifications will become final when the property or district is listed or when the district documentation is officially amended unless the significance of the property has been lost as a result of alteration or damage. For procedures on amending listings to the National Register and additional information on the use of National Register documentation and the supplementary record which is contained in National Register Bulletin 19, “Policies and Procedures for Processing National Register Nominations,” consult the appropriate SHPO or NPS WASO.</P>
          <P>(d) Where rehabilitation credits are sought, certifications of significance will be made on the appearance and condition of the property before rehabilitation was begun.</P>
          <P>(e) If a nonhistoric surface material obscures a facade, it may be necessary for the owner to remove a portion of the surface material prior to requesting certification so that a determination of significance or nonsignificance can be made. After the material has been removed, if the obscured facade has retained substantial historic integrity and the property otherwise contributes to the historic district, it will be determined to be a certified historic structure. However, if the obscuring material remains when a determination of nonsignificance is requested under § 67.4(a)(2), the property will be presumed to contribute to the historic significance of the district, if otherwise qualified, and, therefore, not eligible for the other tax credits under section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code.</P>
          <P>(f) Additional guidance on certifications of historic significance is available from SHPOs and NPS WASO.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 67.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Certifications of rehabilitation.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Owners who want rehabilitation projects for certified historic structures to be certified by the Secretary as being consistent with the historic character of the structure, and, where applicable, the district in which the structure is located, thus qualifying as a certified rehabilitation, shall comply with the procedures listed below. A fee, as described in § 67.11, for reviewing all proposed, ongoing, or completed rehabilitation work is charged by the Secretary. No certification decisions will be issued on any application until the appropriate remittance is received.</P>

          <P>(1) To initiate review of a rehabilitation project for certification purposes, an owner must complete part 2 of the Historic Preservation Certification Application according to instructions accompanying the application. These instructions explain in detail the documentation required for certification of a rehabilitation project. The application may describe a proposed rehabilitation project, a project in progress, or <PRTPAGE P="421"/>a completed project. In all cases, documentation, including photographs adequate to document the appearance of the structure(s), both on the exterior and on the interior, and its site and environment prior to rehabilitation must accompany the application. The social security or taxpayer identification number(s) of all owners must be provided in the application. Other documentation, such as window surveys or cleaning specifications, may be required by reviewing officials to evaluate certain rehabilitation projects. Plans for any attached, adjacent, or related new construction must also accompany the application. Where necessary documentation is not provided, review and evaluation may not be completed and a denial of certification will be issued on the basis of lack of information. Owners are strongly encouraged to submit part 2 of the application prior to undertaking any rehabilitation work. Owners who undertake rehabilitation projects without prior approval from the Secretary do so strictly at their own risk. Because the circumstances of each rehabilitation project are unique to the particular certified historic structure involved, certifications that may have been granted to other rehabilitations are not specifically applicable and may not be relied on by owners as applicable to other projects.</P>
          <P>(2) A project does not become a certified rehabilitation until it is completed and so designated by the NPS. A determination that the completed rehabilitation of a property not yet designated a certified historic structure meets the Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation does not constitute a certification of rehabilitation. When requesting certification of a completed rehabilitation project, the owner shall submit a Request for Certification of Completed Work (NPS Form 10-168c) and provide the project completion date and a signed statement that the completed rehabilitation project meets the Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation and is consistent with the work described in part 2 of the Historic Preservation Certification Application. Also required in requesting certification of a completed rehabilitation project are costs attributed to the rehabilitation, photographs adequate to document the completed rehabilitation, and the social security or taxpayer identification number(s) of all owners.</P>
          <P>(b) A rehabilitation project for certification purposes encompasses all work on the interior and exterior of the certified historic structure(s) and its site and environment, as determined by the Secretary, as well as related demolition, new construction or rehabilitation work which may affect the historic qualities, integrity or site, landscape features, and environment of the certified historic structure(s). More specific considerations in this regard are as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) All elements of the rehabilitation project must meet the Secretary's ten Standards for Rehabilitation (§ 67.7); portions of the rehabilitation project not in conformance with the Standards may not be exempted. In general, an owner undertaking a rehabilitation project will not be held responsible for prior rehabilitation work not part of the current project, or rehabilitation work that was undertaken by previous owners or third parties.</P>

          <P>(2) However, if the Secretary considers or has reason to consider that a project submitted for certification does not include the entire rehabilitation project subject to review hereunder, the Secretary may choose to deny a rehabilitation certification or to withhold a decision on such a certification until such time as the Internal Revenue Service, through a private letter ruling, has determined, pursuant to these regulations and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and income tax regulations, the proper scope of the rehabilitation project to be reviewed by the Secretary. Factors to be taken into account by the Secretary and the Internal Revenue Service in this regard include, but are not limited to, the facts and circumstance of each application and (i) whether previous demolition, construction or rehabilitation work irrespective of ownership or control at the time was in fact undertaken as part of the rehabilitation project for which certification is sought, and (ii) whether property conveyances, reconfigurations, ostensible <PRTPAGE P="422"/>ownership transfers or other transactions were transactions which purportedly limit the scope of a rehabilitation project for the purpose of review by the Secretary without substantially altering beneficial ownership or control of the property. The fact that a property may still qualify as a certified historic structure after having undergone inappropriate rehabilitation, construction or demolition work does not preclude the Secretary or the Internal Revenue Service from determining that such inappropriate work is part of the rehabilitation project to be reviewed by the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(3) Conformance to the Standards will be determined on the basis of the application documentation and other available information by evaluating the property as it existed prior to the commencement of the rehabilitation project, regardless of when the property becomes or became a certified historic structure.</P>
          <P>(4) For rehabilitation projects involving more than one certified historic structure where the structures are judged by the Secretary to have been functionally related historically to serve an overall purpose, such as a mill complex or a residence and carriage house, rehabilitation certification will be issued on the merits of the overall project rather than for each structure or individual component. For rehabilitation projects where there is no historic functional relationship among the structures, the certification decision will be made for each separate certified historic structure regardless of how they are grouped for ownership or development purposes.</P>
          <P>(5) Demolition of a building as part of a rehabilitation project involving multiple buildings may result in denial of certification of the rehabilitation. In projects where there is no historic functional relationship among the structures being rehabilitated, related new construction which physically expands one certified historic structure undergoing rehabilitation and, therefore, directly causes the demolition of an adjacent structure will generally result in denial of certification of the rehabilitation unless a determination has been made that the building to be demolished is not a certified historic structure as in § 67.4(a). In rehabilitation projects where the structures have been determined to be functionally related historically, demolition of a component may be approved, in limited circumstances, when:</P>
          <P>(i) The component is outside the period of significance of the property, or</P>
          <P>(ii) The component is so deteriorated or altered that its integrity has been irretrievably lost; or</P>
          <P>(iii) The component is a secondary one that generally lacks historic, engineering, or architectural significance or does not occupy a major portion of the site and persuasive evidence is present to show that retention of the component is not technically or economically feasible.</P>
          <P>(6) In situations involving rehabilitation of a certified historic structure in a historic district, the Secretary will review the rehabilitation project first as it affects the certified historic structure and second as it affects the district and make a certification decision accordingly.</P>
          <P>(7) In the event that an owner of a portion of a certified historic structure requests certification for a rehabilitation project related only to that portion, but there is or was a larger related rehabilitation project(s) occurring with respect to the certified historic structure, the Secretary's decision on the requested certification will be based on review of the overall rehabilitation project(s) for the certified historic structure.</P>

          <P>(8) For rehabilitation projects which are to be completed in phases over the alternate 60-month period allowed in section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code, the initial part 2 application and supporting architectural plans and specifications should identify the project as a 60-month phased project and describe the number and order of the phases and the general scope of the overall rehabilitation project. If the initial part 2 application clearly identifies the project as a phased rehabilitation, the NPS will consider the project in all its phases as a single rehabilitation. If complete information on the rehabilitation work of the later phases is not described in the initial part 2 application, it may be submitted at a later date but must be clearly identified as a <PRTPAGE P="423"/>later phase of a 60-month phased project that was previously submitted for review. Owners are cautioned that work undertaken in a later phase of a 60-month phased project that does not meet the Standards for Rehabilitation, whether or not submitted for review, will result in a denial of certification of the entire rehabilitation with the tax consequences of such a denial to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Separate certifications for portions of phased rehabilitation projects will not be issued. Rather the owner will be directed to comply with Internal Revenue Service regulations governing late certifications contained in 26 CFR 1.48-12.</P>
          <P>(c) Upon receipt of the complete application describing the rehabilitation project, the Secretary shall determine if the project is consistent with the Standards for Rehabilitation. If the project does not meet the Standards for Rehabilitation, the owner shall be advised of that fact in writing and, where possible, will be advised of necessary revisions to meet such Standards. For additional procedures regarding rehabilitation projects determined not to meet the Standards for Rehabilitation, see § 67.6(f).</P>
          <P>(d) Once a proposed or ongoing project has been approved, substantive changes in the work as described in the application must be brought promptly to the attention of the Secretary by written statement through the SHPO to ensure continued conformance to the Standards; such changes should be made using a Historic Preservation Certification Application Continuation/Amendment Sheet (NPS Form 10-168b). The Secretary will notify the owner and the SHPO in writing whether the revised project continues to meet the Standards. Oral approvals of revisions are not authorized or valid.</P>
          <P>(e) Completed projects may be inspected by an authorized representative of the Secretary to determine if the work meets the Standards for Rehabilitation. The Secretary reserves the right to make inspections at any time up to five years after completion of the rehabilitation and to revoke a certification, after giving the owner 30 days to comment on the matter, if it is determined that the rehabilitation project was not undertaken as represented by the owner in his or her application and supporting documentation, or the owner, upon obtaining certification, undertook further unapproved project work inconsistent with the Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation. The tax consequences of a revocation of certification will be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.</P>
          <P>(f) If a proposed, ongoing, or completed rehabilitation project does not meet the Standards for Rehabilitation, an explanatory letter will be sent to the owner with a copy to the SHPO. A rehabilitated property not in conformance with the Standards for Rehabilitation and which is determined to have lost those qualities which caused it to be nominated to the National Register, will be removed from the National Register in accord with Department of the Interior regulations 36 CFR part 60. Similarly, if a property has lost those qualities which caused it to be designated a certified historic structure, it will be certified as noncontributing (see § 67.4 and § 67.5). In either case, the delisting or certification of nonsignificance is considered effective as of the date of issue and is not considered to be retroactive. In these situations, the Internal Revenue Service will be notified of the substantial alterations. The tax consequences of a denial of certification will be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 67.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Standards for rehabilitation.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The following Standards for Rehabilitation are the criteria used to determine if a rehabilitation project qualifies as a certified rehabilitation. The intent of the Standards is to assist the long-term preservation of a property's significance through the preservation of historic materials and features. The Standards pertain to historic buildings of all materials, construction types, sizes, and occupancy and encompass the exterior and the interior of historic buildings. The Standards also encompass related landscape features and the building's site and environment, as well as attached, adjacent, or related new construction. To be certified, a rehabilitation project must be determined by the Secretary <PRTPAGE P="424"/>to be consistent with the historic character of the structure(s) and, where applicable, the district in which it is located.</P>
          <P>(b) The following Standards are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility. (The application of these Standards to rehabilitation projects is to be the same as under the previous version so that a project previously acceptable would continue to be acceptable under these Standards.)</P>
          <P>(1) A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.</P>
          <P>(2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.</P>
          <P>(3) Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.</P>
          <P>(4) Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.</P>
          <P>(5) Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved.</P>
          <P>(6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.</P>
          <P>(7) Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.</P>
          <P>(8) Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.</P>
          <P>(9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.</P>
          <P>(10) New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.</P>

          <P>(c) The quality of materials and craftsmanship used in a rehabilitation project must be commensurate with the quality of materials and craftsmanship of the historic building in question. Certain treatments, if improperly applied, or certain materials by their physical properties, may cause or accelerate physical deterioration of historic buildings. Inappropriate physical treatments include, but are not limited to: improper repointing techniques; improper exterior masonry cleaning methods; or improper introduction of insulation where damage to historic fabric would result. In almost all situations, use of these materials and treatments will result in denial of certification. Similarly, exterior additions that duplicate the form, material, and detailing of the structure to the extent that they compromise the historic character of the structure will result in denial of certification. For further information on appropriate and inappropriate rehabilitation treatments, owners are to consult the Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings published by the NPS. “Preservation Briefs” and additional technical information to help property owners formulate plans for the rehabilitation, preservation, and continued use of historic properties consistent with the intent of the Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation are available from the SHPOs <PRTPAGE P="425"/>and NPS WASO. Owners are responsible for procuring this material as part of property planning for a certified rehabilitation.</P>
          <P>(d) In certain limited cases, it may be necessary to dismantle and rebuild portions of a certified historic structure to stabilize and repair weakened structural members and systems. In such cases, the Secretary will consider such extreme intervention as part of a certified rehabilitation if:</P>
          <P>(1) The necessity for dismantling is justified in supporting documentation;</P>
          <P>(2) Significant architectural features and overall design are retained; and</P>
          <P>(3) Adequate historic materials are retained to maintain the architectural and historic integrity of the overall structure.</P>

          <P>Section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 exempts certified historic structures from meeting the physical test for retention of external walls and internal structural framework specified therein for other rehabilitated buildings. Nevertheless, owners are cautioned that the Standards for Rehabilitation require retention of distinguishing historic materials of external and internal walls as well as structural systems. In limited instances, rehabilitations involving removal of existing external walls, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> external walls that detract from the historic character of the structure such as in the case of a nonsignificant later addition or walls that have lost their structural integrity due to deterioration, may be certified as meeting the Standards for Rehabilitation.</P>
          <P>(e) Prior approval of a project by Federal, State, and local agencies and organizations does not ensure certification by the Secretary for Federal tax purposes. The Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation take precedence over other regulations and codes in determining whether the rehabilitation project is consistent with the historic character of the property and, where applicable, the district in which it is located.</P>
          <P>(f) The qualities of a property and its environment which qualify it as a certified historic structure are determined taking into account all available information, including information derived from the physical and architectural attributes of the building; such determinations are not limited to information contained in National Register or related documentation.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 67.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Certifications of statutes.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) State or local statutes which will be certified by the Secretary. For the purpose of this regulation, a State or local statute is a law of the State or local government designating, or providing a method for the designation of, a historic district or districts. This includes any by-laws or ordinances that contain information necessary for the certification of the statute. A statute must contain criteria which will substantially achieve the purpose of preserving and rehabilitating properties of historic significance to the district. To be certified by the Secretary, the statute generally must provide for a duly designated review body, such as a review board or commission, with power to review proposed alterations to structures of historic significance within the boundaries of the district or districts designated under the statute except those owned by governmental entities which, by law, are not under the jurisdiction of the review body.</P>
          <P>(b) When the certification of State statutes will have an impact on districts in specific localities, the Secretary encourages State governments to notify and consult with appropriate local officials prior to submitting a request for certification of the statute.</P>

          <P>(c) State enabling legislation which authorizes local governments to designate, or provides local governments with a method to designate, a historic district or districts will not be certified unless accompanied by local statutes that implement the purposes of the State law. Adequate State statutes which designate specific historic districts and do not require specific implementing local statutes will be certified. If the State enabling legislation contains provisions which do not meet the intent of the law, local statutes designated under the authority of the enabling legislation will not be certified. When State enabling legislation exists, it must be certified before any local statutes enacted under its authority can be certified.<PRTPAGE P="426"/>
          </P>
          <P>(d) Who may apply. Requests for certification of State or local statutes may be made only by the Chief Elected Official of the government which enacted the statute or his or her authorized representative. The applicant shall certify in writing that he or she is authorized by the appropriate State or local governing body to apply for certification.</P>
          <P>(e) Statute certification process. Requests for certification of State or local statutes shall be made as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) The request shall be made in writing from the duly authorized representative certifying that he or she is authorized to apply for certification. The request should include the name or title of a person to contact for further information and his or her address and telephone number. The authorized representative is responsible for providing historic district documentation for review and certification prior to the first certification of significance in a district unless another responsible person is indicated including his or her address and telephone number. The request shall also include a copy of the statute(s) for which certification is requested, including any by-laws or ordinances that contain information necessary for the certification of the statute. Local governments shall also submit a copy of the State enabling legislation, if any, authorizing the designation of historic districts.</P>
          <P>(2) Requests shall be sent to the SHPO in participating States and directly to appropriate NPS WASO in nonparticipating States.</P>
          <P>(3) The Secretary shall review the statute(s) and assess whether the statute(s) and any by-laws or ordinances that contain information necessary for the certification of the statute contain criteria which will substantially achieve the purposes of preserving and rehabilitating properties of historic significance to the district(s) based upon the standards set out above in § 67.8(a). The SHPO shall be given a 30-day opportunity to comment upon the request. Comments received from the SHPO within this time period will be considered by the Secretary in the review process. If the statute(s) contain such provisions and if this and other provisions in the statute will substantially achieve the purpose of preserving and rehabilitating properties of historic significance to the district, the Secretary will certify the statute(s).</P>
          <P>(4) The Secretary generally provides written notification within 30 days of receipt by the NPS to the duly authorized representative and to the SHPO when certification of the statute is given or denied. If certification is denied, the notification will provide an explanation of the reason(s) for such denial.</P>
          <P>(f) Amendment or repeal of statute(s). State or local governments, as appropriate, must notify the Secretary in the event that certified statutes are repealed, whereupon the certification of the statute (and any districts designated thereunder) will be withdrawn by the Secretary. If a certified statute is amended, the duly authorized representative shall submit the amendment(s) to the Secretary, with a copy to the SHPO, for review in accordance with the procedures outlined above. Written notification of the Secretary's decision as to whether the amended statute continues to meet these criteria will be sent to the duly authorized representative and the SHPO within 60 days of receipt.</P>
          <P>(g) The Secretary may withdraw certification of a statute (and any districts designated thereunder) on his own initiative if it is repeal or amended to be inconsistent with certification requirements after providing the duly authorized representative and the SHPO 30 days in which to comment prior to the withdrawal of certification.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 67.9</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Certifications of State or local historic districts.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The particular State or local historic district must also be certified by the Secretary as substantially meeting National Register criteria, thereby qualifying it as a registered historic district, before the Secretary will process requests for certification of individual properties within a district or districts established under a certified statute.</P>

          <P>(b) The provision described herein will not apply to properties within a State or local district until the district has been certified, even if the statute <PRTPAGE P="427"/>creating the district has been certified by the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(c) The Secretary considers the duly authorized representative requesting certification of a statute to be the official responsible for submitting district documentation for certification. If another person is to assume responsibility for the district documentation, the letter requesting statute certification shall indicate that person's name, address, and telephone number. The Secretary considers the authorizing statement of the duly authorized representative to indicate that the jurisdiction involved wishes not only that the statute in question be certified but also wishes all historic districts designated by the statute to be certified unless otherwise indicated.</P>
          <P>(d) Requests shall be sent to the SHPO in participating States and directly to the appropriate NPS WASO in nonparticipating States. The SHPO shall be given a 30-day opportunity to comment upon an adequately documented request. Comments received from the SHPO within this time period will be considered by the Secretary in the review process. The guidelines in National Register Bulletin 16, “Guidelines for Completing National Register of Historic Places Forms,” provide information on how to document historic districts for the National Register. Each request should include the following documentation:</P>
          <P>(1) A description of the general physical or historical qualities which make this a district; and explanation for the choice of boundaries for the district; descriptions of typical architectural styles and types of buildings in the district.</P>
          <P>(2) A concise statement of why the district has significance, including an explanation of the areas and periods of significance, and why it meets National Register criteria for listing (see 36 CFR part 60); the relevant criteria should be identified (A, B, C, and D).</P>
          <P>(3) A definition of what types of properties contribute and do not contribute to the significance of the district as well as an estimate of the percentage of properties within the district that do not contribute to its significance.</P>
          <P>(4) A map showing all district properties with, if possible, identification of contributing and noncontributing properties; the map should clearly show the district's boundaries.</P>
          <P>(5) Photographs of typical areas in the district as well as major types of contributing and noncontributing properties; all photographs should be keyed to the map.</P>
          <P>(e) Districts designated by certified State or local statutes shall be evaluated using the National Register criteria (36 CFR part 60) within 30 days of the receipt of the required documentation by the Secretary. Written notification of the Secretary's decision will be sent to the duly authorized representative or to the person designated as responsible for the district documentation.</P>
          <P>(f) Certification of statutes and districts does not constitute certification of significance of individual properties within the district or of rehabilitation projects by the Secretary.</P>

          <P>(g) Districts certified by the Secretary as substantially meeting the requirements for listing will be determined eligible for listing in the National Register at the time of certification and will be published as such in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(h) Documentation on additional districts designated under a State or local statute the has been certified by the Secretary should be submitted to the Secretary for certification following the same procedures and including the same information outlined in the section above.</P>

          <P>(i) State or local governments, as appropriate, shall notify the Secretary if a certified district designation is amended (including boundary changes) or repealed. If a certified district designation is amended, the duly authorized representative shall submit documentation describing the change(s) and, if the district has been increased in size, information on the new areas as outlined in § 67.9. A revised statement of significance for the district as a whole shall also be included to reflect any changes in overall significance as a result of the addition or deletion of areas. Review procedures shall follow those outlined in § 67.9 (d) and (e). The Secretary will withdraw certification of repealed or inappropriately amended certified district designations, thereby <PRTPAGE P="428"/>disqualifying them as registered historic districts.</P>
          <P>(j) The Secretary may withdraw certification of a district on his own initiative if it ceases to meet the National Register Criteria for Evaluation after providing the duly authorized representative and the SHPO 30 days in which to comment prior to withdrawal of certification.</P>
          <P>(k) The Secretary urges State and local review boards of commissions to become familiar with the Standards used by the Secretary of the Interior for certifying the rehabilitation of historic properties and to consider their adoption for local design review.</P>

          <P>(1) Appeals must:</P>
          <P>(i) Be in writing; e.g. letter, fax, or e-mail;</P>
          <P>(ii) Be addressed to the Chief Appeals Officer, Cultural Resources, National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240;</P>
          <P>(iii) Be received by NPS within 30 days of receipt by the owner or a duly authorized representative of the decision which is the subject of the appeal; and</P>
          <P>(iv) Include all information the owner wishes the Chief Appeals Officer to consider in deciding the appeal.</P>
          <P>(2) The appellant may request a meeting to discuss the appeal.</P>
          <P>(3) NPS will notify the SHPO that an appeal is pending.</P>
          <P>(4) The Chief Appeals Officer will consider the record of the decision in question, any further written submissions by the owner, and other available information and will provide the appellant a written decision as promptly as circumstances permit.</P>
          <P>(5) Appeals under this section constitute an administrative review of the decision appealed from and are not conducted as an adjudicative proceeding.</P>
          <P>(b) The denial of a preliminary determination of significance for an individual property may not be appealed by the owner because the denial itself does not exhaust the administrative remedy that is available. The owner instead must seek recourse by undertaking the usual nomination process (36 CFR part 60).</P>
          <P>(c) In considering such appeals or administrative reviews, the Chief Appeals Officer shall take in account alleged errors in professional judgment or alleged prejudicial procedural errors by NPS officials. The Chief Appeals Officer's decision may:</P>
          <P>(1) Reverse the appealed decision;</P>
          <P>(2) Affirm the appealed decision;</P>
          <P>(3) Resubmit the matter to WASO for further consideration; or</P>
          <P>(4) Where appropriate, withhold a decision until issuance of a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to § 67.6(b)(2).</P>
          <FP>The Chief Appeals Officer may base his decision in whole or part on matters or factors not discussed in the decision appealed from. The Chief Appeals Officer is authorized to issue the certifications discussed in this part only if he considers that the requested certification meets the applicable statutory standard upon application of the Standards set forth herein or he considers that prejudicial procedural error by a Federal official legally compels issuance of the requested certification.</FP>
          <P>(d) The decision of the Chief Appeals Officer shall be the final administrative decision on the appeal. No person shall be considered to have exhausted his or her administrative remedies with respect to the certifications or decisions described in this part until the Chief Appeals Officer has issued a final administrative decision pursuant to this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The standards for the treatment of historic properties will be used by the National Park Service and State historic preservation officers and their staff members in planning, undertaking and supervising grant-assisted projects for preservation, rehabilitation, restoration and reconstruction. For the purposes of this part:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Preservation</E> means the act or process of applying measures necessary to sustain the existing form, integrity and materials of an historic property. Work, including preliminary measures to protect and stabilize the property, generally focuses upon the ongoing maintenance and repair of historic materials and features rather than extensive replacement and new construction. New exterior additions are not within the scope of this treatment; however, the limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a preservation project.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Rehabilitation</E> means the act or process of making possible an efficient compatible use for a property through repair, alterations and additions while preserving those portions or features that convey its historical, cultural or architectural values.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Restoration</E> means the act or process of accurately depicting the form, features and character of a property as it appeared at a particular period of time by means of the removal of features from other periods in its history and reconstruction of missing features from the restoration period. The limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a restoration project.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Reconstruction</E> means the act or process of depicting, by means of new construction, the form, features and detailing of a non-surviving site, landscape, building, structure or object for the purpose of replicating its appearance at a specific period of time and in its historic location.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 68.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Standards.</SUBJECT>
          <P>One set of standards—preservation, rehabilitation, restoration or reconstruction—will apply to a property undergoing treatment, depending upon the property's significance, existing physical condition, the extent of documentation available and interpretive goals, when applicable. The standards will be applied taking into consideration the economic and technical feasibility of each project.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Preservation.</E> (1) A property will be used as it was historically, or be given a new use that maximizes the retention of distinctive materials, features, spaces and spatial relationships. Where a treatment and use have not been identified, a property will be protected and, if necessary, stabilized until additional work may be undertaken.<PRTPAGE P="430"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The replacement of intact or repairable historic materials or alteration of features, spaces and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.</P>
          <P>(3) Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Work needed to stabilize, consolidate and conserve existing historic materials and features will be physically and visually compatible, identifiable upon close inspection and properly documented for future research.</P>
          <P>(4) Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved.</P>
          <P>(5) Distinctive materials, features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved.</P>
          <P>(6) The existing condition of historic features will be evaluated to determine the appropriate level of intervention needed. Where the severity of deterioration requires repair or limited replacement of a distinctive feature, the new material will match the old in composition, design, color and texture.</P>
          <P>(7) Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used.</P>
          <P>(8) Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Rehabilitation.</E> (1) A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces and spatial relationships.</P>
          <P>(2) The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.</P>
          <P>(3) Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, will not be undertaken.</P>
          <P>(4) Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved.</P>
          <P>(5) Distinctive materials, features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved.</P>
          <P>(6) Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.</P>
          <P>(7) Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used.</P>
          <P>(8) Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.</P>
          <P>(9) New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment.</P>
          <P>(10) New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Restoration.</E> (1) A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that interprets the property and its restoration period.</P>
          <P>(2) Materials and features from the restoration period will be retained and preserved. The removal of materials or alteration of features, spaces and spatial relationships that characterize the period will not be undertaken.</P>

          <P>(3) Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Work needed to stabilize, consolidate and conserve materials and features from the restoration period <PRTPAGE P="431"/>will be physically and visually compatible, identifiable upon close inspection and properly documented for future research.</P>
          <P>(4) Materials, features, spaces and finishes that characterize other historical periods will be documented prior to their alteration or removal.</P>
          <P>(5) Distinctive materials, features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize the restoration period will be preserved.</P>
          <P>(6) Deteriorated features from the restoration period will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture and, where possible, materials.</P>
          <P>(7) Replacement of missing features from the restoration period will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. A false sense of history will not be created by adding conjectural features, features from other properties, or by combining features that never existed together historically.</P>
          <P>(8) Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used.</P>
          <P>(9) Archeological resources affected by a project will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.</P>
          <P>(10) Designs that were never executed historically will not be constructed.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Reconstruction.</E> (1) Reconstruction will be used to depict vanished or non-surviving portions of a property when documentary and physical evidence is available to permit accurate reconstruction with minimal conjecture and such reconstruction is essential to the public understanding of the property.</P>
          <P>(2) Reconstruction of a landscape, building, structure or object in its historic location will be preceded by a thorough archeological investigation to identify and evaluate those features and artifacts that are essential to an accurate reconstruction. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.</P>
          <P>(3) Reconstruction will include measures to preserve any remaining historic materials, features, and spatial relationships.</P>
          <P>(4) Reconstruction will be based on the accurate duplication of historic features and elements substantiated by documentary or physical evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different features from other historic properties. A reconstructed property will re-create the appearance of the non-surviving historic property in materials, design, color and texture.</P>
          <P>(5) A reconstruction will be clearly identified as a contemporary re-creation.</P>
          <P>(6) Designs that were never executed historically will not be constructed.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Action plan.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The purpose of the Assessment is to provide background and justification for an Action Plan. The Action Plan, which is the essential core of the Action Program, must be a clear statement of the community's specific objectives, priorities and implementation strategies in relation to the intent of the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program and the local government's overall recreation system goals. The Action Plan should be carefully tailored to the comprehensive community goals and directly responsive to the needs and problems identified in § 72.12. Citizen involvement in the development of the Action Plan is required and may include surveys, hearings, meetings, and/or consultation as appropriate. This involvement is essential in the development of goals, objectives and the setting of project priorities.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Goals for the System.</E> This section should set forth the overall goals and specific objectives for the system. Goals will clearly relate to the needs and issues identified in the Assessment and must be projected for at least the five-year life of the Action Program. The goals should be consistent with and, where appropriate, included in the general planning goals of the local government. Where local governments have developed, adopted and are utilizing an overall park and recreation plan, the goals of that plan may be appropriate for this requirement. Goals should be the basis for priorities, schedules and implementation strategies stated in the plan.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Strategies to Address National and Local Concerns.</E> This section should include a description of local strategies for recreation system recovery. A “strategy” defines the total approach to remedying system deficiencies and provides a rationale for priorities reflected in implementation schedules. Strategies should be devised which address the following national concerns:</P>
            <P>(1) Ways in which park and recreation plans contribute to, and will be interrelated with, the local government's community development and urban revitalization efforts;</P>
            <P>(2) The degree to which park and recreation plans serve citizens who reside in economically-distressed areas of the community and will improve access to park and recreation facilities and programs for minority groups, low- and moderate-income populations, and the handicapped;</P>
            <P>(3) The extent to which the Action Program and its plan component will relate employment opportunities for minorities, youth and low- and moderate-income residents;</P>
            <P>(4) How the plan seeks to obtain the widest range of beneficial uses of the natural environment and enhances and protects the natural environment;</P>
            <P>(5) How park and recreation resources will be targeted in neighborhoods where other neighborhood revitalization efforts are occurring;</P>
            <P>(6) How the plan seeks to restore outstanding or unique structures, landscapes, or similar features in parks of historical or architectural significance;</P>
            <P>(7) Local commitments to innovative and cost-effective programs and projects on the neighborhood level which augment recovery of park and recreation systems;</P>
            <P>(8) How the plan will be intergrated with other Federally assisted projects to maximize recreation opportunities;</P>
            <P>(9) How the plan will convert for recreation use, derelict and other public lands not designated for recreation; and</P>
            <P>(10) Inducements to encourage the private sector to provide neighborhood park and recreation facilities and programs.</P>
            <P>(11) How the plan will seek to preserve, restore and develop waterfront areas for recreation and open space.</P>

            <FP>If any of the above concerns are not of significance within a locality preparing the Recovery Action Program due to lack of the physical attributes described in the above eleven (11) items, the Action Plan should indicate why <PRTPAGE P="447"/>such strategies are not appropriate. Most communities will also have their own special concerns and should develop strategies to address them. These should accompany the strategies discussed above and provide a focus for specific recommendations.</FP>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Recommendations.</E> Recommendations for improvement of the park and recreation system should be discussed. Each recommendation or group of recommendations should be accompanied by a discussion of the techniques the local government will use to implement the recommendations. Reference should be made to how the recommendations relate to deficiencies, needs, and opportunities identified in previous sections of the Action Program. A brief physical development plan for the entire park and recreation system should be included. This can be accomplished with a map which indicates where existing facilities and activities occur as well as where future developments are to occur. Particular reference shall be made to populations served and indicated deficiencies.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Program Priorities and Implementation Schedule.</E> A statement of system priorities and a schedule for implementation shall be included. These priorities, together with justifying objectives and strategies for implementation shall be presented. Priorities presented will be an important factor in the evaluation and approval of requests for UPARR funding. Active and continued citizen participation is necessary throughout the process. Specific projects to be undertaken and the programs to be improved, expanded, introduced, or eliminated through rehabilitation, physical, service, management, and coordination actions should be discussed. A clear assignment of agency responsibility and an estimate of the costs of implementation should accompany these priorities.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Evaluation and Updating of Action Program.</E> This section should outline a specific program for annual monitoring, evaluating, and updating of the complete Action Program, including both improvements needed in the Assessment and the Action Plan. Citizen involvement is essential in the evaluation and monitoring of the Action Program. Copies of approved Action Programs must be readily available to the public to insure adequate opportunities for citizen review and comment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preliminary Action Program—commitments to be included.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Local governments may submit a Preliminary Action Program during the initial interim period in lieu of a full Action Program. The Preliminary Action Program must include a firm commitment by the local government to complete and adopt a full Action Program by October 1, 1980. This commitment must include a schedule for the development of the full Recovery Action Program. The schedule should outline the activities which will be undertaken, the anticipated time frame for the development and completion of these activities, and the resources of people, money and support services necessary for the development and completion of the Recovery Action Program. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions concerning the use of the Preliminary Action Program, local governments are encouraged to prepare, adopt and submit as soon as possible a full Action Program which complies with the provisions of §§ 72.11, 72.12, and 72.13. Local governments which have already made a commitment to park and recreation systems by establishing ongoing planning, rehabilitation, service, operation and maintenance programs may use these as a starting point for meeting Action Program requirements.</P>

            <P>Applicants must have an approved Recovery Action Program on file with the appropriate NPS Regional Office prior to applying for Rehabilitation or Innovation grants. Rehabilitation and Innovation proposals must be based on priorities identified in the applicant jurisdiction's Recovery Action Program. Once NPS has indicated that a Rehabilitation or Innovation proposal is fundable, the applicant must meet all documentation requirements imposed by OMB Circulars A-102, A-95 and FMC 74-4. Regional offices of NPS will provide technical assistance to grantees in complying with these requirements.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Funding and matching share.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Recovery Action Program Grant Matching.</E> Up to 50 percent matching grants are authorized for the preparation of Recovery Action Programs (RAP). State, local and private in-kind donations of assistance (salaries, supplies, printing, etc.) for the preparation of a RAP may be used as all or part of the 50 percent local match. Such in-kind contributions for the UPARR Program may not be used as the matching share for other federally-assisted programs. In addition, Section 1009 of the Act provides that reasonable local costs of Recovery Action Program development may be used as part of a local match for Innovation or Rehabilitation grants only when the applicant has not received a Recovery Action Program grant. Reasonable costs means costs for supplies, salaries, etc., which are not excessive in relation to the normal market value within a geographic area. These costs must be well documented and included in the preapplication for the proposal in which they are to be used as a match. <PRTPAGE P="449"/>The match can only be used once, and allowed only after the RAP Has been approved by the respective NPS Regional Office.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Rehabilitation and Innovation grant matching.</E> The program provides for a 70 percent Federal match for rehabilitating existing recreation facilities and areas. Seventy percent matching funds are also authorized to local governments for innovation grants which will address systemwide coordination, management and community resource problems through innovative and cost-effective approaches.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Sources of Matching Share</E>—(1) <E T="03">State Incentive.</E> As an incentive for State involvement in the recovery or urban recreation systems, the Federal government will match, dollar for dollar, State contributions to the local share of an Innovation or Rehabilitation grant; up to 15 percent of the approved grant. The Federal share will not exceed 85 percent of the approved grant. The Director shall also encourage States and private interests to contribute to the non-Federal share of project costs. State and local government shares may be derived from any State or local government source of revenue.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Cash.</E> State, local and private funds may be used as the non-Federal share of project costs. In addition, two types of Federal funds may be used as part of a local match: General Revenue Sharing (Treasury Department) and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program funds (Department of Housing and Urban Development) [See also § 72.56(b)]. Section 1009 of the UPARR Act prohibits use of any other type of Federal grant to match UPARR grants.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Non-Cash</E>—(i) <E T="03">Material goods.</E> NPS encourages in-kind contributions including real property, buildings or building materials, and equipment to applicants by the State, other public agencies, private organizations or individuals. The value of the contributions may be used as all or part of the matching share of project costs, but must be appraised and approved by the Service prior to grant approval. Details regarding these types of donations are covered in OMB Circular A-102. In-kind contributions for the UPARR Program may not be used as the matching share for other Federally-assisted programs.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Services.</E> Any type of service or assistance which relates directly to a grant and the provision of a recreation opportunity, can be used as a matching share; e.g., technical and planning services, construction labor, playground supervision or management services.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Timing and duration of projects.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Construction components of projects must be initiated during the first full construction season following grant approval. The time for completing construction components of either Rehabilitation or Innovation proposals will be limited to three years or three construction seasons, whichever is greater, unless in the opinion of the Director an extension of time not to exceed a designated period will assure that completion of the grant objectives will be cost-effective within funding currently available, in accord with established goals of the UPARR Program, and of benefit to the federal government. Any component of an Innovation proposal which is to provide services or programs, must be started within one year from grant approval. The grant project term and expiration date for Rehabilitation and Innovation proposals will be established by NPS at the time of grant approval.</P>

            <P>(b) When an applicant wishes to complete a project in a number of stages, the applicant may request UPARR assistance for all the stages in a single application or proposal. In such cases, the three year limit on construction still applies. If an applicant wishes to request funding for only a single stage at time, each stage must be structured in such a manner that it will increase the recreation utility of the property, or provide direct recreation opportunities, independent of subsequent stages. Funding of one stage of a multi-staged proposal in no way implies that subsequent stages will also be funded.<PRTPAGE P="450"/>

            <SUBJECT>Land ownership, control and conversion.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Section 1010 of the Act provides that no property improved or developed with assistance through the program shall, without the approval of the Director, be converted to other than public recreation use. Therefore, any applicant or sub-grantee must demonstrate, at the time of grant approval, that it has adequate tenure and control of the land or facilities for which UPARR assistance is proposed, either through outright ownership or lease.</P>
            <P>(a) Lands or facilities that are not under adequate tenure or control will not be considered for UPARR assistance. If the land is not owned by the applicant or sub-grantee, then a non-revocable lease of at least 25 years, or a non-revocable lease providing ample time to amortize the total costs of the proposed activity, must be in effect at the time of grant approval. The lease cannot be revocable at will be the lessor. The costs of acquisition or leasing of land or facilities are not eligible for assistance under the provisions of the Act, section 1014.</P>
            <P>(b) The conversion or replacement of properties assisted through UPARR to non-recreation use must be in accord with the current local Recovery Action Program, and approved by the Director. Requests for permission to convert UPARR-assisted properties must be submitted to the Director in writing. The replacement property must assure the provision of adequate recreation properties and opportunities of reasonable equivalent location and recreation usefulness. For leased property which is developed or improved with UPARR funds, the grantee, as a condition of the receipt of these funds, must specify in a manner agreed to by the Director, in advance of the conversion, how the converted property will be replaced once the lease expires.</P>
            <P>(c) UPARR Program funds may be used to rehabilitate facilities built or develop with LWCF assistance only after a determination is made by NPS that the facility has been maintained in accordance with the LWCF Program.</P>
            <P>(d) Applicants must certify that any property acquired after January 2, 1971, and to be improved or enhanced by UPARR assistance, was acquired in conformance with Pub. L. 91-646, the Uniform Relocation and Land Acquisition Policies Act (See 41 CFR parts 114-50).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Pass-through funding.</SUBJECT>

            <P>Section 1006(a)(1) of the Act states that at the discretion of the applicant jurisdiction, and if consistent with an approved application, Rehabilitation and Innovation grants may be transferred in whole or in part to independent special purpose local governments, private non-profit agencies (including incorporated community or neighborhood groups) or city, county, or regional park authorities, provided that assisted recreation areas owned or managed by them offer recreation opportunities to the general public within the boundaries of the applicant's jurisdiction. No UPARR funds may be passed through for Recovery Action Program grants. The decision on whether or not to pass money through to non-profit organizations or governmental units is made by the applicant jurisdiction which is responsible for the grant; not NPS. Organizations, agencies or governmental units seeking funding assistance on a pass-through basis must work with an applicant jurisdiction in the preparation of the UPARR application, and the applicant jurisdiction will be responsible for the submission of the application. The applicant jurisdiction has full responsibility and liability for funds passed through to subgrantees. In the event of default by the pass-through recipient, the applicant jurisdiction must assume responsibility for ensuring that all provisions of the grant agreement are carried out, including the continued delivery of recreation services resulting from the grant. The pass-through of funds may constitute the entire grant <PRTPAGE P="451"/>proposal submitted by an applicant jurisdiction, or may be only a portion of it.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicant responsibilities.</E> The applicant jurisdiction possesses full responsibility and liability for funds passed-through to subgrantees. It should take precautions to ensure that pass-through agencies can reasonably be expected to comply with grant requirements.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Application requirements.</E> The applicant jurisdiction is responsible for actual preparation and submission of both the pre- and final grant applications. Organizations, agencies or governmental units seeking funding assistance on a pass-through basis must work with the applicant jurisdiction. The applicant jurisdiction may request any or all of the necessary documentation from the subgrantee. It is essential that applicants take precautions to pass-through grants only to reliable and capable agencies or organizations that can reasonably be expected to comply with grant and project requirements.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Recommended pass-through recipient standards.</E> Because the grantee has full responsibility for the pass-through grant, the grantee should ensure that subgrantees meet the following minimum standards.</P>
            <P>(i) Demonstrate a history of providing recreation services to the distressed community. The history of providing recreation services must be commensurate with the amount of UPARR assistance requested. A pass-through subgrantee may be a non-profit or neighborhood organization which has provided other social services to the community, or a newly formed, but reliable and capable group which can reasonably be expected to comply with grant and project requirements.</P>
            <P>(ii) Take responsibility for the same application, administration and compliance responsibilities as that of the applicant jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(iii) Certify that property improved or developed with UPARR funds will remain dedicated to public recreation use.</P>
            <P>(iv) Work through and with the applicant jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(v) Demonstrate that the existing, or soon to be developed, recreation property which it owns or operates is accessible to residents of targeted distressed areas.</P>
            <P>(vi) Demonstrate adequate tenure and control of the property to be rehabilitated or used for innovation, through lease or ownership.</P>
            <P>(vii) Establish a contractual agreement with the applicant juisdiction which is binding and enforceable to assure that the applicant jurisdiction can adequately meet its contractual obligations under the grant.</P>
            <P>(viii) Be empowered to contract or otherwise conduct the activities to be supported as a result of the grant.</P>
            <P>(ix) Not discriminate on the basis of residence except in reasonable fee differentials.</P>
            <P>(x) Be generally recognized as a provider of service to urban residents.</P>
            <P>(xi) Have adequate financial resources, the necessary experience, organization, technical qualifications and facilities; or a firm commitment, arrangement, or ability to obtain such.</P>
            <P>(xii) Have an adequate financial management system which provides efficient and effective accountability and control of all property, funds, and assets sufficient to meet grantee needs and grantee audit requirements.</P>
            <P>(xiii) Private non-profit agencies or corporations should also be properly incorporated as a non-profit organization with an elected and autonomous board which meets regularly.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Pass-through property and fee limitations.</E> Rehabilitation or Innovation assistance on property not in public ownership, operated by a private non-profit organization through a pass-through grant, will be limited to that portion of the property which directly provides recreation services. Such recreation services must be available to the public on a non-membership, non-fee, or reasonable fee basis, and during reasonable prime time. If a fee is charged or is required for the services resulting through the Rehabilitation or Innovation grant, the fee should be comparable to prevailing local rates for similar services. Charges for recreation services will only be permitted if they do not unfairly jeopardize participation in the recreation service by the disadvantaged population.</P>

            <P>(1) The general category of sites/facilities or programs involved must be an identified priority in the jurisdiction's Recovery Action Program.</P>
            <P>(2) The results of the expansion must not substantially increase the personnel or maintenance costs of the applicant jurisdiction's overall recreation system unless expansion of the system has been addressed as a priority in the jurisdiction's Recovery Action Program, and the RAP strategies specifying how the funds for increased personnel or maintenance costs associated with the expansion will be obtained. The preapplication narrative must describe the extent of increased personnel and maintenance for the project(s) included in the proposal, if any, and methods of financing them.</P>
            <P>(3) The expansion must increase the extent, volume, scope, or quality of recreation opportunities to residents of distressed neighborhoods.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">New development.</E> For purposes of this program, new development is defined as the developing for changing of relatively unimproved property which has not previously been developed for recreation. This includes the creation of new parks and facilities.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Rehabilitation.</E> New development will not be assisted under a rehabilitation grant.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Innovation.</E> New development may be allowed under an Innovation grant when it is directly related to a specific innovative idea or technique, increases the utility of a property and/or service program, and increases recreation opportunities for users in the target area.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fundable elements: Recovery Action Program grants.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Reasonable and documented costs necessary for preparing a Recovery Action Program may be reimbursed by UPARR funds from a 50 percent matching grant. These costs may include expenses for professional services; local public meetings; data collection and analysis; preparation, editing and printing of appropriate reports, plans, maps, charts and other documents forming a part of the plan; and supporting costs, supplies and other approved costs. Costs incurred prior to the approval of a Recovery Action Program grant will not be eligible for reimbursement or cost sharing.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 72.44</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Fundable elements: Rehabilitation and Innovation grant common elements.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) All Rehabilitation and Innovation proposals must be based on priorities identified in the applicant jurisdiction's local Recovery Action Program. An applicant may apply for UPARR assistance only in an amount which, together with other available public and private resources, is adequate to complete the work approved by the grant agreement. The applicant must document the availability and source of these resources at the time of preapplication for UPARR assistance. <PRTPAGE P="453"/>Fundable elements in both Rehabilitation and Innovation proposals may include: materials and labor, site planning, architectural and engineering fees, and other costs for activities necessary to complete the approved project. Reasonable architectural and engineering fees essential to the preparation of a proposal application, incurred within a period 9 months prior to preapplication submission to NPS, are reimbursable. Architectural and engineering fees prior to the 9 month period will not be eligible for reimbursement or cost sharing. Other costs incurred prior to approval of any UPARR grant, and fees to consultants for preparation of UPARR grant applications are not reimbursable. No more than 5 percent of the total grant cost may be used by the grantee or pass-through sub-grantee for grant administrative costs. The remaining funds must be made available for projects. Any costs incurred for travel outside the local applicant jurisdiction will not be reimbursable without prior approval from NPS.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Local intent.</E> Rehabilitation and Innovation proposals which provide recreation to residents within a distressed local neighborhood area will be given higher priority. Proposals which have a primary intent to attract or to provide recreation for visitors from outside the applicant jurisdiction, or proposals whose primary objective is the enhancement of the area's economy through the attraction of visitors to the jurisdiction, will not be considered. Innovation proposals which transport residents from distressed neighborhoods to recreation opportunities outside the local jurisdiction, may be considered eligible for funding.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Conservation and energy.</E> Proposals which foster the conservation of energy and natural resources are encouraged; e.g. improvements in accessibility which reduce the need of automobile transportation, efficient use of electrical or other power sources, and water conservation.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Multiple site requests.</E> Rehabilitation and Innovation proposals may request funding for neighborhood-oriented recreation facilities or services which affect the entire recreation system of the applicant jurisdiction, several specific sites or areas, or a single site or area. Innovation proposals which affect multiple facilities or services must be oriented to a single purpose, or one basic innovative category or approach.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Support facilities.</E> The rehabilitation of support facilities for any grant project will be eligible for funding only when such facilities are well defined, are included as part of an overall rehabilitation effort, and provide direct recreation opportunities and benefits to the population being served. Rehabilitation grants may cover costs of remodeling, expanding or developing (see § 72.42) existing outdoor or indoor recreation areas and facilities, including improvements in park landscapes and buildings. Assistance for the rehabilitation of multi-service facilities must be prorated to those elements within the proposal necessary for the provision of recreation opportunities.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Elements excluded from funding.</E> The Act excludes UPARR assistance for major sport arenas, exhibition areas and conference halls used primarily for commercial sports, spectator, or display activities; routine maintenance and upkeep supplies or activities; and for the acquisition of land or interests in land.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 72.45</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Fundable elements: Innovation grants.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Innovation grants may cover costs related to improved delivery of recreation services (including personnel, training, facilities, recreation equipment and supplies), except those which pertain to routine operation and maintenance not directly related to the provision of recreation opportunities. All equipment and supply requests in Innovation proposals will be reviewed to assure that they will substantially contribute to the recreation services intended under the specific grant. The intent of Innovation grants is to test new ideas, concepts and approaches aimed at improving facility design, operations or programming in the delivery of neighborhood recreation services. They should also contribute to a systems approach to recreation by linking recreation services with other critical community programs; such as transportation, housing, <PRTPAGE P="454"/>and health programs. The UPARR Program will competitively choose the best quality Innovation proposals with nationwide demonstration potential, and which serve people who most need the new recreation services. An innovative community recreation project may be a service, a process, an organizational arrangement or a technique. The innovation should demonstrate a concept that is untried, unique, and/or advances the state of the art for recreation. Ideas from successful Innovation proposals will be disseminated nationwide through annual progress reports to Congress, as required in section 1015(b) of the Act, and through the ongoing technical assistance efforts of NPS. Information seminars, workshops and other techniques may also be used to provide the greatest possible exposure of these ideas for use in other communities. Because the legislation limits the yearly funds available for Innovation grants (not more than 10% of funds authorized), the majority of Innovation grants should ideally be monetarily smaller awards aimed at leveraging public and private community support and providing activities with high demonstration value, rather than large-scale development or expansion projects. The long-range intent of funding innovative proposals is to support and demonstrate a great variety of ideas during the five year implementation of the UPARR Program. For this reason, only one or two proposals having a similar emphasis or approach will be funded. Proposed Innovation projects which have been demonstrated before or are currently being operated in other cities, may be considered for UPARR assistance if the application identifies and addresses the question of the special nature or circumstances surrounding the new project.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Program services.</E> Innovation grant costs may include those costs which relate to: demonstrations of the improved multiple-use of public buildings e.g., schools, community centers, libraries; unique program expansions or increases in services; purchase of recreation services on a contractual basis; increased access to recreation areas; and cost-effective management techniques.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Adaptive reuse.</E> In addition to providing services for areas or facilities already in recreation use, Innovation grants may provide funding for the adaptive reuse of areas or facilities not currently in recreation use, or those where mixed community use occurs. Physical rehabilitation of facilities not currently in recreation use (whether public or private) may be funded as part of an Innovation proposal, and would be classified as adaptive reuse. An example would be conversion of an abandoned building to a unique community recreation center. When only a portion of the area or facility will be used for recreation, only that portion will be eligible for UPARR funding.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Supplies.</E> Funds may be used to purchase expendable supplies and equipment which relate directly to an Innovation proposal, such as sports equipment, arts and crafts supplies, chairs and tables if needed for an activity, and essential emergency or safety equipment. General office supplies and furniture not used exclusively to provide recreation services as a part of the proposal, or not an inherent component of the proposal, will not be reimbursable.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Coordination.</E> Local costs incurred for coordinating any grant proposal activities and programs with other public, non-profit or private community services may be reimbursable.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Personnel.</E> Eligible personnel costs for Innovation proposals will be limited to salaries and benefits of those employees directly engaged in the provision of recreation services or formulation of new techniques. Volunteer services may be furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor. Each hour of committed volunteer service may be counted toward the local matching share of funds, if the service provided is an integral part of an approved proposal.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Special populations.</E> A proposal which will provide recreation opportunities primarily for a specific demographic group, such as the elderly, youth or handicapped, may be funded. However, the recreation provided must be open to the public, incorporate some activities for the general population, and address needs as identified in the <PRTPAGE P="455"/>local Recovery Action Program. Services for special populations, such as transportation to recreation facilities, may also be funded.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Basic types of Innovation proposals.</E> Types of Innovation proposals which can be funded are suggested by, but not limited to, the following types:</P>
            <P>(1) The unique integration of recreation with other community services; such as transportation, public housing and public safety; either to expand or update current services, or to link programs within the social service structure of a neighborhood, or between neighborhoods.</P>
            <P>(2) New management and cost-saving or service-efficient approaches for improving the delivery of recreation services should be fundamental to all Innovation and Rehabilitation proposals, and may also be the prime focus of an Innovation proposal. Extending hours of operation, increasing the variety of recreation programs, contracting with commercial or private non-profit agencies to supply specific recreation services, or assisting citizens in designing and operating their own programs, are examples of management approaches.</P>
            <P>(3) New approaches to facility design which emphasize user needs and preferences and promote efficient operation and energy conservation.</P>
            <P>(4) New fiscal techniques to generate revenue for continuing operation and maintenance, such as tax credits.</P>
            <P>(5) Techniques for improving transportation and access to recreation opportunities.</P>
            <P>(6) Techniques to facilitate private, non-profit, and community involvement in providing recreation opportunities.</P>
            <P>(7) Improved use of land resources; such as utilizing abandoned railroads and highway rights-of-way, waterfronts, street spaces, or derelict land for recreation.</P>
            <P>(8) Adaptive reuse or multiple use of public or private facilities and areas. (Private areas or facilities utilized must be opened to the public.)</P>
            <P>(9) Techniques to prevent or reduce crime, abuse and vandalism; such as better design, non-destructible building materials, or use of community volunteers to supervise areas.</P>
            <P>(10) Communications and public awareness of recreation opportunities, including education in leisure services; but excluding research.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Rehabilitation and Innovation grant.</E> The applicant shall provide citizens with an adequate opportunity to participate in the development of a Rehabilitation and/or Innovation proposal and in implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the activities supported through the grants. The applicant shall also encourage the submission of views and proposals, particularly by residents of blighted neighborhoods and citizens with low and moderate incomes. The applicant is encouraged to utilize a variety of approaches to ensure public involvement. Nothing in these requirements, however, shall be construed to restrict the legal responsibility and authority of the applicant for the execution of its Recovery Action Program, and the development of its UPARR applications.</P>

            <P>(1) Degree of need for funds to develop a Recovery Action Program and an ongoing planning process, including the size and complexity of the community's problems, deficiencies in existing planning, and in the capability of the community to initiate and sustain continuing planning efforts.</P>
            <P>(2) Degree of the community's commitment to systematic planning, including financial, personnel and time resources already devoted to planning or committed for the future.</P>
            <P>(3) Extent to which current park and recreation planning is integrated with overall community planning or would be better integrated as a result of the grant, including use of other Federal or State funds for related planning purposes.</P>
            <P>(4) Appropriateness and efficiency of the planning program's work elements (scope, timing, methodology, staffing and costs) in relation to the basic requirements for Recovery Action Programs contained in subpart B, §§ 72.10 through 72.18 (45 FR 15456).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Rehabilitation Grant Selection Criteria.</E> The following criteria will be used to evaluate and rank Rehabilitation proposals:</P>
            <P>(1) The Federal UPARR investment per person served by the entire system; relationship between the size of the community and the amount of grant funds requested. Highest priority will be given to proposals with lower per capita costs in relation to recreation benefits provided.</P>
            <P>(2) Providing neighborhood recreation needs. Higher priority will be given to proposals serving close-to-home recreation needs, lower priority to those serving area or jurisdiction-wide needs.</P>
            <P>(3) Condition of existing recreation properties to be rehabilitated, including the urgency of rehabilitation and the need to maintain existing services.</P>
            <P>(4) Improvement in the quality and quantity of recreation services as a result of rehabilitation, including improvements at specific sites and overall enhancement of the recreation system.</P>
            <P>(5) Improvement of recreation service to minority and low to moderate income residents, special populations, and distressed neighborhoods.</P>
            <P>(6) Proposal's consistency with local government objectives and priorities for overall community revitalization.</P>
            <P>(7) Neighborhood employment opportunities created.</P>
            <P>(8) State participation in the proposal, including financial and technical assistance.</P>
            <P>(9) Private participation by both the non-profit and for-profit sectors in the proposal, including contributions of financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(10) Jurisdiction's commitment to implementing its overall Recovery Action Program.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Innovation Grant Selection Criteria.</E> The following criteria will be used to evaluate and rank Innovation proposals:</P>
            <P>(1) Degree to which the proposal provides a new, unique or more effective means of delivering a recreation service that can serve as a model for other communities.</P>
            <P>(2) Degree of citizen involvement in proposal conceptualization and implementation.</P>
            <P>(3) Degree to which the proposal may lead to a positive, systemic change in how park and recreation services are provided. Extent to which the proposal creates opportunities for new partnerships between the people affected, private interests within the community, and public agencies (e.g., Mayor's Office, Recreation Department, Board of Education, Planning Department, social service agencies).</P>
            <P>(4) Degree of commitment of community and proposal participants to continue the long term program objectives, including commitments to continue funding after the requested Federal grant money is no longer available. Extent of private resources committed to providing funds or in-kind services for continuing operation and maintenance of projects.</P>

            <P>(5) Degree to which proposal managers use the Federal funds to leverage <PRTPAGE P="457"/>greater public or private investments (in the form of services and materials, as well as dollars).</P>
            <P>(6) Degree to which the proposal provides potential coordination with other community, State and Federal programs of community development and those providing recreation to the target population (e.g., public and private non-profit, education programs, CETA for employment, HUD programs).</P>
            <P>(7) Extent of improvement in the quality and quantity of recreation services as a result of the Innovation project.</P>
            <P>(8) Degree to which the proposal ties in with goals, priorities and implementation strategies expressed in the local park and recreation Recovery Action Program.</P>
            <P>(9) Degree to which the proposal leads to a transfer of a recreation role traditionally performed by a public entity, to quasi-public or private non-profit interests. This degree means the degree to which the private sector can take full responsibility, supplement, or fill the gaps in public recreation services, management or operation; either through a transfer of funding responsibility, or an exchange of technique or method approaches which may prove to be more effective under the private sector. This should in no way alter the public sector responsibility to continue to provide and/or monitor good quality recreation facilities and services.</P>
            <P>(10) Degree to which a proposal benefits disadvantaged community populations and/or those areas within a distressed community which have the greatest recreation deficiencies.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Innovation proposals for the adaptive reuse of non-recreation areas or structures, through rehabilitation for recreation should also address rehabilitation selection criteria, particularly the criteria covering Federal investment per person served and the degree to which the proposal would serve close to home recreation needs.</P>

            <P>The application procedure for Recovery Action Program grants differs from the procedure for Rehabilitation and Innovation grants. Ranking and selection for funding of Recovery Action Program grants will be initiated on the basis of a full application, preparation of which will be assisted through meetings with NPS regional staff.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Preapplication Conference.</E> In the preparation of a Recovery Action Program grant application, applicants are encouraged to discuss with NPS regional personnel, or State personnel, when an agreement between NPS and the State covers such action, the adequacy of the proposal in meeting the requirements for a Recovery Action Program. Prior to formal submission, the Recovery Action Program grant application should be reviewed with the appropriate NPS Regional Office.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission of Applications.</E> In addition to Standard Form 424 on Federal Assistance notification, applicants for Recovery Action Program grants shall submit the following documents and required attachments to NPS Regional Offices:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preapplication process for Rehabilitation and Innovation grants.</SUBJECT>
            <P>To reduce the amount of time and documentation needed for a full application, and to foster the competitive aspects of the UPARR program, a preapplication procedure is used.</P>
            <P>(a) The preapplication must provide information adequate to guide proposal selection. Grants will be awarded in accordance with the availability of funds. Funding for an approved grant will not be increased from subsequent yearly appropriations.</P>
            <P>(b) Applicants are encouraged to discuss their proposals with their NPS Regional Office to determine basic fundability and competitiveness prior to submitting a preapplication.</P>
            <P>(c) If a State is assisting the applicant in preapplication preparation, providing a source of matching share, or giving technical assistance, the State may assist in submission of the preapplication to the appropriate NPS Regional Office with the applicant's prior approval. The amount, source and assurance of State assistance for a matching share must be specified in the preapplication.</P>
            <P>(d) The following procedural guidelines shall apply to submission and approval of Rehabilitation and Innovation proposals.</P>

            <P>(1) Preapplications shall be submitted to the appropriate NPS Regional Office by the chief executive officer of the applicant jurisdiction. The preapplication must include those items as set forth in the <E T="03">Preapplication Handbook,</E> available from any NPS Regional Office. In addition to the narrative on selection criteria, all preapplications for Rehabilitation proposals must include a short description stating; (i) the problem addressed by the proposal, including existing conditions, (ii) the reason for the problem or why the condition exists, and (iii) the proposed solution to the problem and what corrective measures will be used.</P>
            <P>(2) An applicant may have no more than one Innovation and one Rehabilitation proposal under consideration in any one funding cycle.</P>
            <P>(3) Any existing and/or proposed fees or charges for recreation opportunities or services provided through a UPARR grant, whether for public, private or non-profit activities, must be identified in the preapplication.</P>
            <P>(4) Discretionary applicants must submit a narrative statement, signed by the chief executive of the applicant jurisdiction, which explains and quantifies the degree of physical and economic distress in the community. Statistics and discussion on distress shall address, but need not be limited to, the criteria used to select eligible jurisdictions contained in Appendix A of this part. A discretionary narrative statement must be included in each preapplication.</P>

            <P>(5) All submitted grant preapplications will be reviewed by NPS Regional Offices to assure that they meet all minimum legal and technical standards before being certified as eligible for competition. Proposals not meeting minimum standards will <PRTPAGE P="459"/>be returned to the applicant. Periodically, all certified proposals will be evaluated in the Regional Offices before being submitted to Washington, where they will be judged by national panels whose member are knowledgeable in recreation and urban revitalization. Innovation and Rehabilitation proposals will be judged by separate panels.</P>
            <P>(6) Following review and ranking by the panels, the Director will approve tentative grant offers for those proposals which may be funded. Successful applicants will be notified by the NPS Regional Offices, and completion of the formal application process will take place. The formal application process must be completed within 120 days of notification of the tentative grant offer, or the tentative grant offer may be withdrawn. Final approval of a grant and obligation of funds will occur when all application requirements have been met and the appropriate documents are on file. No costs may be incurred or reimbursed, except incurred architectural and engineering fees indicated in § 72.44, until NPS approval of the grant agreement.</P>
            <P>(7) Unfunded proposals may require modifications to improve their competitiveness. Applicants with such proposals will be advised by NPS of suggested modifications, if any, to increase their chances for funding in future grant rounds.</P>
            <P>(8) If an applicant wishes a proposal to remain in competition, it may be considered for two additional funding cycles, with or without minor modifications, before it is returned to the applicant. Major modifications of scope and/or total funding request will require complete resubmission of a proposal as a new preapplication. Applicants who wish to change the scope and/or total funds requested for a proposal which is already in competition, must submit a written request for withdrawal of the previous proposal before submitting a new proposal in the same competition.</P>
            <P>(9) The Director reserves the right to withdraw a grant offer if it is determined that any preapplication contains misstatements or misrepresentations of fact, or problems identified which cannot be resolved.</P>

The information is being collected to determine whether to approve a grant recipient's request to convert an assisted site or facility to other than public recreation uses.

Response is required in order to obtain the benefit of Department of the Interior approval.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 72.72</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Conversion requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Background and legal requirements.</E> The UPARR program has made funds available for the renovation and rehabilitation of numerous urban parks and recreation facilities. In many cases, the UPARR funds were used only in a portion of a site or facility or were only a small percentage of the funds required to renovate or rehabilitate a property. Nevertheless, all recipients of funds for renovation and rehabilitation projects are obligated by the terms of the grant agreement to continually maintain the site or facility for public recreation use regardless of the percent of UPARR funds expended relative to the project and the facility as a whole. This provision is contained in the UPARR Program Administration Guideline (NPS-37) and is also referenced in § 72.36. In accordance with section 1010 of the UPARR Act, no property improved or developed with UPARR assistance shall, without the approval of NPS, be converted to other than public recreation uses. A conversion will only be approved if it is found to be in accord with the current local park and recreation Recovery Action Program and/or equivalent recreation plans and only upon such conditions as deemed necessary to assure the provision of adequate recreation properties and opportunities of reasonably equivalent location and usefulness. Section 1010 is designed to ensure that areas or facilities receiving UPARR grant assistance are continually maintained in recreation use and available to the general public.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Prerequisites for conversion approval.</E> Requests for permission to convert UPARR assisted properties in whole or in part to other than public recreation uses must be submitted by the recipient to the appropriate NPS Regional Director in writing. NPS will only consider conversion requests if the following prerequisites have been met:</P>
            <P>(1) All practical alternatives to the proposed conversion have been evaluated.</P>
            <P>(2) The proposed conversion and substitution are in accord with the current Recovery Action Program and/or equivalent recreation plans.</P>

            <P>(3) The proposal assures the provision of adequate recreation properties and opportunities of reasonably equivalent usefulness and location. Dependent upon the situation and at the discretion of NPS, the replacement property need not provide identical recreation experiences or be located at the same <PRTPAGE P="462"/>site, provided it is in a reasonably equivalent location. It must, however, be administered by the same political jurisdiction as the converted property. Equivalent usefulness and location will be determined based on the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(i) Property to be converted must be evaluated in order to determine what recreation needs are being fulfilled by the facilities which exist and the types of recreation resources and opportunities available. The property being proposed for substitution must then be evaluated in a similar manner to determine if it will meet recreation needs which are at least like in magnitude and impact to the user community as the converted site.</P>
            <P>(ii) Replacement property need not necessarily be directly adjacent to or close by the converted site. This policy provides the administrative flexibility to determine location recognizing that the property should meet existing public recreation needs. While generally this will involve the selection of a site serving the same community(ies) or area as the converted site, there may be exceptions. For example, if property being converted is in an area undergoing major demographic change and the area has no existing or anticipated future need for recreation facilities, then the project sponsor should seek to locate the substitute area in another location within the jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(4) In the case of assisted sites which are partially rather than wholly converted, the impact of the converted portion on the remainder shall be considered. If such a conversion is approved, the unconverted area must remain recreationally viable or be replaced as well.</P>
            <P>(5) The guidelines for environmental evaluation have been satisfactorily completed and considered by NPS during its review of the proposed 1010 action. In cases where the proposed conversion arises from another Federal action, final review of the proposal shall not occur until NPS is assured that all environmental review requirements related to that other action have been met.</P>
            <P>(6) State intergovernmental clearinghouse review procedures have been adhered to if the proposed conversion and substitution constitute significant changes to the original grant.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendments for conversion.</E> All conversions require amendments to the original grant agreement. Amendment requests should be submitted concurrently with conversion requests or at such time as all details of the conversion have been worked out with NPS. Section 1010 project boundary maps shall be submitted with the amendment request to identify the changes to the original area caused by the proposed conversion and to establish a new project area pursuant to the substitution. Once the conversion has been approved, replacement property should be immediately acquired. Exceptions to this rule would occur only when it is not possible for replacement property to be identified prior to the request for the conversion. It will, however, be NPS policy to avoid such a situation if at all possible and to agree only if warranted by exceptional circumstances. In such cases, express commitment to satisfy section 1010 substitution requirements within a specified period, normally not to exceed one year following conversion approval, must be received from the local government agency in the form of a grant amendment.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Obsolete facilities.</E> Recipients are not required to continue operation of a particular facility beyond its useful life. However, when a facility is declared obsolete, the site must nonetheless be maintained in public recreation use following discontinuance of the assisted facility. Failure to so maintain is considered to be a conversion. Requests regarding changes from a UPARR funded facility to another otherwise eligible facility at the same site that significantly contravene the original plans for the area must be made in writing to the Regional Director. NPS approval must be obtained prior to the occurrence of the change. NPS approval is not necessarily required, however, for each and every facility use change. Rather, a project area should be viewed in the context of overall use and should be monitored in this context. A change from UPARR-developed tennis courts to basketball courts, for example, would not require NPS approval. A change from a swimming pool <PRTPAGE P="463"/>to a less intense area of limited development such as picnic facilities, or vice versa, would, however, require NPS review and approval. To assure that facility changes do not significantly contravene the original project agreement, NPS shall be notified by the recipient of <E T="03">all</E> proposed changes in advance of their occurrence. A primary NPS consideration in the review of requests for changes in use will be the consistency of the proposal with the Recovery Action Program and/or equivalent recreation plans. Changes to other than public recreation use require NPS approval and the substitution of replacement land in accordance with section 1010 of the UPARR Act and paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Residency requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Background.</E> UPARR policy prohibits discrimination on the basis of residence (refer to § 72.65(b)) including preferential reservation or membership systems on properties improved with UPARR assistance. This prohibition applies to both regularly scheduled and special events. The general provisions regarding non-discrimination at sites assisted under Interior programs and, thereby, all other recreation facilities managed by the recipient, are covered in 43 CFR part 17 which implements the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for the Department.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Policy.</E> There shall be no discrimination for UPARR assisted programs or services on the basis of residence, except in reasonable fee differentials. Post-completion compliance responsibilities of the recipient should continue to ensure that discrimination on the basis of residency is not occurring.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees.</E> For parks or recreation properties or programs funded with UPARR assistance, fees charged to nonresidents cannot exceed twice that charged to residents. Where there is no charge for residents but a fee is charged to nonresidents, the nonresident fees cannot exceed fees charged at comparable State or local public facilities having fee systems. These fee provisions apply only to the approved 1010 areas applicable to the recipient. Reservation, membership, or annual permit systems available to residents must also be available to nonresidents and the period of availability must be the same for both residents and nonresidents. Recipients are prohibited from providing residents the option of purchasing annual or daily permits while at the same time restricting nonresidents to the purchase of annual permits only.</P>

            <EAR>Pt. 72, App. A</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 72—Criteria for Eligibility</HD>
            <P>Jurisdictions were considered for eligibility if they were functioning general purpose local governments in one of three categories:</P>
            <P>1. Central cities of Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas in either 1970 or 1976 (1970 data derived from U.S. Bureau of the Census, Census of Population: 1970, 1976 data derived from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1976 Revenue Sharing Estimates File).</P>
            <P>2. Cities and townships with Populations of 40,000 or more in either 1970 or 1976 (1970 data derived from U.S. Bureau of the Census, Census of Population: 1970, 1976 data derived from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1976 Revenue Sharing Estimates File).</P>
            <P>3. Counties with populations of 250,000 or more in either 1970 or 1976 (1970 data derived from U.S. Bureau of the Census, Census of Population: 1970; 1976 data derived from 1976 Revenue Sharing Estimates File).</P>

            <P>Indicators (variables) of distress and need were selected to determine eligibility for the program and were chosen for timeliness, reliability, and relevance to the Act. Certain variables were not used due to duplication, others because they were not available for all jurisdictions, and some because they were unrelated to the purposes of the Act. (Section 1002 of the Act states that the Congress finds that (a) the quality of life in urban areas is closely related to the availability of fully functional park and recreation systems including land, facilities, and service programs; (b) residents of cities need close-to-home recreational opportunities that are adequate to specialized urban demands, with parks and facilities properly located, developed, and well maintained; (c) the greatest recreational deficiencies with respect to land, facilities, and programs are found in many large cities, especially at the neighborhood level; (d) inadequate financing of urban recreation programs due to fiscal difficulties in many large cities has led to the deterioration of facilities, nonavailability of recreation services, and an inability to adapt <PRTPAGE P="464"/>recreational programs to changing circumstances; and (e) there is no existing Federal assistance program which fully addresses the needs for physical rehabilitation and revitalization of these park and recreation systems.)</P>
            <P>The National Park Service asked the Bureau of the Census to assist in the analysis of national data in order to ensure that reliable, timely and applicable indicators of distress were used in determining eligibility for the program. NPS received comments from a number of interested individuals on what they considered, in their best judgment, to be the criteria that should be used in the program. NPS also received numerous position papers from national interest groups on what they thought were suitable indicators for the program. NPS then began a narrowing process intended to select the most appropriate criteria for eligibility in the program.</P>
            <P>Listed below are the six variables selected for eligibility criteria:</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Population Per Square Mile</HD>
            <P>This variable is commonly termed population density, and it is defined as the number of persons per square mile of land. It provides an indication of the extent to which an area is urbanized. Highly urbanized areas are most lacking in land set aside for recreation and park facilities and are experiencing difficulty in maintaining existing facilities. Highly dense areas tend to have the greatest need for assistance in revitalization of their neighborhood park and recreation facilities. Therefore, jurisdictions having high values for density would be favored by this variable, based on 1975 data of the U.S. Bureau of the Census.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Net Change in Per Capita Income 1969-75</HD>
            <P>Per capita income is the estimated average amount of total money income per person. It is derived by dividing the total income of a particular group by the total population in that group. Comparison of change in per capita income between urban jurisdictions provides an indication of each jurisdiction's economic growth. If the income of a city is growing more slowly than another city, the city with slower growth is in a relatively weaker economic position. As cited in the “Report on the Fiscal Impact of the Economic Stimulus Package on 48 Large Urban Governments (1978),” income growth is a determinant of taxable wealth and level of economic activity, and indicates a jurisdiction's capability to finance its own recreation and other projects. This measure of financial capacity is related to the Act which stipulates that the Secretary of the Interior consider factors related to economic distress. Therefore, jurisdictions with either negative or low relative growth in per capita income would be favored by this variable, based on 1976 data of the U.S. Bureau of the Census.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Percent Unemployed, 1977</HD>

            <P>Percent unemployed, commonly termed the unemployment rate is defined as the number of people unemployed as a percent of the civilian labor force. The unemployment data are the product of a Federal/State cooperative program in which State Employment Security agencies prepare labor force and unemployment estimates using concepts, definitions, and technical procedures established by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The <E T="03">National Urban Recreation Study</E> found that recreation and leisure time opportunities are most limited for the economically disadvantaged, including the unemployed. The 17 field studies of the <E T="03">National Urban Recreation Study</E> reveal that low-income neighborhoods have less program diversity, little, if any, commercial recreation opportunities, and fewer year-round programs than higher income neighborhoods. Consideration of this variable is consistent with the mandate of the Act which requires that criteria be considered related to physical and economic distress. Therefore, this variable would tend to favor jurisdictions having high unemployment rates.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Percent of Households Without Automobiles Available, 1970</HD>

            <P>Automobile availability, as defined by the Bureau of the Census, represents the number of passenger automobiles, including station wagons, which are owned or regularly used by any member of the household and which are ordinarily kept at home. Taxicabs, pickups, or larger trucks were not counted. Lack of automobile availability is closely related to lack of recreation opportunity. The Recreation Access Study (U.S. Department of Transportation, 1975) found that access to a diversity of recreation opportunities is generally assured for those who have automobiles and are willing to travel reasonable distances, but such opportunities are often severely limited for people without cars. In addition, the 17 field studies of the <E T="03">National Urban Recreation Study</E> concluded that most recreation opportunities for those without access to a personal auto is limited to immediate neighborhoods or place of residence. This variable is relevant to the Act in that the transportation disadvantaged households are the group that has the greatest need for expanded opportunities to enjoy their close to home resources.</P>

            <P>Therefore, jurisdictions having a high proportion of households without automobiles would be favored by this variable, based on 1970 data of the U.S. Bureau of the Census.<PRTPAGE P="465"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Total Population Under 18 Years of Age, and 60 Years and Over, 1970</HD>
            <P>This variable identifies those persons most likely to be the most frequent users of public park and recreation facilities. While many senior citizens have adequate incomes, they tend to be considerably less affluent and less mobile than the general population. Younger and older children also need public recreation facilities, especially in highly urbanized areas, where recreation facilities are most lacking. This variable was selected to favor areas with greater concentrations of the dependent population where need for recreation would be the greatest, and where rehabilitation of existing facilities the most pressing, in accordance with the Act. The variable was used in its absolute rate to give an indication of the size of the client populations in each jurisdiction, based on 1970 data of the U.S. Bureau of the Census.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Percent Persons With Income Below 125 Percent Poverty Level, 1970</HD>
            <P>In 1970, percent of population below poverty level was calculated by the Bureau of the Census as the proportion of the total population which reported income below the poverty level. This variable is the most current available indicator of poverty status for the jurisdictions in question. To accommodate the needs of economically disadvantaged people whose incomes are somewhat above the poverty level, such as those employed part-time, or those in very low-paid jobs, persons with incomes up to 125% of poverty are included in this variable. The poor and near-poor have the greatest need for public recreation opportunities and services in proximity to their homes. This variable is also related to that part of the Act which stipulates that the Secretary of the Interior consider “deficiencies in access to neighborhood recreation facilities, particularly for . . . low- and moderate-income residents,” and the extent to which park and recreation recovery efforts would provide employment opportunities for low- and moderate-income residents. Rehabilitation of parks is a relatively labor intensive activity having the potential for providing short-term jobs with low-skill requirements. Persons with poverty level incomes tend to lack skills and jobs. Therefore, this variable was selected to favor jurisdictions having a large percentage of its population in poverty. The poverty level of income is based on an index developed by the Social Security Administration in 1964 and subsequently modified by a Federal Interagency Committee. In 1969, the poverty thresholds ranged from $1,487 for a female unrelated individual 65 years old and over living on a farm to $6,116 for a nonfarm family with a male head and with seven or more persons. The average poverty threshold for a nonfarm family of four headed by a male was $3,745.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Determination of Eligibility</HD>
            <P>The method used to combine the variables had four steps. First, all values for each of the six variables were expressed in common or standard units. Second, for each jurisdiction, the standardized values for the six variables were added to produce a score. Third, the scores were ranked from high values (most eligible) to low values (least eligible). Fourth jurisdictions having scores above the median score for all jurisdictions were designated “eligible.”</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">County Eligibility</HD>
            <P>The Administration stated before the Senate Subcommittee on Parks and Recreation on June 27, 1978, that it would ensure fair consideration of urban counties for eligibility under the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program. The Administration has kept this commitment by subjecting urban county data to the same eligibility standards as cities and including urban counties which meet those standards on the eligibility list. All urban counties with a population over 250,000 were considered under the same criteria (indicators of distress and need) as the city counterparts. Counties within and SMSA not on the eligibility list may compete for assistance as discretionary applicants.</P>
            <P>The history of the Administration's UPARR proposal clearly indicates that this program is part of an overall national urban policy. Therefore, in accordance with the legislative mandate, project selection criteria will require that county projects be justified in terms of direct service to identifiable urban neighborhoods (residential areas), and that there must be evidence of cooperation between a county and its major city.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Discretionary Grants</HD>
            <P>Section 1005(b) of the Bill states that at the Secretary's discretion, up to 15 percent of the program funds annually may be granted to local governments which do not meet eligibility criteria, but are located in Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas, provided that these grants to general purpose governments are in accord with the intent of the program. These governments may apply for grants under the program regardless of whether or not they are included on the list of eligible jurisdictions.</P>

          <P>The policies and procedures contained herein are based on the authority of the Secretary of the Interior under title IV of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-515; 94 Stat. 3000; 16 U.S.C. 470a-1, a-2) which directs the Secretary to ensure and direct U.S. participation in the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, approved by the U.S. Senate on October 26, 1973, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 73.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>World Heritage nomination process.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">What is the U.S. World Heritage nomination process?</E> (1) The Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks (“Assistant Secretary”) is the designated official who conducts the United States World Heritage Program and periodically nominates properties to the World Heritage List on behalf of the United States. The National Park Service (NPS) provides staff support to the Assistant Secretary.</P>

          <P>(2) The Assistant Secretary initiates the process for identifying candidate properties for the World Heritage List <PRTPAGE P="470"/>and subsequently preparing, evaluating, and approving U.S. nominations for them by publishing a First Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> This notice includes a list of candidate sites (formally known as the Indicative Inventory of Potential Future U.S. World Heritage nominations) and requests that public and private sources recommend properties for nomination.</P>
          <P>(3) The Assistant Secretary, with advice from the Federal Interagency Panel for World Heritage (“Panel”), may propose for possible nomination a limited number of properties from the Indicative Inventory.</P>
          <P>(4) Property owners, in cooperation with NPS, voluntarily prepare a detailed nomination document for their property that has been proposed for nomination. The Panel reviews the accuracy and completeness of draft nominations, and makes recommendations on them to the Assistant Secretary.</P>
          <P>(5) The Assistant Secretary decides whether to nominate any of the proposed properties and transmits approved United States nominations, through the Department of State, to the World Heritage Committee to be considered for addition to the World Heritage List.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">What requirements must a U.S. property meet to be considered for nomination to the World Heritage List?</E> A property in the United States must satisfy the following requirements established by law and one or more of the World Heritage Criteria before the Assistant Secretary can consider it for World Heritage nomination:</P>
          <P>(1) The property must be nationally significant. For the purposes of this section, a property qualifies as “nationally significant” if it is:</P>

          <P>(i) A property that the Secretary of the Interior has designated as a National Historic Landmark (36 CFR part 65) or a National Natural Landmark (36 CFR part 62) under provisions of the 1935 Historic Sites Act (Public Law 74-292; 49 Stat. 666; 16 U.S.C. 461 <E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
          <P>(ii) An area the United States Congress has established as nationally significant; or</P>
          <P>(iii) An area the President has proclaimed as a National Monument under the Antiquities Act of 1906 (16 U.S.C. 433).</P>
          <P>(2) The property's owner(s) must concur in writing to the nomination.</P>
          <P>(i) If a unit of United States government (Federal, State, and/or local) owns or controls the property, a letter from the owner(s) demonstrates concurrence.</P>
          <P>(ii) If private parties own or control the property, they must provide the protection agreement outlined in § 73.13(c).</P>
          <P>(iii) All owners must concur before the Assistant Secretary can include their property within a World Heritage nomination. For example, a responsible Federal management official can concur for the unit, but cannot concur for any non-Federal property interest within the boundaries of the unit. NPS will seek the concurrence of those who own or control any non-Federal property interest if we determine that the property interest is integral to the entire property's outstanding universal values.</P>
          <P>(3) The nomination document must include evidence of such legal protections as may be necessary to ensure the preservation of the property and its environment. Section 73.13 identifies the distinct protection requirements for public and private properties.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">How does the U.S. World Heritage nomination process begin?</E> The Assistant Secretary, through the NPS, will periodically publish a First Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to begin the U.S. World Heritage nomination process. This notice, among other things:</P>
          <P>(1) Sets forth the schedule and procedures for identifying proposed U.S. nominations to the World Heritage List. It includes specific deadlines for receipt of suggestions and comments, and for preparing and approving nomination documents for properties proposed as U.S. nominations;</P>
          <P>(2) Includes the Indicative Inventory of Potential Future U.S. World Heritage Nominations (Indicative Inventory), solicits recommendations on which properties on it should be nominated, and requests suggestions of properties that should be considered for addition to it; and</P>

          <P>(3) Identifies any special requirements that properties must satisfy to be considered for nomination.<PRTPAGE P="471"/>
          </P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">What is the Indicative Inventory and how is it used?</E> (1) The World Heritage Convention (Article 11) requests each signatory nation to submit a list of candidate sites for the World Heritage List. These lists are also known as tentative lists, or Indicative Inventories. The NPS compiles and maintains the U.S. Indicative Inventory, which is formally known as the Indicative Inventory of Potential Future U.S. World Heritage Nominations. It is a list of cultural and natural properties located in the United States that, based on preliminary examination, appear to qualify for the World Heritage List and that the United States may consider for nomination to the List.</P>
          <P>(2) Inclusion of a property on the Indicative Inventory does not confer World Heritage status on it, but merely indicates that the Assistant Secretary may further examine the property for possible nomination. The Assistant Secretary selects proposed nominations from among the potential future nominations included on the Indicative Inventory. Thus, the Assistant Secretary uses the Indicative Inventory as the basis for selecting United States nominations, and it provides a comparative framework within which to judge the outstanding universal value of a property. Any agency, organization, or individual may recommend additional properties, with accompanying documentation, for inclusion on the Indicative Inventory. Ordinarily, a property must have been listed on the Indicative Inventory before the Assistant Secretary can consider it for nomination.</P>

          <P>(3) The Assistant Secretary, in cooperation with the Panel and other sources as appropriate, decides whether to include a recommended property on the Indicative Inventory. If a property is included, NPS will list it the next time we publish the Indicative Inventory in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The Assistant Secretary periodically transmits a copy of the Indicative Inventory, including documentation on each property's location and significance, to the World Heritage Committee for use in evaluation of nominations.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">How are U.S. World Heritage nominations proposed?</E> (1) After the First Notice's comment period expires, NPS compiles all suggestions and comments. The Assistant Secretary then reviews the comments and suggestions and works in cooperation with the Federal Interagency Panel for World Heritage to decide whether to identify any properties as proposed U.S. nominations. In addition to how well the property satisfies the World Heritage criteria (§ 73.9) and the legislative requirements outlined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Assistant Secretary may consider:</P>
          <P>(i) How well the particular type of property (i.e., theme or region) is represented on the World Heritage List;</P>
          <P>(ii) The balance between cultural and natural properties already on the List and those under consideration;</P>
          <P>(iii) Opportunities that the property affords for public visitation, interpretation, and education;</P>
          <P>(iv) Potential threats to the property's integrity or its current state of preservation; and</P>
          <P>(v) Other relevant factors, including public interest and awareness of the property.</P>
          <P>(2) Selection as a proposed nomination indicates that a property appears to qualify for World Heritage status and that the Assistant Secretary will encourage the preparation of a complete nomination document for the property.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Who is notified when U.S. World Heritage nominations are proposed?</E> (1) The Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks publishes notice of decisions on proposed U.S. nominations in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> (Second Notice). If any properties are identified as proposed nominations, the Assistant Secretary also notifies the following parties in writing:</P>
          <P>(i) The owner(s) of lands or interests of land that are to be included in the nomination; and</P>
          <P>(ii) The House Resources Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.</P>

          <P>(2) The Second Notice advises the recipients of the proposed action, references these rules, and sets forth the process for preparing a nomination. NPS also prepares and issues a press release on the proposed nomination.<PRTPAGE P="472"/>
          </P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">How is a U.S. World Heritage Nomination prepared?</E> NPS coordinates arrangements for the preparation of a complete nomination document for each proposed property. If you are a property owner(s), you, in cooperation with NPS, are responsible for preparing the draft nomination and for gathering documentation in support of it. NPS oversees the preparation of the nomination and ensures that it follows the procedures contained in these rules and the format and procedural guidelines established by the World Heritage Committee. Each nomination is prepared according to the schedule set forth in the First Notice.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">How is a draft U.S. World Heritage nomination evaluated?</E> The draft nomination document serves as the basis for the Assistant Secretary's decision to nominate the property to the World Heritage Committee. NPS coordinates the review and evaluation of draft World Heritage nominations. We distribute copies to all members of the Federal Interagency Panel for World Heritage and request comments regarding the significance of the property and the adequacy of the draft nomination. Afterward, we compile the recommendations and comments received from the members of the Panel.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">How is a U.S. World Heritage nomination approved and submitted?</E> (1) The Assistant Secretary, based on personal evaluation and the recommendations from the Panel, may nominate a property that appears to meet the World Heritage criteria to the World Heritage Committee on behalf of the United States. The Assistant Secretary sends an approved nomination document, through the Department of State, to the World Heritage Committee. The nomination document should be transmitted so that the World Heritage Committee receives it before the deadline established for any given year.</P>
          <P>(2) Nomination by the United States does not place a property on the World Heritage List. The World Heritage Committee must consider and approve the nomination, usually at a meeting during the year following its nomination, before it is inscribed as a World Heritage Site.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Who is notified when a U.S. property has been nominated to the World Heritage List?</E> (1) Upon approving a nomination, the Assistant Secretary notifies the following parties in writing (Third Notice):</P>
          <P>(i) The owner(s) of land or interests in land that are included in the nomination;</P>
          <P>(ii) The House Resources Committee; and</P>
          <P>(iii) The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.</P>

          <P>(2) The Assistant Secretary also publishes notice of the United States World Heritage nomination in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> In addition, NPS issues a press release on the nomination.</P>

          <SUBJECT>World Heritage criteria.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">What are the World Heritage criteria and how are they applied?</E> The World Heritage Committee uses the following criteria to evaluate cultural and natural properties nominated to the World Heritage List. To qualify for addition to the World Heritage List, sites must meet one or more of the criteria. For information on how to apply the criteria, you should consult their annotated text in the Operational Guidelines for the World Heritage Convention. The Operational Guidelines are published periodically by the World Heritage Centre. You may obtain copies of the World Heritage Convention, the Operational Guidelines, and other program information upon request to the Office of International Affairs of the National Park Service, 1849 C Street, NW., Room 2242, Washington, DC 20240. The World Heritage Convention and the Operational Guidelines are also posted on the World Heritage Centre's Web site at <E T="03">www.unesco.org/whc.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">What are the cultural criteria?</E> The criteria for the inclusion of cultural properties in the World Heritage List should always be seen in relation to one another and should be considered in the context of the definition set out in Article 1 of the Convention. A monument, group of buildings or site—as defined in Article 1 of the Convention—which is nominated for inclusion in the World Heritage List will be considered to be of outstanding universal value for the purpose of the Convention when the Committee finds that it meets one <PRTPAGE P="473"/>or more of the following criteria and the test of authenticity:</P>
          <P>(1) Each property nominated should therefore:</P>
          <P>(i) Represent a masterpiece of human creative genius; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared; or</P>
          <P>(iv) Be an outstanding example of a type of building or architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates a significant stage(s) in human history; or</P>
          <P>(v) Be an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement or land-use which is representative of a culture (or cultures), especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change; or</P>
          <P>(vi) Be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance (the Committee considers that this criterion should justify inclusion in the List only in exceptional circumstances and in conjunction with other criteria cultural or natural).</P>
          <P>(2) In addition to the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(vi) of this section, the sites should also meet the test of authenticity in design, material, workmanship or setting and in the case of cultural landscapes their distinctive character and components (the Committee stressed that reconstruction is only acceptable if it is carried out on the basis of complete and detailed documentation on the original and to no extent on conjecture) and have adequate legal and/or contractual and/or traditional protection and management mechanisms to ensure the conservation of the nominated cultural properties or cultural landscapes.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">What are the natural criteria?</E> A natural heritage property—as defined in Article 2 of the Convention—which is submitted for inclusion in the World Heritage List will be considered to be of outstanding universal value for the purposes of the Convention when the Committee finds that it meets one or more of the following criteria specified by the Operational Guidelines and fulfills the conditions of integrity:</P>
          <P>(1) Sites nominated should therefore:</P>
          <P>(i) Be outstanding examples representing major stages of earth's history, including the record of life, significant on-going geological processes in the development of landforms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Be outstanding examples representing significant on-going ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial, fresh water, coastal and marine ecosystems and communities of plants and animals; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Contain superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance; or</P>
          <P>(iv) Contain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation.</P>
          <P>(2) In addition to the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section, the sites should also fulfill the following conditions of integrity:</P>
          <P>(i) The sites described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section should contain all or most of the key interrelated and interdependent elements in their natural relationships.</P>
          <P>(ii) The sites described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section should have sufficient size and contain the necessary elements to demonstrate the key aspects of processes that are essential for the long-term conservation of the ecosystems and the biological diversity they contain.</P>
          <P>(iii) The sites described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section should be of outstanding aesthetic value and include areas that are essential for maintaining the beauty of the site.</P>

          <P>(iv) The sites described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section should contain habitats for maintaining the most diverse fauna and flora characteristic of the biogeographic province and ecosystems under consideration.<PRTPAGE P="474"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) The sites should have a management plan. When a site does not have a management plan at the time when it is nominated for the consideration of the World Heritage Committee, the State Party concerned should indicate when such a plan will become available and how it proposes to mobilize the resources required for the preparation and implementation of the plan. The State Party should also provide other document(s) (e.g. operational plans) which will guide the management of the site until such time when a management plan is finalized.</P>

Subsection 110(j) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations under which the requirements in section 110 may be waived in whole or in part in the event of a major natural disaster or an imminent threat to the national security. Waiver of responsibilities under section 110 does not affect an agency's section 106 responsibilities for taking into account the effects of emergency activities on properties included in or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places and for affording the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation an opportunity to comment on such activities.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The regulations in this part establish definitions, standards, procedures and guidelines to be followed by Federal agencies to preserve collections of prehistoric and historic material remains, and associated records, recovered under the authority of the Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431-433), the Reservoir Salvage Act (16 U.S.C. 469-469<E T="03">c</E>), section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470<E T="03">h</E>-2) or the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470<E T="03">aa-mm</E>). They establish:</P>
          <P>(1) Procedures and guidelines to manage and preserve collections;</P>

          <P>(2) Terms and conditions for Federal agencies to include in contracts, memoranda, agreements or other written instruments with repositories for curatorial services;<PRTPAGE P="478"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) Standards to determine when a repository has the capability to provide long-term curatorial services; and</P>
          <P>(4) Guidelines to provide access to, loan and otherwise use collections.</P>
          <P>(b) The regulations in this part contain three appendices that provide additional guidance for use by the Federal Agency Official.</P>
          <P>(1) Appendix A to these regulations contains an example of an agreement between a Federal agency and a non- Federal owner of material remains who is donating the remains to the Federal agency.</P>
          <P>(2) Appendix B to these regulations contains an example of a memorandum of understanding between a Federal agency and a repository for long-term curatorial services for a federally-owned collection.</P>
          <P>(3) Appendix C to these regulations contains an example of an agreement between a repository and a third party for a short-term loan of a federally-owned collection (or a part thereof).</P>
          <P>(4) The three appendices are meant to illustrate how such agreements might appear. They should be revised according to the:</P>
          <P>(i) Needs of the Federal agency and any non-Federal owner;</P>
          <P>(ii) Nature and content of the collection; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Type of contract, memorandum, agreement or other written instrument being used.</P>
          <P>(5) When a repository has preexisting standard forms (e.g., a short-term loan form) that are consistent with the regulations in this part, those forms may be used in lieu of developing new ones.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Management and preservation of collections.</SUBJECT>

          <P>The Federal Agency Official is responsible for the long-term management and preservation of preexisting and new collections subject to this part. Such collections shall be placed in a repository with adequate long-term curatorial capabilities, as set forth in § 79.9 of this part, appropriate <PRTPAGE P="482"/>to the nature and content of the collections.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Preexisting collections.</E> The Federal Agency Official is responsible for ensuring that preexisting collections, meaning those collections that are placed in repositories prior to the effective date of this rule, are being properly managed and preserved. The Federal Agency Official shall identify such repositories, and review and evaluate the curatorial services that are being provided to preexisting collections. When the Federal Agency Official determines that such a repository does not have the capability to provide adequate long-term curatorial services, as set forth in § 79.9 of this part, the Federal Agency Official may either:</P>
          <P>(1) Enter into or amend an existing contract, memorandum, agreement or other appropriate written instrument for curatorial services for the purpose of:</P>
          <P>(i) Identifying specific actions that shall be taken by the repository, the Federal agency or other appropriate party to eliminate the inadequacies;</P>
          <P>(ii) Specifying a reasonable period of time and a schedule within which the actions shall be completed; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Specifying any necessary funds or services that shall be provided by the repository, the Federal agency or other appropriate party to complete the actions; or</P>
          <P>(2) Remove the collections from the repository and deposit them in another repository that can provide such services in accordance with the regulations in this part. Prior to moving any collection that is from Indian lands, the Federal Agency Official must obtain the written consent of the Indian landowner and the Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the lands.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">New collections.</E> The Federal Agency Official shall deposit a collection in a repository upon determining that:</P>
          <P>(1) The repository has the capability to provide adequate long-term curatorial services, as set forth in § 79.9 of this part;</P>
          <P>(2) The repository's facilities, written curatorial policies and operating procedures are consistent with the regulations in this part;</P>
          <P>(3) The repository has certified, in writing, that the collection shall be cared for, maintained and made accessible in accordance with the regulations in this part and any terms and conditions that are specified by the Federal Agency Official;</P>
          <P>(4) When the collection is from Indian lands, written consent to the disposition has been obtained from the Indian landowner and the Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the lands; and</P>
          <P>(5) The initial processing of the material remains (including appropriate cleaning, sorting, labeling, cataloging, stabilizing and packaging) has been completed, and associated records have been prepared and organized in accordance with the repository's processing and documentation procedures.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Retention of records by Federal agencies.</E> The Federal Agency Official shall maintain administrative records on the disposition of each collection including, but not limited to:</P>
          <P>(1) The name and location of the repository where the collection is deposited;</P>
          <P>(2) A copy of the contract, memorandum, agreement or other appropriate written instrument, and any subsequent amendments, between the Federal agency, the repository and any other party for curatorial services;</P>
          <P>(3) A catalog list of the contents of the collection that is deposited in the repository;</P>
          <P>(4) A list of any other Federal personal property that is furnished to the repository as a part of the contract, memorandum, agreement or other appropriate written instrument for curatorial services;</P>
          <P>(5) Copies of reports documenting inspections, inventories and investigations of loss, damage or destruction that are conducted pursuant to § 79.11 of this part; and</P>

          <SUBJECT>Methods to secure curatorial services.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Federal agencies may secure curatorial services using a variety of methods, subject to Federal procurement and property management statutes, regulations, and any agency-specific <PRTPAGE P="483"/>statutes and regulations on the management of museum collections. Methods that may be used by Federal agencies to secure curatorial services include, but are not limited to:</P>
          <P>(1) Placing the collection in a repository that is owned, leased or otherwise operated by the Federal agency;</P>
          <P>(2) Entering into a contract or purchase order with a repository for curatorial services;</P>
          <P>(3) Entering into a cooperative agreement, a memorandum of understanding, a memorandum of agreement or other agreement, as appropriate, with a State, local or Indian tribal repository, a university, museum or other scientific or educational institution that operates or manages a repository, for curatorial services;</P>
          <P>(4) Entering into an interagency agreement with another Federal agency for curatorial services;</P>
          <P>(5) Transferring the collection to another Federal agency for preservation; and</P>

          <P>(6) For archeological activities permitted on public or Indian lands under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470 <E T="03">aa-mm</E>), the Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431-433) or other authority, requiring the archeological permittee to provide for curatorial services as a condition to the issuance of the archeological permit.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Guidelines for selecting a repository.</E> (1) When possible, the collection should be deposited in a repository that:</P>
          <P>(i) Is in the State of origin;</P>
          <P>(ii) Stores and maintains other collections from the same site or project location; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Houses collections from a similar geographic region or cultural area.</P>
          <P>(2) The collection should not be subdivided and stored at more than a single repository unless such subdivision is necessary to meet special storage, conservation or research needs.</P>
          <P>(3) Except when non-federally-owned material remains are retained and disposed of by the owner, material remains and associated records should be deposited in the same repository to maintain the integrity and research value of the collection.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Sources for technical assistance.</E> The Federal Agency Official should consult with persons having expertise in the management and preservation of collections prior to preparing a scope of work or a request for proposals for curatorial services. This will help ensure that the resulting contract, memorandum, agreement or other written instrument meets the needs of the collection, including any special needs in regard to any religious remains.

          <SUBJECT>Methods to fund curatorial services.</SUBJECT>
          <P>A variety of methods are used by Federal agencies to ensure that sufficient funds are available for adequate, long-term care and maintenance of collections. Those methods include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>

          <P>(a) Federal agencies may fund a variety of curatorial activities using monies appropriated annually by the U.S. Congress, subject to any specific statutory authorities or limitations applicable to a particular agency. As appropriate, curatorial activities that may be funded by Federal agencies include, but are not limited to:<PRTPAGE P="484"/>
          </P>
          <P>(1) Purchasing, constructing, leasing, renovating, upgrading, expanding, operating, and maintaining a repository that has the capability to provide adequate long-term curatorial services as set forth in § 79.9 of this part;</P>
          <P>(2) Entering into and maintaining on a cost-reimbursable or cost-sharing basis a contract, memorandum, agreement, or other appropriate written instrument with a repository that has the capability to provide adequate long-term curatorial services as set forth in § 79.9 of this part;</P>

          <P>(3) As authorized under section 110(g) of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470<E T="03">h</E>-2), reimbursing a grantee for curatorial costs paid by the grantee as a part of the grant project;</P>

          <P>(4) As authorized under section 110(g) of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470<E T="03">h</E>-2), reimbursing a State agency for curatorial costs paid by the State agency to carry out the historic preservation responsibilities of the Federal agency;</P>
          <P>(5) Conducting inspections and inventories in accordance with § 79.11 of this part; and</P>
          <P>(6) When a repository that is housing and maintaining a collection can no longer provide adequate long-term curatorial services, as set forth in § 79.9 of this part, either:</P>
          <P>(i) Providing such funds or services as may be agreed upon pursuant to § 79.5(a)(1) of this part to assist the repository in eliminating the deficiencies; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Removing the collection from the repository and depositing it in another repository that can provide curatorial services in accordance with the regulations in this part.</P>

          <P>(b) As authorized under section 110(g) of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470<E T="03">h</E>-2) and section 208(2) of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments (16 U.S.C. 469<E T="03">c</E>-2), for federally licensed or permitted projects or programs, Federal agencies may charge licensees and permittees reasonable costs for curatorial activities associated with identification, surveys, evaluation and data recovery as a condition to the issuance of a Federal license or permit.</P>

          <P>(c) Federal agencies may deposit collections in a repository that agrees to provide curatorial services at no cost to the U.S. Government. This generally occurs when a collection is excavated or removed from public or Indian lands under a research permit issued pursuant to the Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431-433) or the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470<E T="03">aa-mm</E>). A repository also may agree to provide curatorial services as a public service or as a means of ensuring direct access to a collection for long-term study and use. Federal agencies should ensure that a repository that agrees to provide curatorial services at no cost to the U.S. Government has sufficient financial resources to support its operations and any needed improvements.</P>
          <P>(d) Funds provided to a repository for curatorial services should include costs for initially processing, cataloging and accessioning the collection as well as costs for storing, inspecting, inventorying, maintaining, and conserving the collection on a long-term basis.</P>
          <P>(1) Funds to initially process, catalog and accession a collection to be generated during identification and evaluation surveys should be included in project planning budgets.</P>
          <P>(2) Funds to initially process, catalog and accession a collection to be generated during data recovery operations should be included in project mitigation budgets.</P>
          <P>(3) Funds to store, inspect, inventory, maintain and conserve a collection on a long-term basis should be included in annual operating budgets.</P>

          <P>(e) When the Federal Agency Official determines that data recovery costs may exceed the one percent limitation contained in the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 469<E T="03">c</E>), as authorized under section 208(3) of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments (16 U.S.C. 469<E T="03">c</E>-2), the limitation may be waived, in appropriate cases, after the Federal Agency Official has:</P>

          <P>(1) Obtained the concurrence of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior by sending a written request to the Departmental Consulting Archeologist, National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013-7127; and<PRTPAGE P="485"/>
          </P>

          <P>(4) When a collection is from a site on public lands that the Federal Agency Official has determined is of religious or cultural importance to any Indian tribe having aboriginal or historic ties to such lands, the Federal Agency Official shall place such terms and conditions as may have been developed pursuant to § -.7 of uniform regulations 43 CFR part 7, 36 CFR part 296, 18 CFR part 1312, and 32 CFR part 229 on:</P>
          <P>(i) Scientific, educational or religious uses of material remains; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Access to associated records that contain information relating to the nature, location or character of the resource.</P>
          <P>(5) The Federal Agency Official shall not allow uses that would alter, damage or destroy an object in a collection unless the Federal Agency Official determines that such use is necessary for scientific studies or public interpretation, and the potential gain in scientific or interpretive information outweighs the potential loss of the object. When possible, such use should be limited to unprovenienced, nonunique, nonfragile objects, or to a sample of objects drawn from a larger collection of similar objects.</P>
          <P>(e) No collection (or a part thereof) shall be loaned to any person without a written agreement between the Repository Official and the borrower that specifies the terms and conditions of the loan. Appendix C to the regulations in this part contains an example of a short-term loan agreement for a federally-owned collection. At a minimum, a loan agreement shall specify:</P>

          <P>(4) Because frequent handling will accelerate the breakdown of fragile materials, material remains and records should be viewed but handled as little as possible during inspections and inventories.</P>
          <P>(5) Material remains and records of a valuable nature should be inventoried on a more frequent basis than other less valuable remains or records.</P>
          <P>(6) Persons such as those listed in § 79.6(c) of this part who have expertise in the management and preservation of similar collections should be able to provide advice to the Federal Agency Official concerning the appropriate frequency and methods for conducting inspections and inventories of a particular collection.</P>
          <P>(e) Consistent with the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 75), when two or more Federal agencies deposit collections in the same repository, the Federal Agency Officials should enter into an interagency agreement for the purposes of:</P>
          <P>(1) Requesting the Repository Official to coordinate the inspections and inventories, stipulated in paragraph (b) of this section, for each of the collections;</P>
          <P>(2) Designating one or more qualified Federal agency professionals to:</P>
          <P>(i) Conduct inspections, stipulated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, on behalf of the other agencies; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Following each inspection, prepare and distribute to each Federal Agency Official a written report of findings, including an evaluation of performance and recommendations to correct any deficiencies and resolve any problems that were identified. When the collection is from Indian lands, the Indian landowner and the Tribal Official of the Indian tribe that has jurisdiction over the lands shall also be provided with a copy of the report; and</P>
          <P>(3) Ensuring consistency in the conduct of inspections and inventories conducted pursuant to this section.</P>
